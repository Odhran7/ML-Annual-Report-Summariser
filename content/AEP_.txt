financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

aep’s revolving credit agreement which backstops the commercial paper program includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test in addition the acceleration of aep’s payment obligations or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local 

authorities the environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

operations for aep subsidiaries are subject to the cwa which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for water withdrawals at existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day a schedule for compliance with the standard is established by the permit agency and incorporated in npdes permits 

in november 2015 the federal epa issued a final rule revising elg for electricity generating facilities the rule established limits on fgd wastewater fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed in npdes permits as soon as possible after november 2018 and no later than december 2023 the federal epa further revised the rule in august 2020 for fgd wastewater and bottom ash transport water extending the compliance date to december 2025 and establishing additional options 

in january 2020 the federal epa issued a final rule revising the scope of the “waters of the united states” subject to cwa regulation in august 2021 this rule was vacated by a federal court and shortly thereafter in december 2021 the federal epa proposed a rule that would roll back the definition of “waters of the united states” to the pre2015 definition see “environmental issues  clean water act regulations” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

coal ash regulation 

aep’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion byproducts including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials a rule by the federal epa regulates the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close in august 2020 the federal epa revised the ccr rule to include a requirement that unlined ccr storage ponds cease operations and initiate closure by april 11 2021 the revised rule provides two options for seeking an extension of that date aep filed extension requests for seven facilities but as of december 31 2021 the federal epa had not acted upon any of those requests see “environmental issues  coal combustion residual ccr rule” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting aep’s power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the caa includes a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants and requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls collectively called the acid rain program aep continues to meet its obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets 

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips see “environmental issues  clean air act requirements” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

hazardous air pollutants hap 

the caa also requires the federal epa to investigate hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submit a report to congress to determine whether those emissions should be regulated in 2011 the federal epa issued a rule setting maximum achievable control technology standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards for emissions from new and modified power plants in 2014 the us supreme court determined that the federal epa acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hap emissions from electric generating units the federal epa has engaged in additional rulemaking activity but the 2011 rule remains in effect 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these protected areas in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

climate change 

aep has taken action to reduce and offset co 2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects co 2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities in 2021 aep announced revised intermediate and longterm co 2 emission reduction goals based on the company’s march 2021 climate impact analysis report the intermediate goal is an 80 reduction from 2000 co 2 emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is netzero co 2 emissions from aep generating facilities by 2050 aep’s total estimated co 2 emissions in 2021 were approximately 51 million metric tons a 70 reduction from aep’s 2000 co 2 emissions the company continues to work toward these goals through its integrated resource planning processes which take into account economics customer demand regulations grid reliability and resiliency 

to date the federal epa has twice taken action to regulate co 2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the caa the clean power plan was adopted in october 2015 but the us supreme court issued a stay of its implementation including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans the clean power plan was repealed by the federal epa in 2019 and replaced by the affordable clean energy ace rule which changed the federal epa’s approach to regulating co 2 emissions from existing coalfired generating units in january 2021 the ace rule was vacated by the us court of appeals 

for the district of columbia circuit dc circuit court and remanded to the federal epa for further proceedings in october 2021 the u s supreme court granted certiorari and combined four separate petitions seeking review of the dc circuit court decision briefing is underway but management is unable to predict the outcome of that litigation it is similarly too soon to predict how the federal epa will respond to the court’s remand management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as aep diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals 

transforming aep’s generation fleet 

the electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation driven by changing customer needs evolving public policies stakeholder demands demographics competitive offerings technologies and commodity prices aep is also transforming to be more agile and customerfocused as a valued provider of energy solutions aep’s longterm commitment to reduce co 2 emissions reflects the current direction of the company’s resource plans to meet those needs aep set new goals in 2021 to reduce carbon emissions by 80 by 2030 from a 2000 baseline and to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 these goals are supported by a climate impact analysis report published in 2021 aep’s exposure to carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years from 2000 to 2021 aep’s co 2 emissions declined 70 in 2021 coal represented 42 of aep’s generating capacity compared with 70 in 2005 transforming aep’s generation portfolio to include where there is regulatory support more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient use of energy demand response distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid over time is part of this strategy 

the graph below summarizes aep’s generation capacity by resource type for the years 1999 2005 and 2021 

a energy efficiencydemand response represents avoided capacity rather than physical assets 

renewable sources of energy 

the states aep serves other than kentucky oklahoma west virginia and tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources 

as of december 31 2021 aep’s regulated utilities had longterm contracts for 2750 mws of wind 80 mws of hydro and 3 0 mws of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers in addition im owns four solar projects that make up im’s 15 mw clean energy solar pilot project and its 20 mw st joseph solar facility went into operation in 2021 management actively manages aep’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

as of december 31 2021 apco has executed solar ppas totaling 55 mws either not eligible for or subject to regulatory preapproval of which 20 mws are in operation in 2021 apco also executed solar ppas for an additional 89 mws subject to regulatory approval including cost recovery during the year apco also entered into agreements to purchase three solar facilities totaling 205 mws and an agreement to purchase a 204 mw wind project subject to regulatory approval including cost recovery if approved these projects are all expected to be online by late 2024 or early 2025 

in 2020 pso received approval from the occ and swepco received approval from the apsc and lpsc to acquire the ncwf comprised of three oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1484 mws on a fixed cost turnkey basis at completion both the apsc and lpsc approved the flexup option agreeing to acquire the texas portion which the puct denied pso will own 455 and swepco will own 545 of the project which will cost approximately 2 billion the 199 mw sundance wind facility was acquired and placed in service in april 2021 and the 287 mw maverick wind facility was acquired and placed in service in september 2021 the 998 mw traverse wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed in service in the first quarter of 2022 

the growth of aep’s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs in addition to gradually reducing aep’s reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps aep to maintain a diversity of generation resources 

the integrated resource plans submitted to state regulatory commissions by aep’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect aep’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world aep has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources transmission assets of the aep system interconnect approximately 20600 mws of renewable energy resources aep’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources 

aep energy supply llc is a holding company with several divisions including aep renewables and aep onsite partners 

aep renewables develops owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the united states aep renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals as of december 31 2021 aep renewables owned projects operating in 11 states including approximately 1435 mws of installed wind capacity and 165 mws of installed solar capacity these figures include the 2020 acquisition of an additional 10 interest or approximately 30 mws of santa rita east wind generation located in west texas in october 2019 aep renewables entered into an agreement to construct flat ridge 3 a 128 mw wind farm facility in kansas which was placed into service in december 2021 in february 2022 aep management announced the beginning of a process to sell all or a portion of aep renewables’ competitive contracted renewables portfolio

end use energy efficiency 

beginning in 2008 aep ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available since that time aeps operating company’s programs have reduced annual consumption by over 96 million mwhs and peak demand by approximately 3099 mws aep estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 16 billion during that period to achieve these levels  

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states aep serves and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for aep operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments as aep continues to transition to a cleaner more efficient energy future energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers 

aep believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a costeffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of aep’s strategic plan the board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets the board of directors is informed of new environmental regulations and proposed environmental regulations or legislation that would significantly affect aep the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees aep’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about aep’s environmental social governance and financial performance aep set co 2 emission reduction goals in 2018 after considering input from its annual corporate governance outreach effort with shareholders 

in february 2021 aep announced new intermediate and longterm co 2 emission reduction goals the intermediate goal is an 80 reduction from 2000 co 2 emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is netzero co 2 emissions from aep generating facilities by 2050 aep has made significant 

progress in reducing co 2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline technological advances including advanced energy storage advanced nuclear reactors hydrogen production and public policies are among the factors that will determine how quickly aep can achieve netzero emissions while continuing to provide reliable affordable power for customers 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see “the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation” section of note 6 included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with environmental quality standards during 2019 2020 and 2021 and the current estimate for 2022 are shown below these investments include both environmental as well as other related spending estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital in addition to the amounts set forth below aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants’ facilities for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with environmental standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2021 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more stringent or in response to rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion byproducts the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system aep typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition see “environmental issues” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2021 annual report for additional information

business segments 

aep’s reportable segments 

aep’s primary business is the generation transmission and distribution of electricity within its vertically integrated utilities segment aep centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of costbased rates and regulatory oversight intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements aep’s reportable segments are as follows 

• vertically integrated utilities 

• transmission and distribution utilities 

• aep transmission holdco 

• generation  marketing 

the remainder of aep’s activities is presented as corporate and other which is not considered a reportable segment see note 9  business segments included in the 2021 annual report for additional information on aep’s segments 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2021 aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 22500 mws of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type including wind purchase agreements on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources or retirement of traditional fossil fuel units may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2021 fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities increased 68 on a dollar per 

mmbtu basis from 2020 due to an increase in commodity price largely due to the impact of the february 2021 severe winter weather event 

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers marketers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2021 increased approximately 26 from 2020 mainly due to higher gas prices and stronger power market prices 

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls 3014 railcars 343 barges 5 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in aep generating facilities aep will be selling one boat and 74 barges will be coming off lease in the first quarter of 2022 and will not be extended 

spot prices began 2021 at similar levels to 2020 but strengthened significantly in the back half of 2021 due to an increase in global and domestic demand aep’s strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods and can occasionally cause current spot market prices to be trending opposite to the price of coal delivered the price paid for coal delivered in 2021 decreased approximately 59 from 2020 mainly due to the pricing of coal supply agreements entered into in previous years 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal and lignite purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2021 the vertically integrated utilities’ coal inventory was approximately 34 days of full load burn while inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the vertically integrated utilities is approximately 27 days of full load burn 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed approximately 108 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2021 for generating power this represents a decrease of 460 from 2020 several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability a portfolio of term seasonal monthly and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate aep’s natural gas supply transactions are based on market prices 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities the increase in 2021 average delivered price is largely due to the impact of the february 2021 severe winter weather event 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of snf im completed modifications to its snf storage pool in the early 1990’s im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of snf to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis the year of expiration of each nrc operating license is 2034 for unit 1 and 2037 for unit 2 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of snf and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the snf disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2021 the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant was 22 billion in 2021 nondiscounted dollars with additional ongoing estimated costs of 7 million per year for post decommissioning storage of snf and an eventual estimated cost of 33 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility also in 2021 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 35 billion and 3 billion respectively the balance of funds available to eventually decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

• escalation of various cost elements including but not limited to general inflation and the cost of energy 

• further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning 

• technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies 

• availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities 

• availability of a united states department of energy facility for permanent storage of snf 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections aep will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections see the “nuclear contingencies” section of note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2021 annual report for additional information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed lowlevel radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of lowlevel radioactive waste in the event that lowlevel radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable it can be stored onsite at this facility 

counterparty risk management 

the vertically integrated utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants as a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2021 counterparties posted approximately 10 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   210 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

im 

the upa between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 the im power agreement provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the im power agreement will continue in effect until the debt obligations of aegco secured by the rockport plant have been satisfied and discharged currently expected to be december 2028 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a upa between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the upa between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco upa expires in december 2022 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 parent owns 3917 and opco owns 43 under the intercompany power agreement icpa which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the icpa terminates in june 2040 the proceeds from charges by ovec to sponsoring companies under the icpa based on their power participation ratios are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs ovec’s board of directors as elected by aep and nonaffiliated owners has authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests with resulting expenses including for related debt and interest thereon included in charges under the icpa ovec financed capital expenditures in excess of 1 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with pjm and spp and as approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – competition 

transmission agreement 

apco im kgpco kpco and wpco own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the pjm oatt and are parties to the ta opco which is a subsidiary in aep’s transmission and distribution utilities segment that provides transmission service under the pjm oatt is also a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by pjm the ta has been approved by the ferc

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of much of the energy policy act of 2005 which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s costofservice generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed inservice provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4  rate matters included in the 2021 annual report for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a forecasted costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded through a fuel adjustment clause 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel cost recovery mechanism in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a combined costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through the enec which truesup to actual expenses in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through surcharges 

ferc 

the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and aep has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers in addition the ferc regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities at costbased rates and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees additionally the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the nerc with the approval of the ferc 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over certain issuances of securities of most of aep’s public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

competition 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they currently maintain a competitive position 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aep texas and opco opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1515000 retail customers in ohio opco purchases energy and capacity to serve standard service offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load aep texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1082000 retail customers through reps in west central and southern texas

aep transmission holdco 

general 

aepthco is a holding company for a aeptco which is the direct holding company for the state transcos and b aep’s transmission joint ventures 

aeptco 

aeptco wholly owns the state transcos which are independent of but respectively overlay the following aep electric utility operating companies apco im kpco opco pso swepco and wpco the state transcos develop own operate and maintain their respective transmission assets assets of the state transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and nonaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of pjm miso and spp aptco imtco ktco ohtco and wvtco are located within pjm imtco also owns portions of the greentown station assets located in miso oktco and swtco are located within spp 

imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions the virginia scc and wvpsc granted consent for apco and aptco to enter into a joint license agreement that will support aptco investment in the state of tennessee swtco does not currently own or operate transmission assets 

the state transcos are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the ferc and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems the state transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with the ferc the rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed roe these rates are then included in an oatt for pjm miso and spp

in september 2021 pjm notified transource energy that the iec was suspended to allow for the regulatory and related appeals process to proceed in an orderly manner without breaching milestone dates in the project agreement pjm stated that the iec has not been cancelled and remains necessary to alleviate congestion as of december 31 2021 aep’s share of iec capital expenditures was approximately 81 million the ferc has previously granted abandonment benefits for this project allowing the full recovery of prudently incurred costs if the project is cancelled for reasons outside the control of transource energy if any of the iec costs are not recoverable it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

regulation 

the state transcos and the transmission joint ventures located outside of ercot establish transmission rates annually through forwardlooking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to fercapproved implementation protocols the protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudentlyincurred and reasonably calculated the imtcoowned greentown station assets acquired from duke energy indiana llc in december 2018 are located in miso imtco utilizes a historic cost recovery model to recover miso assets 

the state transcos’ and the transmission joint ventures’ where applicable rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system the ferc requires transmission providers such as pjm and spp to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis 

the fercapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement atrr and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the ferc the formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous year’s billings allowing for overunderrecovery of the transmission owner’s atrr pjm and spp pay the transmission owners their atrr for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatt for the service taken additionally the state transcos are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the nerc with the approval of the ferc 

management continues to monitor the ferc’s 2019 notice of inquiry regarding base roe policy the ferc’s 2020 and 2021 supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking nopr regarding transmission incentives policy and various other matters pending before the ferc with the potential to affect the transmission roe methodology 

in april 2021 the ferc issued a supplemental nopr proposing to modify its incentive for transmission owners that join rtos rto incentive under the supplemental nopr the rto incentive would be modified such that a utility would only be eligible for the rto incentive for the first three years after the utility joins a fercapproved transmission organization this is a significant departure from a previous nopr issued in 2020 seeking to increase the rto incentive from 50 basis points to 100 basis points the supplemental nopr also required utilities 

that have received the rto incentive for three or more years to submit within 30 days of the effective date of a final rule a compliance filing to eliminate the incentive from its tariff prospectively the supplemental nopr was subject to a 60 day comment period followed by a 30 day period for reply comments in july 2021 aep submitted reply comments aep is awaiting a final rule from the ferc 

in july 2021 the ferc issued an order denying dayton power and light’s request for a 50 basis point rto incentive on the basis that its rto participation was not voluntary but rather is required by ohio law this precedent could have an impact on aep’s transmission owning subsidiaries 

in 2019 the ferc approved settlement agreements establishing base roes of 985 1035 inclusive of rto incentive adder of 05 and 10 105 inclusive of rto incentive adder of 05 for aep’s pjm and spp transmissionowning subsidiaries respectively in 2020 the ferc determined the base roe for miso’s transmission owning subsidiaries should be 1002 1052 inclusive of rto incentive adder of 05 

if the ferc modifies its rto incentive policy it would be applied as applicable to aep’s pjm spp and miso transmission owning subsidiaries on a prospective basis and could affect future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition based on management’s preliminary estimates if a final rule is adopted consistent with the april 2021 supplemental nopr it could reduce aep’s pretax income by approximately 55 million to 70 million on an annual basis 

in the annual rate base filings described above the state transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of 84 billion 70 billion and 59 billion for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the total filed transmission revenue requirements including prior year overunderrecovery of revenue and associated carrying charges were 14 billion 12 billion and 992 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the rates of ett which is located in ercot are determined by the puct ett sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim transmission cost of services tcos filings ett may file interim tcos filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital 

the transmission joint ventures have approved roes ranging from 96 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 

generation  marketing 

general 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of a wholesale energy trading and marketing business a retail supply and energy management business and competitive generating assets 

aep energy supply llc is a holding company with several divisions including aep renewables and aep onsite partners 

aep renewables develops owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the united states aep renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals as of december 31 2021 aep renewables owned projects operating in 11 states including approximately 1435 mws of installed wind capacity and 165 mws of installed solar capacity in october 2019 aep renewables entered into an agreement to construct flat ridge 3 a wind farm in kansas the 128 mw facility was placed into service in december 2021 in november 2020 aep renewables signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire 75 of the dry lake solar project a 100 mw solar facility in southern nevada this facility was placed into service in may 2021 in february 2022 aep management announced the beginning of a process to sell all or a portion of aep renewables’ competitive contracted renewables portfolio 

aep onsite partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities aep onsite partners targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers as of december 31 2021 aep onsite partners owned projects located in 22 states including approximately 161 mws of installed solar capacity and approximately 27 mws of solar projects under construction 

with respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries enter into shortterm and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ercot spp miso and pjm these subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities these activities primarily involve the purchaseandsale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent otc swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to the retail supply and energy management business aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity andor natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides various energy solutions in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy had approximately 552000 customer accounts as of december 31 2021 

the primary fossil generation subsidiary in the generation  marketing segment is agr as of december 31 2021 agr owns the 595 mw cardinal plant which is operated by a nonaffiliated electric cooperative other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to the ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act the ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and 

ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable the ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 the ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of agr and set costbased rates if the ferc subsequently determines that it can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions periodically agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to the ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies agr is also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc with the approval of the ferc 

competition 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation because agr’s remaining generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s generation  marketing segment agr also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of agr’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive 

this segment’s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and washington dc each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition sustained low natural gas and power prices low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business 

this segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under longterm contracts to creditworthy counterparties new sources are not acquired without first securing a longterm placement of such power existing sources do not face competitive exposure competitive nonaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the generation  marketing segment 



coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate its coalfired unit agr through its contracts with thirdparty transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facility agr plants consumed 12 million tons of coal in 2021 

the coal supplies at agr’s plant vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries agr aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plant in the range of 20 to 60 days of full load burn as of december 31 2021 the coal inventory of agr was within the target range 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2021 counterparties posted approximately 266 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately   113 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

as of december 31 2021 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 1435 mws of companyowned domestic wind power facilities and 148 mws of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements additional long term purchased power agreements have been entered into for 669 mws of wind and 1230 mws of solar capacity which are all seeking permits or under construction these agreements are all contingent on completion of construction which is expected by the end of 2024

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of regulated operations 

aep may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the construction of additional transmission and renewable generation facilities modernizing existing infrastructure installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives aep’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected aep subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments this would cause financial results to be diminished 

regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit aep’s ability to recover costs and other amounts applies to all registrants 

the rates customers pay to aep regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia in certain instances aep’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval aep cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the ferc or the respective state commissions in establishing rates 

if regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved see note 4 – rate matters included in the 2021 annual report for additional information 

aep’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy applies to all registrants 

a significant portion of aep’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if the ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected aep’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted management believes aep’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives aep an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp ercot or other rtos will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to aep 

certain elements of aep’s transmission formula rates have been challenged which could result in lowered rates andor refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on aep’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows applies to all registrants other than aep texas 

aep provides transmission service under rates regulated by the ferc the ferc has approved the costbased formula rate templates used by aep to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates all aspects of aep’s rates accepted or approved by the ferc including the formula rate templates the rates of return on the 

actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures are subject to challenge by interested parties at the ferc or by the ferc on its own initiative in addition interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by aep of its projected rates and formula rate trueup pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under aep’s formula rate implementation protocols if a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential then the ferc can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them andor disallow any of aep’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula 

inquiries related to rates of return as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities are ongoing in other proceedings at the ferc the results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact aep in any future challenges to aep’s formula rates if the ferc orders revenue reductions including refunds in any future cases related to its formula rates it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

enduse consumers and entities supplying electricity to enduse consumers may also attempt to influence government andor regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to aep particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially 

aep faces risks related to project siting financing construction permitting governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities applies to all registrants 

aep owns develops constructs manages and operates electric generation transmission and distribution facilities a key component of aeps growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities as part of these operations aep must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local state federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions should aep be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving thirdparty challenges to such licenses or permits should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with thirdparties could have similar results 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises applies to all registrants 

aep primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise this method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery these developments can challenge aep’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity 

aep may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other thirdparty suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects aep’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur in addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled 

aep is exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

im owns the cook plant which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2296 mws or about 7 of the generating capacity in the aep system aep and im are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

• the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incidentevent resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as snf 

• limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations 

• uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others 

• uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants in addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the cook plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require aep or im to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs the ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

aep subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control applies to all registrants 

results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various rtos including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues existing new or changed rules of these rtos could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design in addition these rtos may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights as members of these rtos aep’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks including the allocation among existing members of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets 

aep could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to all registrants 

owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject aep to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if aep were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards aep could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

a substantial portion of the receivables of aep texas is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows financial condition and results of operations applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from reps that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers as of december 31 2021 aep texas did business with approximately 123 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments aep texas depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable puct regulations significantly limit the extent to which aep texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and aep texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort in 2021 aep texas’ three largest reps accounted for 43 of its operating revenue any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments aep texas had received from such rep 

ohio house bill 6 hb 6 which provides for beneficial cost recovery for opco and for plants owned by ovec has come under public scrutiny applies to aep and opco 

in 2019 ohio adopted and implemented hb 6 which benefits opco by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts ovec’s coalfired generating units and energy efficiency measures aep and opco engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with hb 6 in july 2020 an investigation led by the us attorney’s office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of hb 

6 the outcome of the us attorney’s office investigation and its impact on hb 6 is not known if certain provisions of hb 6 were to be eliminated it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted to the extent that opco is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by hb 6 it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition in addition the impact of continued public scrutiny of hb 6 is not known and may have an adverse impact on aep and opco including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities customers and other stakeholders aep is a defendant in current litigation relating to hb6 and aep or opco may be involved in future litigation 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

aep’s financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic applies to all registrants 

the global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic is an evolving situation that has caused and could continue to lead to extended disruption of economic activity in aep’s markets covid19 could negatively affect aep’s ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets its ability to access capital markets and results of operations aep currently cannot estimate the potential impact to its financial position results of operations and cash flows caused by covid19 which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain at this time see item 2 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview for additional information on covid19 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if aep is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions applies to all registrants 

performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission andor distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

• operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes 

• operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements 

• labor disputes 

• compliance with mandatory reliability standards including mandatory cyber security standards 

• information technology failure that impairs aep’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations 

• information technology failure that affects aep’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects aep’s reputation or exposes aep to legal claims 

• supply chain disruptions and inflation 

• fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints adverse weather such as drought nonperformance by suppliers and other factors 

• catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes explosions hurricanes tornados ice storms terrorism including cyberterrorism floods or other similar occurrences 

• fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry 

physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage aep’s reputation applies to all registrants 

aep and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owneroperators of generation transmission andor distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading aep and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or aep operations could view these computer systems software or networks as targets for cyberattack in addition the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is 

subject to electronic theft or loss 

a security breach of aep or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems interconnected entities in rtos or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system aep and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with ransomware theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data a successful cyberattack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to aep’s reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring aep and its thirdparty vendors have been subject and will likely continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to their technology systems and confidential data or to attempts to disrupt utility and related business operations while there have been immaterial incidents of phishing unauthorized access to technology systems financial fraud and disruption of remote access across the aep system there has been no material impact on business or operations from these attacks however the aep cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches operational incidents or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure and cannot provide any assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future 

the rate of taxes imposed on aep could change applies to all registrants 

aep is subject to income taxation at the federal level and by certain states and municipalities in determining aep’s income tax liability for these jurisdictions management monitors changes to the applicable tax laws and related regulations while management believes it is in compliance with current prevailing laws one or more taxing jurisdictions could seek to impose incremental or new taxes on the company in addition the biden administration has proposed and congressional leaders have considered significant changes in tax law and regulations that could result in additional federal income taxes being imposed on aep any adverse developments in these laws or regulations including legislative changes judicial holdings or administrative interpretations could have a material and adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations 

if aep is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition applies to all registrants 

aep relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows or proceeds from the strategic sale of assets and investments including subsidiaries such as the planned sale of kpco and ktco and insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile volatility increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect aep’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies such as aep that rely on fossil fuels any planned sale of assets and investments including subsidiaries may not occur for any number of reasons beyond our control including regulatory approval on terms that are acceptable if sources of capital for aep are reduced andor expected sale proceeds do not become available capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital or insurance markets andor increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

shareholder activism could cause aep to incur significant expense hinder execution of aep’s business strategy and impact aep’s stock price applies to all registrants 

shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and aep’s board’s attention and resources from aep’s business additionally such 

shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to aep’s future adversely affect aep’s relationships with its employees customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also aep may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors aep’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism 

the announced phasing out of libor may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing applies to all registrants 

a portion of the registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars on november 30 2020 the federal reserve and the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom announced that libor would be phased out completely by june 20 2023 and replaced by the secured overnight financing rate sofr and certain libor maturities have already been phased out however because sofr is a broad us treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions it differs fundamentally from us dollar libor and the sofr market is not yet fully developed in addition the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor uncertainty as to the nature of such phaseout and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could cause interest rates to increase if sources of capital for the registrants are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition andor liquidity 

downgrades in aep’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital applies to all registrants 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review aep’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to aep and could limit access to funding for operations aep’s business is capital intensive and aep is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive if aep’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained aep’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep and aeptco have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries applies to aep and aeptco 

aep and aeptco are holding companies and have no operations of their own their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries primarily their regulated utilities and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from them their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep or aeptco to provide them with funds for their payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep or aeptco by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep and aeptco indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

aep’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions applies to all registrants 

electric power consumption is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition in addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause including international tariffs generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning applies to all registrants and to aep and im with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning 

the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets discount rates the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan changes in actuarial assumptions future government regulation changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of aep’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and aep could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations 

additionally im holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant the rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts 

supply chain disruptions and inflation could negatively impact our operations and corporate strategy applies to all registrants 

aep’s operations and business plans depend on the global supply chain to procure the equipment materials and other resources necessary to build and provide services in a safe and reliable manner the delivery of components materials equipment and other resources that are critical to our business operations and corporate strategy has been restricted by the current domestic and global supply chain upheaval this has resulted in the shortage of critical items these disruptions and shortages could adversely impact both our business operations and corporate strategy the constraints in the supply chain could restrict the availability and delay the construction maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support normal operations or are required to execute on our corporate strategy for continued capital investment in utility equipment these disruptions and constraints could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition 

supply chain disruptions have contributed to higher prices of components materials equipment and other needed commodities and these inflationary increases may continue in the future while inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years during 2021 the economy in the united states encountered a material level of inflation the impact of covid19 continues to increase uncertainty in the outlook of nearterm economic activity including whether inflation will continue and at what rate aep typically recovers increases in capital expenses from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover increased capital costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition increases in inflation raises our costs for labor materials and services and failure to secure these on reasonable terms may adversely impact our financial condition 

aep’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or decline in customer demand applies to all registrants 

growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of aep such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside 

management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity including changes due to public health considerations 

certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to further reduce energy consumption additionally technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption some or all of these factors could impact the demand for electricity 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations applies to all registrants 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements employee reaction to comply with potential covid19 vaccination or testing mandates mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include potential higher rates of existing employee departures lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs safety costs and costs of compliance with potential covid19 vaccination or testing mandates may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business if aep is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in the price of commodities the cost of procuring fuel emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase aep’s cost of producing power impacting financial performance applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel including the cost to procure coal and gas and the price and availability to transport fuel aep has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel but as these contracts end or if they are not honored aep may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts the inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life and while aep typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances there can be no assurance in the future that aep will recover such costs similarly aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances aep uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures based on current environmental programs remaining in effect aep has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if aep needs to obtain allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs aep’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past changes in the cost of fuel emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are markedtomarket they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change applies to all registrants 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events such as fires customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require aep to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of the aep service territory could also have an impact on revenues aep buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on aep’s own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as aep buys shortterm energy to serve aep’s own system which would increase the cost of energy aep provides to customers 

severe weather and weatherrelated events impact aep’s service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes fires floods and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase aep’s cost of providing service will increase including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts and these costs may not be recoverable changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact aep’s ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy aep may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact revenues aep’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies aep serves the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the aep system 

management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to aep’s business activities applies to all registrants 

aep is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2021 annual report adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

disruptions at power generation facilities owned by thirdparties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas transmits and distributes electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by thirdparties if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

management is unable to predict the course results or impact if any of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the extreme winter weather in texas in february 2021 applies to aep and aep texas 

as a result of the february 2021 severe winter weather in texas which caused a shortage of electric generation ercot instructed aep texas and other texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained largescale outage and prevent longterm damage to the electric system at its peak approximately 468000 44 aep texas customers were without power 

aep texas and other aep entities are named in approximately 100 lawsuits generally alleging the failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and updating their generation transmission and distribution facilities in order to prevent cold weather failures and other related negligence the complaints seek monetary damages among other forms of relief in february 2021 aep texas received a civil investigative demand from the office of the attorney general of texas requesting among other data information about its communications to and from ercot puct retail electric providers utilities or power generation companies concerning power outages related to the february 2021 winter storm the company responded to the civil investigative demand in march 2021 management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact if any on future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of aep’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties applies to all registrants 

aep operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime equipment interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks the hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties aep maintains property and casualty insurance but aep is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to aep’s business such as damage to poles towers and lines or losses caused by outages 

aeptco depends on its affiliates in the aep system for a substantial portion of its revenues applies to aeptco 

aeptco’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the aep system management expects that these affiliates will continue to be aeptco’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future for the year ended december 31 2021 its affiliates were responsible for approximately 79 of the consolidated transmission revenues of aeptco 

most of the real property rights on which the assets of aeptco are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates applies to aeptco 

aeptco does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located instead under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective aep system utility affiliate that overlay its operations the ability of aeptco to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates which may be encumbered by easements mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property aep can give no assurance that a the relevant aep system utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of aeptco b suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant aep system utility affiliates are not its affiliates and c the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit aeptco to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption 

compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements may lead to increased costs and result in penalties applies to all registrants 

business activities of electric utilities and related companies are heavily regulated primarily through national and state laws and regulations of general applicability including laws and regulations related to working conditions health and safety equal employment opportunity employee benefit and other labor and employment matters laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters many agencies employ mandatory civil penalty structures for regulatory violations registrants are subject to the jurisdiction of many federal and state agencies including the ferc nerc commodities futures trading commission federal epa nrc occupational safety and health administration the sec and the united states department of justice which may impose significant civil and criminal penalties to enforce compliance requirements relative to aep’s business which could have a material adverse effect on financial operating results including earnings cash flow and liquidity 

the impact of new laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted and changes in applicable laws regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase aep’s operating costs require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services aep offers or result in adverse publicity and harm aep’s reputation 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

costs of compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws are significant applies to all registrants except aeptco 

operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety a majority of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste including coalcombustion residuals or ccr resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements including any new and more stringent application of existing ccr regulations requires aep to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees disposal remediation and permits at aep facilities and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission limits ccr waste discharge andor discharge disposal obligations are tightened more extensive operating andor permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances or facilities become regulated although aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers there can be no assurance in the future that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions could materially increase costs to aep and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

to date federal court decisions have blocked federal epa’s attempts to regulate co 2 emissions from existing utility units while there are no federal co 2 regulations in effect at present the current administration has announced addressing climate change as a policy priority costs of compliance with the environmental regulation of co 2 emissions if any could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition andor could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life although aep typically recovers environmental expenditures there can be no assurance in the future that aep can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order aep to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions applies to all registrants except aep texas and aeptco 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which aep among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against aep substantial modifications or retirement of aep’s existing coalfired power plants could be required and aep might be required to purchase power from thirdparties to fulfill aep’s commitments to supply power to aep customers this could have a material impact on revenues in addition aep could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations unless recovered those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by aep resulting from the management of aep’s trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position 

aep’s power trading activities also expose aep to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that aep’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls aep would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

in connection with these trading activities aep routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options otc options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose aep to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner aep does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations 

parties with whom aep has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm aep’s results of operations applies to all registrants 

aep sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis aep also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances renewable energy credits and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations aep is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe aep money or the delivery of a commodity including power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform aep may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed aep’s contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and aep might incur losses although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

aep relies on electric transmission facilities that aep does not own or control if these facilities do not provide aep with adequate transmission capacity aep may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of aep’s power applies to all registrants 

aep depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power aep sells at wholesale this dependence exposes aep to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate aep may not be able to sell and deliver aep wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate aep’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if 

restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

ovec may require additional liquidity and other capital support applies to aep apco im and opco 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies own ovec the intercompany power agreement icpa defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it under the icpa parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 if a party fails to make payments owed by it under the icpa ovec may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness as of december 31 2021 ovec has outstanding indebtedness of approximately 11 billion of which apco im and opco are collectively responsible for 492 million through the icpa although they are not an obligor or guarantor apco im and opco are responsible for their respective ratio of ovec’s outstanding debt through the icpa and if ovec’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that apco im andor opco may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347

title to property 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the aep system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio tennessee texas virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines aep has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which aep’s operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission distribution generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 76 billion of construction expenditures for 2022 estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends supply chain issues weather legal reviews and the ability to access capital see the “budgeted capital expenditures” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2021 annual report for additional information

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

aep’s revolving credit agreement which backstops the commercial paper program includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test in addition the acceleration of aep’s payment obligations or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

operations for aep subsidiaries are subject to the cwa which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for water withdrawals at existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day a schedule for compliance with the standard is established by the permit agency and incorporated in npdes permits 

in november 2015 the federal epa issued a final rule revising effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating facilities the rule established limits on fgd wastewater fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed in npdes permits as soon as possible after november 2018 and no later than december 2023 the federal epa further revised the rule in august 2020 for fgd wastewater and bottom ash transport water extending the compliance date to december 2025 and establishing additional options in january 2020 the federal epa issued a final rule revising the scope of the “waters of the united states” subject to cwa regulation see “environmental issues  clean water act regulations” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

coal ash regulation 

aep’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion byproducts including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials a rule by the federal epa regulates the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close see “environmental issues  coal combustion residual rule” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting aep’s power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the caa includes a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants and requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls collectively called the acid rain program aep continues to meet its obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets 

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips see “environmental issues  clean air act requirements” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

hazardous air pollutants hap 

the caa also requires the federal epa to investigate hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submit a report to congress to determine whether those emissions should be regulated in 2011 the federal epa issued a rule setting maximum achievable control technology standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards for emissions from new and modified power plants in 2014 the us supreme court determined that the federal epa acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hap emissions from electric generating units the federal epa has engaged in additional rulemaking activity but the 2011 rule remains in effect see “environmental issues  mercury and other hazardous air pollutants regulation” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these protected areas in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso executed a settlement with the federal epa and the state of oklahoma to comply with regional haze program requirements in oklahoma and the settlement is now codified in the oklahoma sip and approved by the federal epa the federal epa disapproved portions of the arkansas and texas sips and finalized fips for both states arkansas submitted and received approval of a revised sip and the federal epa developed a revised fip for texas see “environmental issues  clean air act requirements” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

climate change 

aep has taken action to reduce and offset co 2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects co 2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities in 2021 aep announced revised intermediate and longterm co 2 emission reduction goals based on the output of the company’s integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand regulations grid reliability and resiliency and reflect the company’s current business strategy the intermediate goal is an 80 reduction from 2000 co 2 emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is netzero co 2 emissions from aep generating facilities by 2050 aep’s total estimated co 2 emissions in 2020 were approximately 44 million metric tons a 73 reduction from aep’s 2000 co 2 emissions aep will publish a new report in 2021 on the results of a climate change scenario analysis 

to date the federal epa has twice taken action to regulate co 2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the caa the clean power plan was adopted in october 2015 but the us supreme court issued a stay of its implementation including all of the deadlines for submission 

of initial or final state plans the clean power plan was repealed by the federal epa in 2019 and replaced by the affordable clean energy ace rule which changed the federal epa’s approach to regulating co 2 emissions from existing coalfired generating units in january 2021 the ace rule was vacated by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and remanded to the federal epa for further proceedings it is too soon to predict how the federal epa will respond to the court’s remand management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as aep diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals 

transforming aep’s generation fleet 

the electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation driven by changing customer needs policy demands demographics competitive offerings technologies and commodity prices aep is also transforming to be more agile and customerfocused as a valued provider of energy solutions aep’s longterm commitment to reduce co 2 emissions reflects the current direction of the company’s resource plans to meet those needs as well a new climate change scenario analysis to be published in 2021 aep’s exposure to carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years from 2000 to 2020 aep’s co 2 emissions declined 73 in 2020 coal represented 44 of aep’s generating capacity compared with 70 in 2005 management expects the percentage of aep’s generating resources fueled by coal will continue to decline and to represent only 24 of generating capacity by 2030 the longterm goal is netzero co 2 emissions from aep generating facilities by 2050 transforming aep’s generation portfolio to include where there is regulatory support more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient use of energy demand response distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid over time is part of this strategy 

the graph below summarizes aep’s generation capacity by resource type for the years 1999 2005 and 2020 

a energy efficiencydemand response represents avoided capacity rather than physical assets 

renewable sources of energy 

the states aep serves other than kentucky west virginia and tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources 

as of december 31 2020 aep’s regulated utilities had longterm contracts for 2750 mws of wind 80 mws of hydro and 10 mws of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers in addition im owns four solar projects that make up im’s 16 mw clean energy solar pilot project management actively manages aep’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

in 2020 pso received approval from the occ and swepco received approval from the apsc and lpsc to acquire the north central wind energy facilities comprised of three oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1485 mws on a fixed cost turnkey basis at completion both the apsc and lpsc approved the flexup option agreeing to acquire the texas portion which the puct denied pso will own 455 and swepco will own 545 of the project which will cost approximately 2 billion 

in may 2020 the irs issued a notice extending the “continuity safe harbor” deadlines for qualifying renewable energy projects that began construction in 2016 and 2017 by one year as many projects are facing supply chain and other project development delays caused by covid19 under the may 2020 irs notice qualifying renewable energy projects that began construction in 2016 and 2017 and which are placed inservice by the end of 2021 and 2022 respectively will satisfy the continuity safe harbor provided that each facility does satisfy the continuity safe harbor under the current irs guidance the 199 mw wind facility will qualify for 100 of the federal ptc and the remaining two wind facilities totaling 1286 mws will qualify for 80 of the federal ptc 

having regulatory approval and the expectation that all three wind facilities will be eligible for the irs extension of the “continuity safe harbor” pso and swepco are proceeding with the full 1485 mw development of these three projects the 199 mw wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed inservice in march 2021 the 287 mw wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed inservice in december 2021 and the 999 mw wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed inservice between december 2021 and april 2022 

the growth of aep’s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs in addition to gradually reducing aep’s reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps aep to maintain a diversity of generation resources 

the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by aep’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect aep’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world aep has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources transmission assets of the aep system interconnect approximately 16300 mws of renewable energy resources aep’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources 

aep energy supply llc is a holding company with several divisions including aep renewables and aep onsite partners 

aep renewables develops owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the united states aep renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals as of december 31 2020 aep renewables owned projects operating in 11 states including approximately 1307 mws of installed wind capacity and 90 mws of installed solar capacity these figures include the 2020 acquisition of an additional 10 interest or approximately 30 mws of santa rita east wind generation located in west texas in october 2019 aep renewables entered into an agreement to construct flat ridge 3 a wind farm in kansas the 128 mw facility is expected to reach commercial operation by may 2021

end use energy efficiency 

aep has reduced energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly referred to as demandside management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available aep’s operating companies’ programs have reduced annual consumption by over 9 million mwhs and peak demand by approximately 2900 mws since 2008 aep estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 15 billion during that period to achieve these levels 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states aep serves appropriate cost recovery will be essential for aep operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments as aep continues to transition to a cleaner more efficient energy future energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers aep believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a costeffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of aep’s strategic plan the board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets the board of directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would significantly affect aep the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees aep’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about aep’s environmental social governance and financial performance aep set co 2 emission reduction goals in 2018 after considering input from corporate governance outreach effort with shareholders 

in february 2021 aep announced new intermediate and longterm co 2 emission reduction goals based on the output of the company’s integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand grid reliability and resiliency regulations and the company’s current business strategy the intermediate goal is an 80 

reduction from 2000 co 2 emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is netzero co 2 emissions from aep generating facilities by 2050 aep has made significant progress in reducing co 2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline technological advances including advanced energy storage modular nuclear and green hydrogen and public policies are among the factors that will determine how quickly aep can achieve netzero emissions while continuing to provide reliable affordable power for customers aep will publish a new report in 2021 on the results of a climate change scenario analysis 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see “the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation” section of note 6 included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2018 2019 and 2020 and the current estimate for 2021 are shown below these investments include both environmental as well as other related spending estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital in addition to the amounts set forth below aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants’ facilities for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2020 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more stringent the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system aep typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition see “environmental issues” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2020 annual report for additional information

business segments 

aep’s reportable segments 

aep’s primary business is the generation transmission and distribution of electricity within its vertically integrated utilities segment aep centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of costbased rates and regulatory oversight intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements aep’s reportable segments are as follows 

• vertically integrated utilities 

• transmission and distribution utilities 

• aep transmission holdco 

• generation  marketing 

the remainder of aep’s activities is presented as corporate and other which is not considered a reportable segment see note 9  business segments included in the 2020 annual report for additional information on aep’s segments 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2020 aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 22000 mws of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type including wind purchase agreements on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources or retirement of traditional fossil fuel units may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2020 fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities decreased 3 on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2019 

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers marketers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2020 decreased approximately 27 from 2019 mainly due to lower dispatching of coal generation from weaker power market prices 

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls 3016 railcars 411 barges 6 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in aep generating facilities 

spot market prices for coal weakened during the first half of 2020 before stabilizing or slightly rebounding in the second half of 2020 the decreased spot coal prices reflect lower demand for domestic and export coal aep’s strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods and can occasionally cause current spot market prices to be trending opposite to the price of coal delivered the price paid for coal delivered in 2020 increased approximately 18 from 2019 mainly due to lignite mine related activities and closure costs 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal and lignite purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2020 the vertically integrated utilities’ coal inventory was approximately 64 days of full load burn while inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the vertically integrated utilities is approximately 30 days of full load burn 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed approximately 113 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2020 for generating power this represents a decrease of 333 from 2019 several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate aep’s natural gas supply transactions are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of snf im completed modifications to its snf storage pool in the early 1990’s im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of snf to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis the year of expiration of each nrc operating license is 2034 for unit 1 and 2037 for unit 2 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of snf and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the snf disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2018 the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant was 2 billion in 2018 nondiscounted dollars with additional ongoing estimated costs of 6 million per year for post decommissioning storage of snf and an eventual estimated cost of 37 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility also in 2018 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 3 billion and 27 

billion respectively the balance of funds available to eventually decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

• escalation of various cost elements including but not limited to general inflation and the cost of energy 

• further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning 

• technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies 

• availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities 

• availability of a united states department of energy facility for permanent storage of snf 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections aep will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections see the “nuclear contingencies” section of note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2020 annual report for additional information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed lowlevel radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of lowlevel radioactive waste in the event that lowlevel radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable it can be stored onsite at this facility 

counterparty risk management 

the vertically integrated utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants as a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2020 counterparties posted approximately 13 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   19 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

im 

the upa between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 the im power agreement provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the im power agreement will continue in effect until the debt obligations of aegco secured by the rockport plant have been satisfied and discharged currently expected to be december 2028 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a upa between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the upa between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco upa expires in december 2022 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 parent owns 3917 and opco owns 43 under the intercompany power agreement icpa which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the icpa terminates in june 2040 the proceeds from charges by ovec to sponsoring companies under the icpa based on their power participation ratios are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs ovec’s board of directors as elected by aep and nonaffiliated owners has authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests with resulting expenses including for related debt and interest thereon included in charges under the icpa ovec financed capital expenditures totaling 13 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances both ovec generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls inservice see note 17  variable interest entities and equity method investments for additional information 

electric delivery 

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with pjm and spp and as approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – competition 

transmission agreement 

apco im kgpco kpco and wpco own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the pjm oatt and are parties to the ta opco which is a subsidiary in aep’s transmission and distribution utilities segment that provides transmission service under the pjm oatt is also a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by pjm the ta has been approved by the ferc

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of much of the energy policy act of 2005 which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s costofservice generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed inservice provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4  rate matters included in the 2020 annual report for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fac in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a combined costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through the enec which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and aep has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers in addition the ferc regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees additionally the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the nerc with the approval of the ferc 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of aep’s public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

competition 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they currently maintain a competitive position 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aep texas and opco opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1507000 retail customers in ohio opco purchases energy and capacity to serve standard service offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load aep texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1068000 retail customers through reps in west central and southern texas

opco provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at costbased rates approved by the puco or by the ferc aep texas provides transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules transmission and distribution rates are established on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service the costofservice generally reflects operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment 

ferc 

the ferc regulates rates for transmission of electric power accounting and other matters the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and it has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books 

and records of any company within a holding company system additionally the transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards as set forth by the nerc with the approval of the ferc 

seasonality 

the delivery of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s transmission and distribution facilities in addition aep transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder in texas and to a lesser extent in ohio where there is residential decoupling unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

aep transmission holdco 

general 

aepthco is a holding company for a aeptco which is the direct holding company for the state transcos and b aep’s transmission joint ventures 

aeptco 

aeptco wholly owns the state transcos which are independent of but respectively overlay the following aep electric utility operating companies apco im kpco opco pso swepco and wpco the state transcos develop own operate and maintain their respective transmission assets assets of the state transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and nonaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of pjm miso and spp aptco imtco ktco ohtco and wvtco are located within pjm imtco also owns portions of the greentown station assets located in miso oktco and swtco are located within spp 

imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions the virginia scc and wvpsc granted consent for apco and aptco to enter into a joint license agreement that will support aptco investment in the state of tennessee swtco does not currently own or operate transmission assets 

the state transcos are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the ferc and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems the state transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with the ferc the rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed roe these rates are then included in an oatt for pjm miso and spp 

the state transcos own operate maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability grid security safety reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets a key part of aep’s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities assets and components of the existing aep system as needed to maintain reliability 

the state transcos provide the capability to build replace and upgrade existing facilities as of december 31 2020 the state transcos had 99 billion of transmission and other assets inservice with plans to construct approximately 42 billion of additional transmission assets through 2023 additional investment in transmission infrastructure is needed within pjm and spp to maintain the required level of grid reliability resiliency security and efficiency and to address an aging transmission infrastructure additional transmission facilities will be needed based on changes in generating resources such as wind or solar projects generation additions or retirements and additional new customer interconnections the state transcos will continue their investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid 

aepthco joint venture initiatives 

aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america transmission joint ventures

regulation 

the state transcos and the transmission joint ventures located outside of ercot establish transmission rates annually through forwardlooking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to fercapproved implementation protocols the protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudentlyincurred and reasonably calculated the imtcoowned greentown station assets acquired from duke energy indiana llc in december 2018 are located in miso imtco utilizes a historic cost recovery model to recover miso assets 

the state transcos’ and the transmission joint ventures’ where applicable rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system the ferc requires transmission providers such as pjm and spp to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis 

the fercapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement atrr and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the ferc the formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous year’s billings allowing for overunderrecovery of the transmission owner’s atrr pjm and spp pay the transmission owners their atrr for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatt for the service taken additionally the state transcos are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the nerc with the approval of the ferc 

management continues to monitor the ferc’s 2019 notice of inquiry regarding base roe policy the ferc’s 2020 notice of proposed rulemaking regarding transmission incentives policy and various other matters pending before the ferc with the potential to affect the transmission roe methodology 

in the second quarter of 2019 the ferc approved settlement agreements establishing base roes of 985 1035 inclusive of rto incentive adder of 05 and 10 105 inclusive of rto incentive adder of 05 for aep’s pjm and spp transmissionowning subsidiaries respectively in the second quarter of 2020 ferc order 569a determined the base roe for miso’s transmission owning members including aep’s miso transmissionowning subsidiaries should be 1002 1052 inclusive of the rto incentive adder of 05 

if the ferc makes any changes to its roe and incentive policies they would be applied as applicable to aep’s pjm spp and miso transmission owning subsidiaries on a prospective basis and could affect future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

in the annual rate base filings described above the state transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of 70 billion 59 billion and 46 billion for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the total filed transmission revenue requirements including prior year overunderrecovery of revenue and associated carrying charges were 12 billion 992 million and 829 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the rates of ett which is located in ercot are determined by the puct ett sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim transmission cost of services tcos filings ett may file interim tcos filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital 

the transmission joint ventures have approved roes ranging from 96 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 

generation  marketing 

general 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of a wholesale energy trading and marketing business a retail supply and energy management business and competitive generating assets 

aep energy supply llc is a holding company with several divisions including aep renewables and aep onsite partners 

aep renewables develops owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the united states aep renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals as of december 31 2020 aep renewables owned projects operating in 11 states including approximately 1307 mws of installed wind capacity and 90 mws of installed solar capacity in october 2019 aep renewables entered into an agreement to construct flat ridge 3 a wind farm in kansas the 128 mw facility is expected to reach commercial operation by may 2021 in november 2020 aep renewables signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire 75 of the dry lake solar project a 100 mw solar facility in southern nevada this facility is expected to be inservice in the second quarter of 2021 

aep onsite partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities aep onsite partners targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers as of december 31 2020 aep onsite partners owned projects located in 21 states including approximately 152 mws of installed solar capacity and approximately 9 mws of solar projects under construction 

with respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries enter into shortterm and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ercot spp miso and pjm these subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities these activities primarily involve the purchaseandsale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent otc swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to the retail supply and energy management business aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity andor natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides various energy solutions in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy had approximately 510000 customer accounts as of december 31 2020 

the primary fossil generation subsidiary in the generation  marketing segment is agr as of december 31 2020 agr owns 643 mws of generating capacity almost all of which is operated by buckeye power a nonaffiliated electric cooperative other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets  see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to the ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act the ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable the ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 the ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the 

marketbased rates of agr and set costbased rates if the ferc subsequently determines that it can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions periodically agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to the ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies agr is also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc with the approval of the ferc 

competition 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation because most of agr’s remaining generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s generation  marketing segment agr also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of agr’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive 

this segment’s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and washington dc each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition sustained low natural gas and power prices low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business 

this segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under longterm contracts to creditworthy counterparties new sources are not acquired without first securing a longterm placement of such power existing sources do not face competitive exposure competitive nonaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the generation  marketing segment not including aep energy partners’ offtake agreement from the oklaunion power station which was retired in september 2020 



coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate its coalfired unit agr through its contracts with thirdparty transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facility agr plants consumed 16 million tons of coal in 2020 

the coal supplies at agr’s plant vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries agr aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plant in the range of 20 to 60 days of full load burn as of december 31 2020 the coal inventory of agr was within the target range 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2020 counterparties posted approximately 29 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately   122 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

as of december 31 2020 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 1307 mws of companyowned domestic wind power facilities and 101 mws of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements additional long term purchased power agreements have been entered into for 712 mws of wind and 200 mws of solar capacity which are all under construction these agreements are all contingent on completion of construction which is expected by the end of 2022 an agreement which transferred 355 mws of coalfired capacity from the oklaunion power station to this segment was terminated upon the closure of the facility in october

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of regulated operations 

aep may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives aep’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected aep subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments this would cause financial results to be diminished 

regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit aep’s ability to recover costs and other amounts applies to all registrants 

the rates customers pay to aep regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia in certain instances aep’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval aep cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the ferc or the respective state commissions in establishing rates 

if regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved see note 4 – rate matters included in the 2020 annual report for additional information 

aep’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy applies to all registrants 

a significant portion of aep’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if the ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected aep’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted management believes aep’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives aep an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp ercot or other rtos will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to aep 

certain elements of aep’s transmission formula rates have been challenged which could result in lowered rates andor refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on aep’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows applies to all registrants other than aep texas 

aep provides transmission service under rates regulated by the ferc the ferc has approved the costbased formula rate templates used by aep to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates all aspects of aep’s rates accepted or approved by the ferc including the formula rate templates the rates of return on the 

actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures are subject to challenge by interested parties at the ferc or by the ferc on its own initiative in addition interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by aep of its projected rates and formula rate trueup pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under aep’s formula rate implementation protocols if a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential then the ferc can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them andor disallow any of aep’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula 

aep settled challenges to its spp and pjm formula rates in proceedings at the ferc in 2019 however inquiries related to rates of return as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities are ongoing in other proceedings at the ferc the results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact aep in any future challenges to aep’s formula rates if the ferc orders revenue reductions including refunds in any future cases related to its formula rates it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

enduse consumers and entities supplying electricity to enduse consumers may also attempt to influence government andor regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to aep particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially 

aep faces risks related to project siting financing construction permitting governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities applies to all registrants 

aep owns develops constructs manages and operates electric generation transmission and distribution facilities a key component of aeps growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities as part of these operations aep must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local state federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions should aep be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving thirdparty challenges to such licenses or permits should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with thirdparties could have similar results 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises applies to all registrants 

aep primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise this method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery these developments can challenge aep’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity 

aep may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other thirdparty suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects aep’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur in addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled 

aep is exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

im owns the cook plant which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2288 mws or about 7 of the generating capacity in the aep system aep and im are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

• the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incidentevent resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as snf 

• limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations 

• uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others 

• uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants in addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the cook plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require aep or im to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs the ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

aep subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control applies to all registrants 

results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various rtos including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues existing new or changed rules of these rtos could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design in addition these rtos may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights as members of these rtos aep’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks including the allocation among existing members of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets 

aep could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to all registrants 

owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject aep to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if aep were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards aep could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

a substantial portion of the receivables of aep texas is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows financial condition and results of operations applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from reps that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers as of december 31 2020 aep texas did business with approximately 122 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments aep texas depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable puct regulations significantly limit the extent to which aep texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and aep texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort in 2020 aep texas’ three largest reps accounted for 46 of its operating revenue any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments aep texas had received from such rep 

ohio house bill 6 hb 6 which provides for beneficial cost recovery for opco and for plants owned by ovec has come under public scrutiny applies to aep and opco 

in 2019 ohio adopted and implemented hb 6 which benefits opco by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts ovec’s coalfired generating units and energy efficiency measures aep and opco engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with hb 6 in july 2020 an investigation led by the us attorney’s office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of hb 

6 the outcome of the us attorney’s office investigation and its impact on hb 6 is not known if the provisions of hb 6 were to be eliminated it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted to the extent that opco is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by hb 6 it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition in addition the impact of continued public scrutiny of hb 6 is not known and may have an adverse impact on aep and opco including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities customers and other stakeholders aep is a defendant in current litigation relating to hb6 and aep or opco may be involved in future litigation 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

aep’s financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic applies to all registrants 

the global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic is an evolving situation that could lead to extended disruption of economic activity in aep’s markets covid19 could negatively affect aep’s ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets its ability to access capital markets and results of operations aep currently cannot estimate the potential impact to its financial position results of operations and cash flows caused by covid19 which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain at this time see item 2 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview for additional information on covid19 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if aep is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions applies to all registrants 

performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission andor distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

• operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes 

• operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements 

• labor disputes 

• compliance with mandatory reliability standards including mandatory cyber security standards 

• information technology failure that impairs aep’s information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations 

• information technology failure that affects aep’s ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects aep’s reputation or exposes aep to legal claims 

• fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints adverse weather such as drought nonperformance by suppliers and other factors 

• catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes explosions hurricanes tornados ice storms terrorism including cyberterrorism floods or other similar occurrences 

• fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry 

physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage aep’s reputation applies to all registrants 

aep and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owneroperators of generation transmission andor distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading aep and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or aep operations could view these computer systems software or networks as targets for cyberattack in addition the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

a security breach of aep or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems interconnected entities in rtos or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system aep and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data a successful cyberattack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to aep’s reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

if aep is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition applies to all registrants 

aep relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows aep also relies on access to insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile volatility increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect aep’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies such as aep that rely on fossil fuels if sources of capital for aep are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital or insurance markets andor increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

shareholder activism could cause aep to incur significant expense hinder execution of aep’s business strategy and impact aep’s stock price applies to all registrants 

shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and aep’s board’s attention and resources from aep’s business additionally such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to aep’s future adversely affect aep’s relationships with its employees customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also aep may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors aep’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism 

the announced phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing applies to all registrants 

a portion of the registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 subsequently on november 30 2020 the federal reserve and the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom announced that libor would be phased out completely by june 20 2023 and replaced by the secured overnight financing rate sofr while this announcement extends the transition period to june 2023 the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new us dollar libor issuances by the end of 2021 however because sofr is a broad us treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions it differs fundamentally from us dollar libor in addition the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor uncertainty as to the nature of such phaseout and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could cause interest rates to increase if sources of capital for the registrants are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition andor liquidity 

downgrades in aep’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital applies to all registrants 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review aep’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to aep and could limit access to funding for operations aep’s business is capital intensive and aep is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive if aep’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained aep’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep and aeptco have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries applies to aep and aeptco 

aep and aeptco are holding companies and have no operations of their own their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries primarily their regulated utilities and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from them their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep or aeptco to provide them with funds for their payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep or aeptco by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep and aeptco indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

aep’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions applies to all registrants 

electric power consumption is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition in addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause including international tariffs generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning applies to all registrants and to aep and im with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning 

the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets discount rates the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan changes in actuarial assumptions future government regulation changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of aep’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and aep could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations 

additionally im holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant the rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts 

aep’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or decline in customer demand applies to all registrants 

growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of aep such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity 

certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to further reduce energy consumption additionally technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption some or all of these factors could impact the demand for electricity 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations applies to all registrants 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business if aep is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in the price of commodities the cost of procuring fuel emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase aep’s cost of producing power impacting financial performance applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel including the cost to procure coal and gas and the price and availability to transport fuel aep has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel but as these contracts end or if they are not honored aep may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts the inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life and while aep typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances there can be no assurance in the future that aep will recover such costs similarly aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances aep uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures based on current environmental programs remaining in effect aep has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa attempts to further reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if aep needs to obtain allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs aep’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past changes in the cost of fuel emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are markedtomarket they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change applies to all registrants 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events such as fires customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require aep to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of the aep service territory could also have an impact on revenues aep buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on aep’s own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as aep buys shortterm energy to serve aep’s own system which would increase the cost of energy aep provides to customers 

severe weather and weatherrelated events impact aep’s service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes fires floods and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase aep’s cost of providing service will increase including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts and these costs may not be recoverable changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact aep’s ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy aep may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact revenues aep’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies aep serves the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the aep system 

management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to aep’s business activities applies to all registrants 

aep is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2020 annual report adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

disruptions at power generation facilities owned by thirdparties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas transmits and distributes electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by thirdparties if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

management is unable to predict the course results or impact if any of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the extreme winter weather in texas in february 2021 applies to aep and aep texas 

as a result of the february 2021 severe winter weather in texas which caused a shortage of electric generation ercot instructed aep texas and other texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained largescale outage and prevent longterm damage to the electric system at its peak approximately 468000 44 aep texas customers were without power 

in february 2021 a lawsuit was filed in nueces texas county court against aep and aep texas alleging the failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and updating its generation transmission and distribution facilities in order to prevent cold weather failures and other related negligence the complaint seeks monetary damages among other forms of relief 

in february 2021 aep texas received a civil investigative demand from the office of the attorney general of texas requesting among other data information about its communications to and from ercot puct retail electric providers utilities or power generation companies concerning power outages related to the february 2021 winter storm the company intends to respond to the civil investigative demand 

management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact if any on future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of aep’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties applies to all registrants 

aep operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime equipment interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks the hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties aep maintains property and casualty insurance but aep is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to aep’s business such as damage to poles towers and lines or losses caused by outages 

aeptco depends on its affiliates in the aep system for a substantial portion of its revenues applies to aeptco 

aeptco’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the aep system management expects that these affiliates will continue to be aeptco’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future for the year ended december 31 2020 its affiliates were responsible for approximately 78 of the consolidated transmission revenues of aeptco 

most of the real property rights on which the assets of aeptco are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates applies to aeptco 

aeptco does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located instead under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective aep system utility affiliate that overlay its operations the ability of aeptco to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates which may be encumbered by easements mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property aep can give no assurance that a the 

relevant aep system utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of aeptco b suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant aep system utility affiliates are not its affiliates and c the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit aeptco to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety a majority of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste including coalcombustion residuals or ccr resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires aep to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees disposal and permits at aep facilities and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission ccr waste andor discharge obligations are tightened more extensive operating andor permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated although aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers there can be no assurance in the future that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions could materially increase costs to aep and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in 2014 the federal epa issued standards for new modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development of sips that would reduce carbon co 2 emissions from existing utility units the clean power plan in 2019 the federal epa repealed the clean power plan and replaced it with new guidelines called the affordable clean energy ace rule in january 2021 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the ace rule and remanded it to the federal epa the new administration has announced addressing climate change as a policy priority costs of compliance with the environmental regulation of co 2 emissions if any could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition andor could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life although aep typically recovers environmental expenditures there can be no assurance in the future that aep can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order aep to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which aep among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against aep substantial modifications or retirement of aep’s existing coalfired power plants could be required and aep might be required to purchase power from thirdparties to fulfill aep’s commitments to supply power to aep customers this could have a material impact on revenues in addition aep could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations unless recovered those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by aep resulting from the management of aep’s trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position 

aep’s power trading activities also expose aep to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that aep’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls aep would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

in connection with these trading activities aep routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options otc options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose aep to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner aep does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations 

parties with whom aep has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm aep’s results of operations applies to all registrants 

aep sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis aep also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations aep is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe aep money or the delivery of a commodity including power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform aep may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed aep’s contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and aep might incur losses although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

aep relies on electric transmission facilities that aep does not own or control if these facilities do not provide aep with adequate transmission capacity aep may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of aep’s power applies to all registrants 

aep depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power aep sells at wholesale this dependence exposes aep to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate aep may not be able to sell and deliver aep wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate aep’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

ovec may require additional liquidity and other capital support applies to aep apco im and opco 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies including energy harbor formerly firstenergy solutions a nonaffiliated party own ovec the intercompany power agreement icpa defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it under the icpa parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 if a party fails to make payments owed by it under the icpa ovec may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness as of december 31 2020 ovec has outstanding indebtedness of approximately 13 billion of which apco im and opco are collectively responsible for 555 million through the icpa although they are not an obligor or guarantor apco im and opco are responsible for their respective ratio of ovec’s outstanding debt through the icpa 

the aggregate power participation ratio of energy harbor under the icpa is 485 a portion of energy harbor’s revenues includes amounts authorized under hb 6 the puco has rescinded its prior authorization of certain hb 6 related recovery for eligible entities including energy harbor if these amounts are not collected or if hb 6 is repealed and not replaced energy harbor’s financial ability to participate in the icpa could be adversely impacted management is currently unable to predict the outcome of the issues related to hb 6 and will continue to monitor the regulatory and legislative process and any potential impact to ovec’s cash flows or financial condition if ovec does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations there is risk that apco im andor opco may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments further if ovec’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that apco im andor opco may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347

title to property 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the aep system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio tennessee texas virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines aep has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which aep’s operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission distribution generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 75 billion of construction expenditures for 2021 estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather legal reviews and the ability to access capital see the “budgeted capital expenditures” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2020 annual report for additional information

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

aep’s revolving credit agreement which backstops the commercial paper program includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test in addition the acceleration of aep’s payment obligations or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under the credit agreement as of december 31 2019  aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

operations for aep subsidiaries are subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for water withdrawals at existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule 

in november 2015 the federal epa issued a final rule revising effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating facilities the rule establishes limits on flue gas desulfurization wastewater fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed as soon as possible after november 2018 and no later than december 2023 in january 2020 the federal epa issued a final rule revising the scope of the “waters of the united states” subject to clean water act regulation see “environmental issues  clean water act regulations” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

coal ash regulation 

aep’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion byproducts including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials a federal epa rule regulates the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close see “environmental issues  coal combustion residual rule” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting aep’s power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the caa includes a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants and requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls collectively called the acid rain program aep continues to meet its obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets 

national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips see “environmental issues  clean air act requirements” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

hazardous air pollutants hap 

the caa also requires the federal epa to investigate hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submit a report to congress to determine whether those emissions should be regulated in 2011 the federal epa issued a rule setting maximum achievable control technology standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards for emissions from new and modified power plants in 2014 the us supreme court determined that the federal epa acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hap emissions from electric generating units the federal epa has engaged in additional rulemaking activity but the 2011 rule remains in effect see “environmental issues  hazardous air pollutants” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these protected areas in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso executed a settlement with the federal epa and the state of oklahoma to comply with regional haze program requirements in oklahoma and the settlement is now codified in the oklahoma sip and approved by the federal epa the federal epa disapproved portions of the arkansas and texas sips and finalized fips for both states arkansas submitted and received approval of a revised sip and epa developed a revised fip for texas see “environmental issues  clean air act requirements” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

climate change 

aep has taken action to reduce and offset co 2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects co 2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities in 2019 aep announced revised intermediate and longterm co 2 emission reduction goals based on the output of the company’s integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand regulations grid reliability and resiliency and reflect the company’s current business strategy the intermediate goal is a 70 reduction from 2000 co 2 emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is an 80 or more reduction of co 2 emissions from aep generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050 aep’s total estimated co 2 emissions in 2019 were approximately 58 million metric tons a 65 reduction from aep’s 2000 co 2 emissions 

the federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the caa the clean power plan was adopted in october 2015 but the us supreme court issued a stay of its implementation including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans the federal epa issued a proposal in 2017 to repeal the clean power plan and finalized the repeal in 2019 in 2018 the federal epa issued a proposal to revise the standards for new and modified sources in 2019 the federal epa finalized new guidelines for states to use to develop co 2 performance standards for coal–fired generating units see “environmental issues  climate change co 2 regulation and energy policy” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as aep diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals 

transforming aep’s generation fleet 

the electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation driven by changing customer needs policy demands demographics competitive offerings technologies and commodity prices aep is also transforming to be more agile and customerfocused as a valued provider of energy solutions aep’s longterm commitment to reduce co 2 emissions reflects the current direction of the company’s resource plans to meet those needs aep’s exposure to carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years from 2000 to 2019 aep’s co 2 emissions declined 65 in 2019 coal represented 45 of aep’s generating capacity compared with 70 in 2005 management expects the percentage of aep’s generating resources fueled by coal will continue to decline transforming aep’s generation portfolio to include where there is regulatory support more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient use of energy demand response distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid over time is part of this strategy 

the graph below summarizes aep’s generation capacity by resource type for the years 1999 2005 and 2019 



renewable sources of energy 

the states aep serves other than kentucky west virginia and tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources 

as of december 31 2019  aep’s regulated utilities had longterm contracts for 2750 mws of wind 80 mws of hydro and 10 mws of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers in addition im owns four solar projects that make up im’s 16 mw clean energy solar pilot project management actively manages aep’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

in july 2019 pso and swepco submitted filings before their respective commissions for approval to acquire the north central wind energy facilities comprised of three oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1485 mws on a fixed cost turnkey basis at completion subject to regulatory approval pso will own 455 and swepco will own 545 of the project which will cost approximately 2 billion two wind facilities totaling 1286 mws would qualify for 80 of the federal production tax credits ptcs with yearend 2021 inservice dates the third wind facility 199 mws would qualify for 100 of the ptcs with a yearend 2020 inservice date the acquisition can be scaled subject to commercial limitation to align with individual state resource needs and approvals in december 2019 pso reached a joint stipulation and settlement agreement with the occ oklahoma attorney general’s office and customer groups in january 2020 swepco reached a joint settlement agreement with the apsc arkansas attorney general’s office and walmart inc hearings are scheduled for the first quarter of 2020 pso and swepco are seeking regulatory approvals by july 2020 

the growth of aep’s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs in addition to gradually reducing aep’s reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps aep to maintain a diversity of generation resources 

the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by aep’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect aep’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world aep has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources transmission assets of the aep system interconnect approximately 11900 mws of renewable energy resources aep’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources 

aep energy supply llc is a holding company with several divisions including aep renewables and aep onsite partners 

aep renewables develops owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the united states aep renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals as of december 31 2019 aep renewables owned projects operating in 11 states including approximately 1212 mws of installed wind capacity and 90 mws of installed solar capacity these figures include the 2019 addition of 724 mws of wind generation and battery assets located in several states acquired from sempra renewables llc and the 75 interest or 227 mws of santa rita east wind generation located in west texas in october 2019 aep renewables entered into an agreement to construct flat ridge 3 a wind farm in kansas the 128 mw facility is expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2020

competitive renewable generation facilities 



 

end use energy efficiency 

aep has reduced energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available aep’s operating companies’ programs have reduced annual consumption by over 9 million mwhs and peak demand by approximately 2806 mws since 2008 aep estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 15 billion during that period to achieve these levels 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states aep serves appropriate cost recovery will be essential for aep operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments as aep continues to transition to a cleaner more efficient energy future energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers aep believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a costeffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of aep’s strategic plan the board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets the board of directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would significantly affect aep the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees aep’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about aep’s environmental social governance and financial performance aep set co 2 emission reduction goals in 2018 after considering input from corporate governance outreach effort with shareholders 

in september 2019 aep announced new intermediate and longterm co 2 emission reduction goals based on the output of the company’s integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand grid reliability and resiliency regulations and the company’s current business strategy the intermediate goal is a 70 reduction from 2000 co 2 emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is to surpass an 80 reduction of co 2 emissions from aep generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050 aep has made significant progress in reducing co 2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline aep’s aspirational emissions goal is zero co 2 emissions by 2050 technological advances including energy storage will determine how quickly aep can achieve zero emissions while continuing to provide reliable affordable power for customers 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see “the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation” section of note 6 included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2017  2018 and 2019 and the current estimate for 2020 are shown below these investments include both environmental as well as other related spending estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital in addition to the amounts set forth below aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants’ facilities for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2019 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more stringent the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system aep typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition see “environmental issues” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 



 

management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals the following cost estimates for the years 2020 through 2026 will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the federal epa provides flexibility in the final rules these cost estimates will also change based on a the states’ implementation of these regulatory programs including the potential for sips or fips that impose more stringent standards b additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions c the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units d changes in costs for new pollution controls e new generating technology developments f total mws of capacity retired replaced or sold including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and g other factors management’s current ranges of estimates of new major environmental investments beginning in 2020  exclusive of debt afudc are set forth below 



business segments 

aep’s reportable segments 

aep’s primary business is the generation transmission and distribution of electricity within its vertically integrated utilities segment aep centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of costbased rates and regulatory oversight intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements aep’s reportable segments are as follows 

 

the remainder of aep’s activities is presented as corporate and other which is not considered a reportable segment see note 9  business segments included in the 2019 annual report for additional information on aep’s segments 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2019  aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 22000 mws of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type including wind purchase agreements on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2019 fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities increased 24 on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2018  

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers marketers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2019 decreased approximately 18 from 2018 mainly due to lower dispatching of coal generation from weaker power market prices 

  

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 4004 railcars 468 barges 8 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in aep generating facilities 

spot market prices for coal started to weaken in the second half of 2019  the decreased spot coal prices reflect lower demand for domestic and export coal aep’s strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods and can occasionally cause current spot market prices to be trending opposite to the price of coal delivered the price paid for coal delivered in 2019 increased approximately 6 from 2018  

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2019  the vertically integrated utilities’ coal inventory was approximately 54 days of full load burn while inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the vertically integrated utilities is approximately 30 days of full load burn 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed approximately 117 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2019 for generating power this represents an increase of 5 from 2018  total gas consumption for the vertically integrated utilities was higher year over year primarily due to lower natural gas prices several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas 

requirements for each plant as appropriate aep’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of snf im completed modifications to its snf storage pool in the early 1990’s im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of snf to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of snf and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the snf disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2018 the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant was 2 billion in 2018 nondiscounted dollars with additional ongoing estimated costs of 6 million per year for post decommissioning storage of snf and an eventual estimated cost of 37 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility also in 2018 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 27 billion and 22 billion respectively the balance of funds available to eventually decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections aep will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections see the “nuclear contingencies” section of note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2019 annual report for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable it can be stored onsite at this facility 

counterparty risk management 

the vertically integrated utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants as a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2019  counterparties posted approximately 13 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   24 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

im 

the upa between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant have expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a upa between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the upa between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco upa expires in december 2022 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 parent owns 3917 and opco owns 43 under the intercompany power agreement icpa which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the icpa terminates in june 2040 the proceeds from charges by ovec to sponsoring companies under the icpa based on their prower participation ratios are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs ovec’s board of directors as elected by aep and the other owners has authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests with resulting expenses including for related debt and interest thereon included in charges under the icpa ovec financed capital expenditures totaling 13 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances both ovec generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service opco attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the icpa to an affiliate 

as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by ohio law opco failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of ovec and therefore filed a request with the puco seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of ovec in december 2013 the puco approved opco’s request subject to the condition that energy from the ovec entitlements are sold into the dayahead or realtime pjm energy markets or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangement in november 2016 the puco approved opco’s request to approve a costbased purchased power agreement ppa rider effective in january 2017 that would initially be based upon opco’s contractual entitlement under the icpa which is approximately 20 of ovec’s capacity in january 2020 provisions enacted as part of ohio am sub hb 6 went into effect that replace the ppa rider and enable opco to continue recovering the net cost associated with the icpa including any additional contractual entitlement received as a result of the firstenergy solutions fes bankruptcy through 2030 

in march 2018 fes with an aggregate power participation ratio of approximately 5 under the icpa filed bankruptcy in july 2018 the bankruptcy court granted fes’s motion to reject the icpa ovec appealed this decision in the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit and in december 2019 the sixth circuit remanded the rejection of the icpa back to the bankruptcy court for further consideration based on reversing the bankruptcy court’s application of the business judgment standard in rejecting the icpa if ovec does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations there is risk that apco im andor opco may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments further if ovec’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that apco im andor opco may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347 the foregoing and other related actions have adversely impacted the credit ratings of ovec 

electric delivery 

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with pjm and spp and as approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – competition 

transmission agreement ta 

apco im kgpco kpco and wpco own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the pjm oatt and are parties to the ta opco which is a subsidiary in aep’s transmission and distribution utilities segment that provides transmission service under the pjm oatt is also a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by pjm the ta has been approved by the ferc

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of much of the energy policy act of 2005 which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs 

as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4  rate matters included in the 2019 annual report for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a combined costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and aep has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers in addition the ferc regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees additionally the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of aep’s public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

competition 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they currently maintain a competitive position 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aep texas and opco opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1494000 retail customers in ohio opco purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve generation service customers who have not switched to a competitive generation supplier aep texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1049000 retail customers through reps in west central and southern texas

generation  marketing 

general 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business the primary fossil generation subsidiary in the generation  marketing segment is agr as of december 31 2019  agr owns 1294 mws of generating capacity management plans to close 51 of this generation capacity in may 2020 almost all of the remaining generating capacity is operated by buckeye power a nonaffiliated electric cooperative other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

with respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries enter into shortterm and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ercot spp miso and pjm these subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities these activities primarily involve the purchaseandsale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent otc swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to the retail supply and energy management business aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity andor natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides various energy solutions in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had approximately 470000 customer accounts as of december 31 2019  

aep energy supply llc is a holding company with several divisions including aep renewables and aep onsite partners 

aep renewables develops owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the united states aep renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals as of december 31 2019 aep renewables owned projects operating in 11 states including approximately 1212 mws of installed wind capacity and approximately 90 mws of installed solar capacity these figures include the 2019 addition of 724 mws of wind generation and battery assets located in several states acquired from sempra renewables llc and the 75 interest or 227 mws of santa rita east wind generation located in west texas in october 2019 aep renewables entered into an agreement to construct flat ridge 3 a wind farm in kansas the 128 mw facility is expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2020 

aep onsite partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities aep onsite partners targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers as of december 31 2019 aep onsite partners owned projects located in 17 states including approximately 119 mws of installed solar capacity and approximately 28 mws of solar projects under construction 

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to the ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act the ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable the ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 the ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of agr and set costbased rates if the ferc subsequently determines that it can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions periodically agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to the ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies agr is also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

competition 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation because most of agr’s remaining generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s generation  marketing segment agr also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of agr’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive 

this segment’s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and washington dc each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition sustained low natural gas and power prices low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business 

this segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under longterm contracts to creditworthy counterparties new sources are not acquired without first securing a longterm placement of such power existing sources do not face competitive exposure competitive nonaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the generation  marketing segment not including aep energy partners’ offtake agreement from the oklaunion power station 



  

management expects the decline in coal generation sources to continue into 2020 due to the shutdown of conesville unit 4 in may 2020 

coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coalfired units agr through its contracts with third party transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities agr plants consumed 25 million tons of coal in 2019  

the coal supplies at agr plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries agr aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 20 to 60 days of full load burn as of december 31 2019  the coal inventory of agr was within the target range 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2019  counterparties posted approximately 16 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately   169 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

as of december 31 2019  the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 1212 mws of companyowned domestic wind power facilities 101 mws of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 355 mws of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers the interest of aep texas in the oklaunion power station to aepep management has announced plans to close oklaunion power station by october 2020 the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of regulated operations 

aep may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives aep’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected aep subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments this would cause financial results to be diminished 

regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit aep’s ability to recover costs and other amounts applies to all registrants 

the rates customers pay to aep regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia in certain instances aep’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval aep cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the ferc or the respective state commissions in establishing rates 

if regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved see note 4 – rate matters included in the 2019 annual report for additional information 

aep’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy applies to all registrants 

a significant portion of aep’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if the ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected aep’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted management believes aep’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives aep an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp ercot or other rtos will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to aep 

certain elements of aep’s transmission formula rates have been challenged which could result in lowered rates andor refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on aep’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows applies to all registrants other than aep texas 

aep provides transmission service under rates regulated by the ferc the ferc has approved the costbased formula rate templates used by aep to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates all aspects of aep’s rates accepted or approved by the ferc including the formula rate templates the rates of return on the actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures are subject to challenge by interested parties at the ferc or by the ferc on its own initiative in addition interested parties may challenge the annual 

implementation and calculation by aep of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under aep’s formula rate implementation protocols if a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential then the ferc can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them andor disallow any of aep’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula 

aep settled challenges to its spp and pjm formula rates in proceedings at the ferc in 2019 however inquiries related to rates of return as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities are ongoing in other proceedings at the ferc the results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact aep in any future challenges to aep’s formula rates if the ferc orders revenue reductions including refunds in any future cases related to its formula rates it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

enduse consumers and entities supplying electricity to enduse consumers may also attempt to influence government andor regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to aep particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises applies to all registrants 

aep primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise this method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery these developments can challenge aep’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity 

  

aep may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other thirdparty suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects aep’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur in addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled 

aep is exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

im owns the cook plant which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2288 mws or about 7 of the generating capacity in the aep system aep and im are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 



 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants in addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the cook plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require aep or im to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs the ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

aep subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control applies to all registrants 

results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various rtos including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues existing new or changed rules of these rtos could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design in addition these rtos may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights as members of these rtos aep’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks including the allocation among existing members of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets 

aep could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to all registrants 

owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject aep to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if aep were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards aep could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

a substantial portion of the receivables of aep texas is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows financial condition and results of operations applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from reps that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers as of december 31 2019  aep texas did business with approximately 120 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments aep texas depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable puct regulations significantly limit the extent to which aep texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and aep texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort in 2019  aep texas’ first second and third largest reps accounted for 20 14 and 14 respectively of its operating revenue any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments aep texas had received from such rep 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if aep is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions applies to all registrants 

performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission andor distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage aep’s reputation applies to all registrants 

aep and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owneroperators of generation transmission andor distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading aep and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or aep operations could view these computer systems software or networks as targets for cyber attack in addition the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

a security breach of aep or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems interconnected entities in rtos or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject aep and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data a successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to aep’s reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

if aep is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition applies to all registrants 

aep relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect aep’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies such as aep that rely on fossil fuels if sources of capital for aep are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

shareholder activism could cause aep to incur significant expense hinder execution of aep’s business strategy and impact aep’s stock price applies to all registrants 

shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and aep’s board’s attention and resources from aep’s business additionally such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to aep’s future adversely affect aep’s relationships with its employees customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also aep may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors aep’s stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism 

the potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing applies to all registrants 

a portion of the registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars libor tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates rates set by the us federal reserve and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions accordingly registrants’ interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is considering replacing us dollar libor with the secured overnight funding rate which is calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere to the extent these interest rates increase interest expense will increase if sources of capital for the registrants are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition andor liquidity 

downgrades in aep’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital applies to all registrants 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review aep’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to aep and could limit access to funding for operations recently a credit rating agency placed aep’s credit rating on negative outlook primarily because a key criterion the ratio of cash flow from operations excluding working capital to debt is expected to decline due to higher capital spending and lower cash flows resulting from changes in tax law aep’s business is capital intensive and aep is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive if aep’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained aep’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep and aeptco have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries applies to aep and aeptco 

aep and aeptco are holding companies and have no operations of their own their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries primarily their regulated utilities and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from them their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep or aeptco to provide them with funds for their payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep or aeptco by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep and aeptco indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

aep’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions applies to all registrants 

electric power consumption is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition in addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause including international tariffs generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning applies to all registrants and to aep and im with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning 

the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets discount rates the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan changes in actuarial assumptions future government regulation changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of aep’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and aep could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations 

additionally im holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant the rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts 

aep’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or decline in customer demand applies to all registrants 

growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of aep such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity 

certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to further reduce energy consumption additionally technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption some or all of these factors could impact the demand for electricity 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations applies to all registrants 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business if aep is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in the price of commodities the cost of procuring fuel emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase aep’s cost of producing power impacting financial performance applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel including the cost to procure coal and gas and the price and availability to transport fuel aep has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel but as these contracts end or if they are not honored aep may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts the inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life and while aep typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances there can be no assurance in the future that aep will recover such costs similarly aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances aep uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures based on current environmental programs remaining in effect aep has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa attempts to further reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if aep needs to obtain allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs aep’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past changes in the cost of fuel emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are markedtomarket they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change applies to all registrants 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events such as fires customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require aep to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of the aep service territory could also have an impact on revenues aep buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on aep’s own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as aep buys shortterm energy to serve aep’s own system which would increase the cost of energy aep provides to customers 

severe weather and weatherrelated events impact aep’s service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes fires floods and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase aep’s cost of providing service will increase and these costs may not be recoverable changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact aep’s ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy aep may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact revenues aep’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies aep serves the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the aep system 

management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to aep’s business activities applies to all registrants 

aep is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6  commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2019 annual report adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

disruptions at power generation facilities owned by thirdparties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas transmits and distributes electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by thirdparties if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of aep’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties applies to all registrants 

aep operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime equipment interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks the hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties aep maintains property and casualty insurance but aep is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to aep’s business such as damage to poles towers and lines or losses caused by outages 

aeptco depends on its affiliates in the aep system for a substantial portion of its revenues applies to aeptco 

aeptco’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the aep system management expects that these affiliates will continue to be aeptco’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future for the year ended december 31 2019  its affiliates were responsible for approximately 79 of the consolidated transmission revenues of aeptco 

most of the real property rights on which the assets of aeptco are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates applies to aeptco 

aeptco does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located instead under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective aep system utility affiliate that overlay its operations the ability of aeptco to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates which may be encumbered by easements mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property aep can give no assurance that a the relevant aep system utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of aeptco b suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant aep system utility affiliates are not its affiliates and c the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit aeptco to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety a majority of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste including coalcombustion residuals or “ccr” resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires aep to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees disposal and permits at aep facilities and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission ccr waste andor discharge obligations are tightened more extensive operating andor permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated although aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers there can be no assurance in the future that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions could materially increase costs to aep and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in 2014 the federal epa issued standards for new modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development of sips that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units the standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015 and were challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders the us supreme court stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources known as the clean power plan while the courts considered those challenges in 2017 the federal epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and in 2018 the federal epa proposed new guidelines that would allow states to establish unitspecific performance standards based on their evaluation of past performance and whether certain efficiency improvement measures could be applied at existing coalfired units the federal epa also proposed to change the new source performance standard for new coalfired utility units to 1900  2000 pounds per mwh depending on the size of the unit an increase from the current standard of 1400 pounds per mwh based on its determination that carbon capture and storage is not available everywhere and is not sufficiently costeffective to be considered the best available control technology for coalfired units the new guidelines were finalized in 2019 and the clean power plan was repealed challenges to both of these actions are pending in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 

co 2 standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of aep’s coalfired units while aep typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential co 2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers there can be no assurance that aep would recover such costs 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order aep to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which aep among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against aep substantial modifications or retirement of aep’s existing coalfired power plants could be required and aep might be required to purchase power from thirdparties to fulfill aep’s commitments to supply power to aep customers this could have a material impact on revenues in addition aep could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations unless recovered those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by aep resulting from the management of aep’s trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position 

aep’s power trading activities also expose aep to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that aep’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls aep would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

in connection with these trading activities aep routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options otc options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose aep to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner aep does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations 

parties with whom aep has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm aep’s results of operations applies to all registrants 

aep sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis aep also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations aep is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe aep money or the delivery of a commodity including power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform aep may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed aep’s contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and aep might incur losses although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

aep relies on electric transmission facilities that aep does not own or control if these facilities do not provide aep with adequate transmission capacity aep may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of aep’s power applies to all registrants 

aep depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power aep sells at wholesale this dependence exposes aep to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate aep may not be able to sell and deliver aep wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate aep’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

ovec may require additional liquidity and other capital support applies to aep apco im and opco 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies own ovec the intercompany power agreement icpa defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it under the icpa parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 if a party fails to make payments owed by it under the icpa ovec may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness as of december 31 2019 ovec has outstanding indebtedness of approximately 14 billion  of which apco im and opco are collectively responsible for 589 million through the icpa although they are not an obligor or guarantor apco im and opco are responsible for their respective ratio of ovec’s outstanding debt through the icpa 

firstenergy solutions “fes” a nonaffiliated party whose aggregate power participation ratio is 485 under the icpa has filed a petition seeking protection under bankruptcy law litigation related to these filings continues in addition as a result of these and prior related developments ovec’s credit ratings have been adversely impacted 

  

if ovec does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations there is risk that apco im andor opco may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments further if ovec’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that apco im andor opco may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347 also as a result of the credit rating agencies’ actions ovec’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs will increase

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

aep’s revolving credit agreement which backstops the commercial paper program includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test in addition the acceleration of aep’s payment obligations or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under the credit agreement as of december 31 2018  aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see “financial condition” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

operations for aep subsidiaries are subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule 

in november 2015 the federal epa issued a final rule revising effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating facilities the rule establishes limits on flue gas desulfurization wastewater fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed as soon as possible after november 2018 and no later than december 2023 see “environmental issues  clean water act regulations” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

coal ash regulation 

aep’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion byproducts including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials the federal epa rule regulates the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close see “environmental issues  coal combustion residual rule” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting aep’s power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the caa includes a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2  emissions from power plants and requirements for power plants and requirements for power plants to reduce no x  emissions through the use of available combustion controls collectively called the acid rain program aep continues to meet its obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets 

national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips see “environmental issues  clean air act requirements” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

hazardous air pollutants hap 

the caa also requires the federal epa to investigate hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submit a report to congress to determine whether those emissions should be regulated in 2011 the federal epa issued a rule setting maximum achievable control technology standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards for emissions from new and modified power plants in 2014 the us supreme court determined that the federal epa acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hap emissions from electric generating units the federal epa has engaged in additional rulemaking activity but the 2011 rule remains in effect see “environmental issues  hazardous air pollutants” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018 annual report for additional information 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso executed a settlement with the federal epa and the state of oklahoma to comply with regional haze program requirements in oklahoma and the settlement is now codified in the oklahoma sip and approved by the federal epa the federal epa disapproved portions of the arkansas and texas sips and finalized fips for both states challenges to both federal plans are pending in the courts see “environmental issues  clean air act requirements” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

climate change 

aep has taken action to reduce and offset co 2  emissions from its generating fleet and expects co 2  emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities in 2018 aep announced new intermediate and longterm co 2  emission reduction goals based on the output of the company’s integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand regulations grid reliability and resiliency and reflect the company’s current business strategy the intermediate goal is a 60 reduction from 2000 co 2  emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is an 80 reduction of co 2  emissions from aep generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050 aep’s total estimated co 2 emissions in 2018 were approximately 69 million metric tons a 59 reduction from aep’s 2000 co 2  emissions of approximately 167 million metric tons 

the federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2  emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the caa the clean power plan was adopted in october 2015 but the us supreme court issued a stay of its implementation including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans in 2017 the federal epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and in 2018 the federal epa issued a proposal to revise the standards for new and modified sources and less stringent proposed guidelines to replace the clean power plan see “environmental issues  climate change co 2  regulation and energy policy” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as aep diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals management’s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying aep’s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support 

transforming our generation fleet 

the electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation driven by changing customer needs policy demands demographics competitive offerings technologies and commodity prices amid this changing landscape aep is also transforming to be more agile and customerfocused as a valued provider of energy solutions aep’s longterm commitment to reduce co2 emissions reflects the current direction of the company’s resource plans to meet those needs aep’s exposure to carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years from 2000 to 2017 aep’s co2 emissions declined 57 percent in 2018 coal represented 47 percent of aep’s generating capacity compared with 70 percent in 2005 management expects the percentage of aep’s generating resources fueled by coal will continue to decline transforming aep’s generation portfolio to include more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient use of energy demand response distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid over time is part of this strategy 

the graph below summarizes aep’s generation capacity by resource type for the years 1999 2005 and 2018 



renewable sources of energy 

the states aep serves other than kentucky west virginia and tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources 

as of december 31 2018  aep’s regulated utilities had longterm contracts for 2750 mws of wind and 10 mws of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers in addition im owns four solar projects that make up im’s 15 mw clean energy solar pilot project management actively manages aep’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

the growth of aep’s renewable portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers in addition to gradually reducing aep’s reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps aep to maintain a diversity of generation resources 

the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by aep’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect aep’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world aep has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources transmission assets of the aep system interconnect approximately 11900 mws of renewable energy resources aep’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources 

aep energy supply llc owned 261 mws of wind capacity in texas as of december 31 2018  aep renewables llc develops andor acquires large scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties as of december 2018 aep renewables llc owned two 20 mw solar projects in california and utah and a 50 mw solar project in nevada in december 2018 aep renewables llc entered into an agreement to own an additional 227 mws of texas wind capacity which is expected to be placed inservice in mid2019 

aep onsite partners llc works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities the company targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners llc pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers as of december 31 2018 aep onsite partners llc owned projects operating in 15 states including approximately 85 mws of installed solar capacity and approximately 57 mws of solar projects under construction 

in february 2019 aep clean energy resources llc signed an agreement to purchase sempra renewables llc and its 724 mws of wind generation and battery assets for approximately 11 billion subject to closing and working capital adjustments as part of the purchase price aep clean energy resources llc will pay 551 million in cash and assume 343 million of existing project debt obligations of the nonconsolidated joint ventures additionally the acquisition will be accompanied by the recognition of noncontrolling tax equity interest of 162 million associated with certain of the acquired wind farms the wind generation portfolio includes seven wholly or jointlyowned wind farms with longterm ppas for 100 of their energy production the transaction is expected to close in mid2019 and is subject to regulatory approvals from the ferc and federal clearance pursuant to the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 

competitive renewable generation facilities 





end use energy efficiency 

aep has reduced energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available aep’s operating companies’ programs have reduced annual consumption by over 8 million mwhs and peak demand by approximately 2555 mws since 2008 aep estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 14 billion during that period to achieve these levels 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states aep serves appropriate cost recovery will be essential for aep operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments as aep continues to transition to a cleaner more efficient energy future energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers aep believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a costeffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of aep’s strategic plan the board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets the board of directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would significantly affect the company the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about the company’s environmental social governance and financial performance in addition as a result of ongoing corporate governance outreach efforts with shareholders aep set new co 2  emission reduction goals that were published in a new report in february 2018 “american electric power strategic vision for a clean energy future” 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see “the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation” section of note 6  included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2016  2017  and 2018  and the current estimate for 2019  are shown below these investments include both environmental as well as other related spending estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital in addition to the amounts set forth below aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants’ facilities for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2018  or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more stringent the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system aep typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition see “environmental issues” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial 

condition and results of operations and note 6   commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 



 

management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals the following cost estimates for the years 2019  through 2025 will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the federal epa provides flexibility in the final rules these cost estimates will also change based on a the states’ implementation of these regulatory programs including the potential for sips or fips that impose more stringent standards b additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions c the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units d changes in costs for new pollution controls e new generating technology developments f total mws of capacity retired replaced or sold including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and g other factors management’s current ranges of estimates of new major environmental investments beginning in 2019  exclusive of debt afudc are set forth below 



business segments 

aep’s reportable segments 

aep’s primary business is the generation transmission and distribution of electricity within its vertically integrated utilities segment aep centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of costbased rates and regulatory oversight intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements aep’s reportable segments are as follows 

 

the remainder of aep’s activities is presented as corporate and other which is not considered a reportable segment see note 9   business segments included in the 2018  annual report for additional information on aep’s segments 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2018  aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23000 mws of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type including wind purchase agreements on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2018  fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities remained flat on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2017  

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers marketers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2018  decreased approximately 2 from 2017  

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 3664 railcars 468 barges 9 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in aep generating facilities 

spot market prices for coal started to strengthen in the second half of 2018  the increased spot coal prices reflect tighter supplies and increased demand for export coal as of december 31 2018  approximately half of the coal purchased by aep’s subsidiaries was procured through term contracts as those contracts expire or reopen for price adjustments needed tonnage is replaced at current market prices as necessary the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods the price paid for coal delivered in 2018  decreased approximately 2 from 2017  

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2018  the vertically integrated utilities’ coal inventory was approximately 32 days of full load burn while inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the vertically integrated utilities is approximately 30 days 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed approximately 112 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2018  for generating power this represents an increase of 29 from 2017  total gas consumption for the vertically integrated utilities was higher year over year primarily due to lower natural gas prices and increased demand for electricity several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate aep’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of snf im completed modifications to its snf storage pool in the early 1990’s im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of snf to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis im completed its initial loading of snf into the dry casks in 2012 which consisted of 12 casks 32 snf assemblies contained within each the second loading of snf into dry casks which consisted of 16 casks was completed in 2015 the third dry cask loading campaign which also consisted of 16 casks was completed in 2018 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of snf and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the snf disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2018 the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant was 2 billion in 2018 nondiscounted dollars with additional ongoing estimated costs of 6 million per year for post decommissioning storage of snf and an eventual estimated cost of 37 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility also 

in 2018 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 22 billion the balance of funds available to eventually decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections aep will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections see the “nuclear contingencies” section of note 6   commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2018  annual report for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable it can be stored onsite at this facility 

counterparty risk management 

the vertically integrated utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants as a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2018  counterparties posted approximately 9 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   54 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

im 

the upa between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant have expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of much of the energy policy act of 2005 which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period 

of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4   rate matters included in the 2018  annual report for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a combined costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and aep has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers in addition the ferc regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees additionally the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of aep’s public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

competition 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they currently maintain a competitive position 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aep texas and opco opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1486000  retail customers in ohio opco purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve generation service customers who have not switched to a competitive generation supplier aep texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1050000  retail customers through reps in west central and southern texas

generation  marketing 

general 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business the primary fossil generation subsidiary in the generation  marketing segment is agr in january 2017 agr sold 4143 mws of generation capacity to a nonaffiliated thirdparty and terminated a 1186 mw upa as of december 31 2018  agr owns 2114 mws of generating capacity management plans to close 39 of this generation capacity in may 2019 and 31 in may 2020 28 of this generating capacity is operated by buckeye power a nonaffiliated electric cooperative other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

with respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries enter into shortterm and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ercot spp miso and pjm these subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities 

these activities primarily involve the purchaseandsale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent otc swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to the retail supply and energy management business aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity andor natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides various energy solutions in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had approximately 415000 customer accounts as of december 31 2018  

aep energy supply llc owns 261 mws of wind capacity in texas aep renewables llc develops andor acquires large scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties as of december 2018 aep renewables llc owns a 20 mw solar project in california a 20 mw solar project in utah and a 50 mw solar project in nevada in december 2018 aep renewables llc entered into an agreement to own an additional 227 mw of texas wind capacity which is expected to be placed inservice in mid2019 

aep onsite partners llc works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities the company targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners llc pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers as of december 31 2018 aep onsite partners llc owned projects operating in 15 states including approximately 85 mws of installed solar capacity and approximately 57 mws of solar projects under construction 

in february 2019 aep clean energy resources llc signed an agreement to purchase sempra renewables llc and its 724 mws of wind generation and battery assets for approximately 11 billion subject to closing and working capital adjustments as part of the purchase price aep clean energy resources llc will pay 551 million in cash and assume 343 million of existing project debt obligations of the nonconsolidated joint ventures additionally the acquisition will be accompanied by the recognition of noncontrolling tax equity interest of 162 million associated with certain of the acquired wind farms the wind generation portfolio includes seven wholly or jointlyowned wind farms with longterm ppas for 100 of their energy production the transaction is expected to close in mid2019 and is subject to regulatory approvals from the ferc and federal clearance pursuant to the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to the ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act the ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable the ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 the ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of agr and set costbased rates if the ferc subsequently determines that it can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions periodically agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to the ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies agr is also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

competition 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation because most of agr’s remaining generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s generation  marketing segment agr also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of agr’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive 

in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity these events could cause agr to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life 

this segment’s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and washington dc each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition sustained low natural gas and power prices low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business 

this segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under longterm contracts to creditworthy counterparties new sources are not acquired without first securing a longterm placement of such 

power existing sources do not face competitive exposure competitive nonaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts 

seasonality 

the consumption of electric power is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the generation  marketing segment not including aep energy partners’ offtake agreement from the oklaunion power station 



coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units agr through its contracts with third party transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities agr plants consumed 3 million tons of coal in 2018  

the coal supplies at agr plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries agr aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn as of december 31 2018  the coal inventory of agr was within the target range 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2018  counterparties posted approximately 22 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately   101 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see the “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

certain power agreements 

as of december 31 2018  the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 261 mws of companyowned domestic wind power facilities 177 mws of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 355 mws of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers the interest of aep texas in the oklaunion power station to aepep management has announced plans to close oklaunion power station by october 2020 the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of regulated operations 

aep may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives aep’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected aep subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments this would cause financial results to be diminished 

regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit aep’s ability to recover costs and other amounts applies to all registrants 

the rates customers pay to aep regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia in certain instances aep’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval aep cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the ferc or the respective state commissions in establishing rates 

if regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved see note 4  – rate matters included in the 2018  annual report for additional information 

aep’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy applies to all registrants 

a significant portion of aep’s earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if the ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected aep’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted management believes aep’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives aep an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp ercot or other rtos will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to aep 

certain elements of aep’s transmission formula rates have been challenged which could result in lowered rates andor refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on aep’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows applies to all registrants other than aep texas 

aep provides transmission service under rates regulated by the ferc the ferc has approved the costbased formula rate templates used by aep to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates all aspects of aep’s rates accepted or approved by the ferc including the formula rate templates the rates of return on the actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures are subject to challenge by interested parties at the ferc or by the ferc on its own initiative in addition interested parties may challenge the annual 

implementation and calculation by aep of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under aep’s formula rate implementation protocols if a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential then the ferc will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them andor disallow any of aep’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula 

parties have challenged aep’s formula rates in proceedings at the ferc if the ferc orders revenue reductions as a result of these or other complaints including refunds from the date of any complaint filing it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

enduse consumers and entities supplying electricity to enduse consumers may also attempt to influence government andor regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to aep particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises applies to all registrants 

aep primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise this method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery these developments can challenge aep’s competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity 

  

aep may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other thirdparty suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects aep’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur in addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled 

aep is exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

im owns the cook plant which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2278  mws or about 7 of the generating capacity in the aep system aep and im are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 



 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants in addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the cook plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require aep or im to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs the ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

aep subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control applies to all registrants 

results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various rtos including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues existing new or changed rules of these rtos could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design in addition these rtos may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights as members of these rtos aep’s subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks including the allocation among existing members of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets 

aep could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to all registrants 

owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject aep to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if aep were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards aep could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

a substantial portion of the receivables of aep texas is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows financial condition and results of operations applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from reps that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers as of december 31 2018  aep texas did business with approximately 124 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments aep texas depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable puct regulations significantly limit the extent to which aep texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and aep texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort in 2018  aep texas’ first second and third largest reps accounted for 19 15 and 11 respectively of its operating revenue any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments aep texas had received from such rep 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if aep is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions applies to all registrants 

performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission andor distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage aep’s reputation   applies to all registrants 

aep and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owneroperators of generation transmission andor distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading aep and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or aep operations could view these computer systems software or networks as targets for cyber attack in addition the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

a security breach of aep or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems interconnected entities in rtos or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject aep and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data a successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to aep’s reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

if aep is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition applies to all registrants 

aep relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect aep’s ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies such as aep that rely on fossil fuels if sources of capital for aep are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

the potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing applies to all registrants 

a portion of the registrants’ indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars libor tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates rates set by the us federal reserve and other central banks the supply of and demand for credit in the london interbank market and general economic conditions aep has not hedged its interest rate exposure with respect to its floating rate debt accordingly registrants’ interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is considering replacing us dollar libor with a newly created index calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere to the extent these interest rates increase interest expense will increase if sources of capital for the registrants are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition andor liquidity 

downgrades in aep’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital applies to all registrants 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review aep’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to aep and could limit access to funding for operations aep’s business is capital intensive and aep is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive if aep’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained aep’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

aep’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions applies to all registrants 

electric power consumption is generally seasonal in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition in addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning applies to all registrants and to aep and im with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning 

the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets discount rates the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan changes in actuarial assumptions future government regulation changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of aep’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and aep could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations 

additionally im holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant the rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts 

aep’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or decline in customer demand applies to all registrants 

growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of aep such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity 

certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to further reduce energy consumption additionally technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption some or all of these factors could impact the demand for electricity 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations applies to all registrants 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business if aep is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in the price of commodities emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase aep’s cost of producing power impacting financial performance applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel including coal and gas and the price and availability to transport fuel aep has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel but as these contracts end or if they are not honored aep may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances aep uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures based on current environmental programs remaining in effect aep has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa attempts to further reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if aep needs to obtain allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs aep’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past changes in the cost of fuel emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are marked to market they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change applies to all registrants 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events such as fires customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require aep to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of the aep service territory could also have an impact on revenues aep buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on aep’s own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as aep buys shortterm energy to serve aep’s own system which would increase the cost of energy aep provides to customers 

severe weather and weatherrelated events impact aep’s service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes fires floods and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase aep’s cost of providing service will increase and these costs may not be recoverable changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact aep’s ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy aep may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact revenues aep’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies aep serves the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the aep system 

management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to aep’s business activities applies to all registrants 

aep is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6   commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2018  annual report adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

disruptions at power generation facilities owned by thirdparties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas transmits and distributes electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by thirdparties if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of aep’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties applies to all registrants 

aep operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime equipment interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks the hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties aep maintains property and casualty insurance but aep is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to aep’s business such as damage to poles towers and lines or losses caused by outages 

aeptco depends on its affiliates in the aep system for a substantial portion of its revenues applies to aeptco 

aeptco’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the aep system management expects that these affiliates will continue to be aeptco’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future for the year ended december 31 2018  its affiliates were responsible for approximately 77   of the consolidated transmission revenues of   aeptco 

most of the real property rights on which the assets of aeptco are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates applies to aeptco 

aeptco does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located instead under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective aep system utility affiliate that overlay its operations the ability of aeptco to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates which may be encumbered by easements mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property aep can give no assurance that a the relevant aep system utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of aeptco b suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant aep system utility affiliates are not its affiliates and c the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit aeptco to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety a majority of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires aep to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all aep facilities and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated although aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers there can be no assurance that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

regulation of co 2  emissions could materially increase costs to aep and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in 2014 the federal epa issued standards for new modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development of sips that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units the standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015 and have been challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders the us supreme court has stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources known as the clean power plan until a final decision is issued by the courts in 2017 the federal epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered in the development of new emission guidelines in 2018 the federal epa issued proposed guidelines that would allow states to establish unitspecific performance standards based on their evaluation of past performance and whether certain efficiency improvement measures could be applied at existing coalfired units the federal epa also proposed to change the new source performance standard for new coalfired utility units to 1900  2000 pounds per mwh depending on the size of the unit an increase from the current standard of 1400 pounds per mwh based on its determination that carbon capture and storage is not available everywhere and is not sufficiently costeffective to be considered the best available control technology for coalfired units 

co 2  standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of aep’s coalfired units while aep typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential co 2  and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers there can be no assurance that aep would recover such costs 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order aep to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which aep among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against aep substantial modifications of aep’s existing coalfired power plants could be required and aep might be required to limit or reduce emissions such remedies could require aep to purchase power from thirdparties to fulfill aep’s commitments to supply power to aep customers this could have a material impact on costs in addition aep could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations unless recovered those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by aep resulting from the management of aep’s trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position 

aep’s power trading activities also expose aep to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that aep’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls aep would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

in connection with these trading activities aep routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options otc options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose aep to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner aep does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations 

parties with whom aep has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm aep’s results of operations applies to all registrants 

aep sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis aep also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations aep is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe aep money or the delivery of a commodity including power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform aep may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed aep’s contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and aep might incur losses although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

aep relies on electric transmission facilities that aep does not own or control if these facilities do not provide aep with adequate transmission capacity aep may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of aep’s power applies to all registrants 

aep depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power aep sells at wholesale this dependence exposes aep to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate aep may not be able to sell and deliver aep wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate aep’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

ovec may require additional liquidity and other capital support applies to aep apco im and opco 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies own ovec the intercompany power agreement icpa defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it under the icpa parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 if a party fails to make payments owed by it under the icpa ovec may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness as of december 31 2018 ovec has outstanding indebtedness of approximately 14 billion of which apco im and opco are collectively responsible for 604 million through the icpa although they are not an obligor or guarantor apco im and opco are responsible for their respective ratio of ovec’s outstanding debt through the icpa 

firstenergy solutions “fes” a nonaffiliated party whose aggregate power participation ratio is 485 under the icpa has filed a petition seeking protection under bankruptcy law the bankruptcy court has granted the motion of fes to reject the icpa litigation related to these filings continues in addition as a result of these and prior related developments ovec’s credit ratings have been adversely impacted 

  

if ovec does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations there is risk that apco im andor opco may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments further if ovec’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that apco im andor opco may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347 also as a result of the credit rating agencies’ actions ovec’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs will increase

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

operations for aep subsidiaries are subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule the standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a sitespecific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the us court of appeals for the second circuit and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court 

in november 2015 the federal epa issued a final rule to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s national pollutant discharge elimination system program for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues 

coal ash regulation 

aep’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion byproducts including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials effective october 2015 the federal epa adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the final rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule to be implemented by the end of 2018 if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues  coal combustion residual rule 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting aep’s power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements aep has made significant longterm investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants between 2000 and 2017  aep invested approximately 86 billion in environmental controls primarily related to the caa that have significantly reduced emissions from 2001 and including projections through 2018  aep expects its emissions of mercury will be lower by approximately 8300 pounds a reduction of approximately 87 since 1990 and including projections through 2018  aep expects its emissions of so 2 and no x  will be lower by approximately 1460000 tons and 560000 tons respectively a reduction of approximately 94 and 89 respectively 

the acid rain program 

the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2  emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2  emissions of 89 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010 the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x  emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2  capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs aep continues to meet its obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2  and no x  emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many aep facilities additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities 

national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25  standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new rule that lowered the annual standard was signed by the administrator in december 2012 a new ozone standard was adopted in 2015 the federal epa also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2  in 2010 a lower standard for no x  in 2010 and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2016 the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011 the states are in the process of developing new sips for the so 2  pm 25  and ozone standards which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on aep facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which required additional reductions in so 2  and no x  emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs in august 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that contains more stringent requirements to control so 2  and no x  emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 27 states and the district of columbia petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and csapr was vacated that decision was subsequently reversed by the us supreme court and remanded back to the us court of appeals for further proceedings the federal epa filed a motion to lift the stay and allow phase i of csapr to take effect on january 1 2015 and phase ii to take effect on january 1 2017 the court granted the federal epa’s motion and remanded certain state budgets to the federal epa for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect the federal epa adopted more stringent no x  budgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season based on the 2008 ozone naaqs for additional information regarding csapr see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues  clean air act requirements

as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants petitions for review of the mact standards were denied by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit but in 2014 the us supreme court determined that the federal epa acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units the federal epa has issued a supplemental finding which has also been challenged in the courts and the rule remains in effect 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso executed a settlement with the federal epa and the state of oklahoma to comply with regional haze program requirements in oklahoma and the settlement is now codified in the oklahoma sip pso is in the process of implementing the requirements of the sip the federal epa has disapproved portions of the arkansas and texas sips and finalized a federal implementation plan for arkansas in 2016 and a plan for texas in 2017 challenges to both federal plans are pending in the courts for additional information regarding cavr and the regional haze program requirements see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues  clean air act requirements 

climate change 

aep has taken action to reduce and offset co 2  emissions from its generating fleet and expects co 2  emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities in february 2018 aep announced new intermediate and longterm co 2  emission reduction goals based on the output of the company’s integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand regulations and grid reliability and resiliency and reflect the company’s current business strategy the intermediate goal is a 60 reduction from 2000 co 2  emission levels from aep generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is an 80 reduction of co 2  emissions from aep generating facilities from 2000 levels by 2050 aep’s total projected co 2  emissions in 2018  are approximately 90 million metric tons a 46 reduction from aep’s 2000 co 2  emissions of approximately 167 million metric tons the federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2  emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the caa the federal epa published the clean power plan in october 2015 the clean power plan is being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain in february 2016 the us supreme court issued a stay on the final clean power plan including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans the stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the us supreme court considers any petition for review    in 2017 the federal epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered in the development of new emission guidelines for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co 2  emissions including the clean power plan see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclimate change co 2  regulation and energy policy 

management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as aep diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals management’s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying aep’s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support 

renewable sources of energy 

the states aep serves other than kentucky west virginia and tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources 

at the end of 2017  the aep operating companies had longterm contracts for 2630 mws of wind and 10 mws of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers this includes apco’s 1197 mw longterm wind contract in indiana which began deliveries in january 2018 in addition im owns four solar projects that make up im’s 147 mw clean energy solar pilot project cespp that was approved by the iurc this resulted in a total of 2655 mws of wind and solar inservice serving aep’s regulated utilities management actively manages aep’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

the growth of aep’s renewable portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers in addition to gradually reducing aep’s reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps aep to maintain a diversity of generation resources 

the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by aep’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect aep’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world aep has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources transmission assets of the aep system interconnect approximately 11900 mws of renewable energy resources and aep’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources 

aep energy supply llc owns 311  mws of wind capacity in texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market in 2017 aep took several major steps in executing its strategic plan to develop and market a merchant distributed resource portfolio aep renewables llc was formed in april 2016 to develop andor acquire large scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties in 2017 aep renewables llc brought into service a 28 mw solar project in california and owns a 26 mw solar project in utah and a 62 mw solar project in nevada that were brought into service in 2016 and 2017 respectively 

aep onsite partners llc works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities the company targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners llc pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers as of december 31 2017  aep onsite partners llc owned projects operating in 12 states including 63 mws of installed solar capacity and another 34 mws of solar projects under construction 

competitive renewable generation facilities 



 

end use energy efficiency 

beginning in 2008 aep ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available since that time aep operating companies implemented programs that have reduced annual consumption by over 7 million mwhs and peak demand by approximately 2280 mws aep estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 12 billion during that period to achieve these levels 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states aep serves and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for aep operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments as aep continues to transition to a cleaner more efficient energy future energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of aep’s strategic plan the board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets the board of directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about the company’s environmental financial and social performance in addition as a result of ongoing corporate governance outreach efforts with shareholders aep set new carbon dioxide emission reduction goals that were published in a new report in february 2018 “american electric power strategic vision for a clean energy future” 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2017  annual reports under the heading entitled the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation for further information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2015  2016  and 2017  and the current estimate for 2018  are shown below these investments include both environmental as well as other related spending estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental 

regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital in addition to the amounts set forth below aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants’ facilities for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2017 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system aep typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions for aep’s merchant generation units however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled environmental issues and note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2017  annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 



 

management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals the following cost estimates for periods following 2018  will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the federal epa provides flexibility in the final rules these cost estimates will also change based on a the states’ implementation of these regulatory programs including the potential for state implementation plans sips or federal implementation plans fips that impose more stringent standards b additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions c the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units d changes in costs for new pollution controls e new generating technology developments f total mws of capacity retired replaced or sold including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and g other factors 

management’s current ranges of estimates of new major environmental investments excluding unregulated assets beginning in 2018  exclusive of debt afudc are set forth below 



business segments 

aep’s reportable segments 

aep’s primary business is the generation transmission and distribution of electricity within its vertically integrated utilities segment aep centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of costbased rates and regulatory oversight intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements 

aep’s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below 

vertically integrated utilities 

 

transmission and distribution utilities 

 

aep transmission holdco 

 

generation  marketing 

 

the remainder of aep’s activities is presented as corporate and other while not considered a reportable segment corporate and other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain aep utility subsidiaries parent’s guarantee revenue received from affiliates investment income interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs with the sale of aep river operations llc aepro a commercial barge operation in november 2015 the activities related to the aepro segment have been moved to corporate and other for the periods presented see “aepro corporate and other” section of note 7  for additional information 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2017  aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23000 mws of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type including wind purchase agreements on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2017  fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities remained flat on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2016  

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2017  decreased from 2016  due to additional planned outages 

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 3675 railcars 468 barges 11 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in aep generating facilities 

spot market prices for coal started to strengthen in the second half of 2017  the increased spot coal prices reflect tighter supplies and increased demand for export coal as of december 31 2017  approximately half of the coal purchased by aep’s subsidiaries was procured through term contracts as those contracts expire or reopen for price adjustments needed tonnage is replaced at current market prices as necessary the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods the price paid for coal delivered in 2017  decreased approximately 4 from 2016  

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2017  the vertically integrated utilities’ coal inventory was approximately 37 days of full load burn while inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the vertically integrated utilities is approximately 30 days 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed approximately 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2017  for generating power this represents a decrease of 17 from 2016  total gas consumption for the vertically integrated utilities was lower year over year primarily because higher natural gas prices in 2017  caused natural gas plants to be used less and for coal plants to be used more several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate aep’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities’ plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis im completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012 which consisted of 12 casks 32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each the second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015 which consisted of 16 casks the third dry cask loading campaign which is forecasted to also load 16 casks is expected to begin in the summer of 2018 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015 the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant was 16 billion in 2015 nondiscounted dollars with additional ongoing estimated costs of 5 million per year for post decommissioning storage of spent nuclear fuel and an eventual estimated cost of 57 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility also in 2015 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2017  the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 22 billion the balance of funds available to eventually decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections aep will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections see note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies included in the 2017  annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable it can be stored onsite at this facility 

counterparty risk management 

the vertically integrated utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants as a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2017  counterparties posted approximately 9 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   60 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2017  annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

certain power agreements 

im 

the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant have expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 parent owns 3917 and opco owns 43 under the intercompany power agreement icpa which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the icpa terminates in june 2040 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests ovec financed capital expenditures totaling 13 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances both ovec generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service opco attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the icpa to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by ohio law opco failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of ovec and therefore filed a request with the puco seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of ovec in december 2013 the puco approved opco’s request subject to the condition that energy from the ovec entitlements are sold into the dayahead or realtime pjm energy markets or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangemen t in november 2016 the puco approved opco’s request to approve a costbased pur chased power agreement ppa rider effective in january 2017 that would initially be based upon opco’s contractual entitlement under the icpa which is approximately 20 of ovec’s capacity some parties filed a rehearing challenge to the puco decision which was denied those parties filed an appeal before the supreme court of ohio to challenge the puco’s decision which remains pending in late 2016 two nonaffiliated parties to the icpa owned by first energy corp “fe” announced its intention to exit its merchant business and that it may pursue restructuring or bankruptcy fe’s aggregate power participation ratio is approximately 8 under the icpa presently fe has yet to pursue restructuring or bankruptcy however as a result of this announcement and other related developments moody’s downgraded ovec’s rating with a negative outlook for possible downgrade while fitch and sp have revised ovec’s outlook to negative 

electric delivery 

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with pjm and spp and as approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – competition 

transmission agreement ta 

apco im kgpco kpco and wpco own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the pjm oatt and are parties to the ta opco a subsidiary in aep’s transmission and distribution utilities segment is also a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by pjm the ta has been approved by the ferc

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4  to the financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2017  annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates currently frozen approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a combined costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and aep has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers in addition the ferc regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees additionally the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets ferc order 2000 prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of aep’s public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

competition 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they currently maintain a competitive position 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aep texas and opco opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1477000  retail customers in ohio opco purchases energy and capacity at auction to serve generation service customers who have not switched to a competitive generation supplier aep texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1030000  retail customers through reps in west central and southern texas 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the puct for aep texas and by the puco and the ferc for opco the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business 

the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules protocols and agreements in place with pjm and ercot and as approved by the ferc in addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies 

transmission agreement ta 

opco owns and operates transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the pjm oatt opco is a party to the ta with other utility subsidiary affiliates the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by pjm the ta has been approved by the ferc 

regional transmission organizations 

opco is a member of pjm a fercapproved rto rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not aep texas is a member of ercot 

regulation 

opco provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at costbased rates approved by the puco or by the ferc aep texas provides transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules transmission and distribution rates are established on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service the cost of service generally reflects operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for transmission of electric power accounting and other matters the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and it has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system additionally the transition and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

seasonality 

the delivery of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s transmission and distribution facilities in addition aep transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder in texas and to a lesser extent in ohio where we have residential decoupling unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

aep transmission holdco aepthco 

general 

aepthco is a holding company for a aeptco which is the direct holding company for the state transcos and b aep’s transmission joint ventures 

aeptco 

aeptco wholly owns the state transcos 

 

the state transcos are independent of but respectively overlay the following aep electric utility operating companies apco im kpco kgpco opco pso swepco and wpco the state transcos develop own operate and maintain their respective transmission assets assets of the state transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and unaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of pjm and spp aptco imtco ktco ohtco and wvtco are located within pjm oktco and swtco are located within spp 

imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco have received all necessary approvals for formation and currently own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions in december 2016 the virginia scc and wvpsc granted consent for apco and aptco to enter into a joint license agreement that will support aptco investment in the state of tennessee an application for regulatory approval for swtco is under consideration in louisiana 

the state transcos are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the ferc and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems the state transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with the ferc the rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed return on equity these rates are then included in an oatt for spp and pjm 

the state transcos own operate maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability grid security safety reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets a key part of aep’s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities assets and components of the existing aep system as needed to maintain reliability 

the state transcos provide the capability to replace and upgrade existing facilities as of december 31 2017  the state transcos had 55 billion of transmission assets inservice with plans to construct approximately 43 billion of additional transmission assets through 2020 additional investment in transmission infrastructure is needed within pjm and spp to maintain the required level of grid reliability resiliency security and efficiency and to address an aging transmission infrastructure additional transmission facilities will be needed based on changes in generating resources such as wind or solar projects generation additions or retirements and additional new customer interconnections aep will continue its investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid 

aepthco joint venture initiatives 

aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america transmission joint ventures 

the transmission joint ventures currently include 





aep’s joint ventures do not have employees business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and other aep subsidiaries and the joint venture partners during 2017  approximately 510 aepsc employees and 283 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures 

regulation 

the state transcos and the transmission joint ventures located outside of ercot establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to fercapproved implementation protocols the protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated 

the state transcos’ and the transmission joint ventures’ where applicable rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system the ferc requires transmission providers such as pjm and spp to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis 

the fercapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement atrr and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the ferc the formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous year’s billings allowing for overunderrecovery of the transmission owner’s atrr pjm and spp pay the transmission owners their atrr for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatt for the service taken additionally the state transcos are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

the formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 1149 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity for aptco imtco ktco ohtco and wvtco the east transcos oktco and swtco the west transcos are allowed a return on equity of 112 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity the authorized returns on equity for the state transcos are commensurate with the fercauthorized returns on equity in the pjm and spp oatts respectively for aep’s utility subsidiaries these returns have been challenged by parties in filings before the ferc 

in the annual rate base filings described above the state transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of 38 billion for 2017  32 billion for 2016  and 23 billion for 2015  the total transmission revenue requirements filed in the atrr including prior year overunderrecovery of revenue and associated carrying charges for 2017  2016  and 2015  was 690 million 555 million and 363 million respectively 

the rates of ett which is located in ercot are determined by the puct ett sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim transmission costs of services tcos filings ett may file interim tcos filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital 

effective march 2017 the transmission joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 96 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 

generation  marketing 

general 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business the largest subsidiary in the generation  marketing segment is agr in january 2017 agr sold 4143 mws of generation capacity to an unaffiliated third party and terminated a 1186 mw unit power agreement as of december 31 2017 agr owns 2564  mws of generating capacity other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

with respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries enter into shortterm and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ercot spp miso and pjm these subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities 

these activities primarily involve the purchaseandsale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent overthecounter swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to the retail supply and energy management business aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity andor natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides various energy solutions in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had approximately 410000 customer accounts as of december 31 2017  

as of december 31 2017 aep energy supply llc owns 311  mws of wind capacity in texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market during january 2018 a repowering agreement was entered into with a nonaffiliated party that contributed full turbine sets in exchange for a 20 ownership interest aep energy supply llc retained 80 ownership 248 mw of the wind capacity aep renewables llc develops andor acquires large scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties in 2017 aep renewables llc brought into service a 28 mw solar project in california and a 62 mw solar project in nevada the company also owns a 26 mw solar project in utah that was brought into service in 2016 

aep onsite partners llc works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities the company targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners llc pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers and appropriate agreements as of december 31 2017  aep onsite partners llc owned projects operating in twelve states including 63 mws of installed solar capacity and another 34 mws of solar projects under construction in six states 

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to the ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act the ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable the ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 the ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of agr 

and set costbased rates if the ferc subsequently determines that it can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions periodically agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to the ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies agr is also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of the ferc 

competition 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation because most of agr’s remaining generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s generation  marketing segment agr also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of agr’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive 

in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity these events could cause agr to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life 

this segment’s retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and washington dc each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition sustained low natural gas and power prices low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business 

this segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under longterm contracts to creditworthy counterparties new sources are not acquired without first securing a longterm placement of such power existing sources do not face competitive exposure competitive unaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the generation  marketing segment not including aep energy partners’ offtake agreement from the oklaunion generating unit 



in january 2017 aep sold three natural gas plants darby lawrenceburg and waterford to a nonaffiliated party the sale resulted in a decrease in aep’s natural gas supply in 2017 which increased aep’s coal supply as a percentage of total fuel supply in 2017 

coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units agr through its contracts with third party transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities agr plants consumed 46 million tons of coal in 2017  

the coal supplies at agr plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries agr aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn as of december 31 2017  the coal inventory of agr was above target 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2017  counterparties posted approximately 20 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately   97 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2017  annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

certain power agreements 

as of december 31 2017  the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 311 mws of companyowned domestic wind power facilities 177 mws of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 355 mws of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers the interest of aep texas in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of regulated operations 

aep may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives aep’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected aep subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments this would cause financial results to be diminished 

regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit aep’s ability to recover costs and other amounts applies to all registrants 

the rates customers pay to aep regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia in certain instances aep’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval aep cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the ferc or the respective state commissions in establishing rates 

if regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved for additional information see note 4  – rate matters and note 12  – income taxes of the notes to the financial statements included in the 2017 annual reports 

aep’s transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy applies to all registrants 

management expects that a growing portion of aep’s earnings in the future will be derived from transmission investments and activities ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if the ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected aep’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted management believes aep’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives aep an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp or other rtos will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to aep 

certain elements of aep’s transmission formula rates have been challenged which could result in lowered rates andor refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on aep’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows applies to all registrants other than aep texas 

aep provides transmission service under rates regulated by the ferc the ferc has approved the costbased formula rate templates used by aep to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates all aspects of aep’s rates accepted or approved by the ferc including the formula rate templates the rates of return on the actual equity portion 

of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures are subject to challenge by interested parties at the ferc or by the ferc on its own initiative in addition interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by aep of its projected rates and formula rate true up pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under aep’s formula rate implementation protocols if a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential then the ferc will make appropriate prospective adjustments to them andor disallow any of aep’s inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula 

in october 2016 several parties filed a complaint with the ferc claiming that the base roe used by certain aep subsidiaries that operate in pjm including the east transcos in calculating formula transmission rates under the pjm oatt is excessive and should be reduced from 1099 to 832 effective upon the date of the complaint in june 2017 a similar complaint was filed with the ferc claiming that the base roe used by certain aep subsidiaries that operate in spp including the west transcos in calculating formula transmission rates under the spp oatt is excessive and should be reduced from 107 to 836 effective upon the date of the complaint if the ferc orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint including refunds from the date of the complaint filing it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

enduse consumers and entities supplying electricity to enduse consumers may also attempt to influence government andor regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to aep particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially 

recent changes in federal income tax policy may adversely affect cash flows as well as credit ratings applies to all registrants 

recently enacted united states federal income tax legislation significantly changed the internal revenue code including taxation of corporations by among other things reducing the federal corporate income tax rate limiting interest deductions and altering the expensing of capital expenditures the legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the internal revenue service as well as state income tax authorities and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation will be subject to the discretion of the ferc and state public utility commissions 

although it is unclear when or how capital markets credit rating agencies the ferc or state public utility commissions may respond to this legislation management expects that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies such as funds from operationstodebt percentage could be negatively impacted in addition state public utility commissions have started to engage with aep’s utility subsidiaries to determine how any tax savings will be returned to customers management expects that aep’s utility subsidiaries will return the tax benefits to customers either through decreasing rates increasing the amortization of regulatory assets accelerating depreciation or offsetting other rate increases the amount and the timing of any payments of tax benefits to be returned to customers will ultimately be determined by the regulators 

management’s analysis and interpretation of this legislation is preliminary and ongoing based on management’s current evaluation limitations on interest deductions are not expected to be significant any amendments to the legislation or interpretations or implementing regulations by the irs contrary to management’s interpretation of the legislation could limit the ability to deduct the interest on some of the registrants’ outstanding debt 

there may be other material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that have not yet been identified if management is unable to successfully take actions to manage any adverse impacts of the new tax legislation or if additional interpretations regulations amendments or technical corrections exacerbate the adverse impacts of the legislation the legislation could have an adverse effect on the registrants’ financial condition results of operations and cash flows and on the value of investments in debt securities and common stock any negative actions by credit rating agencies may make it more costly to issue future debt securities and could increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities for additional information see note 4  rate matters and note 12  income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises applies to all registrants 

aep primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise this method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity 

  

aep may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects aep’s subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur in addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled 

aep is exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

im owns the cook plant which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2278  mws or about 7 of the generating capacity in the aep system aep and im are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants in addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the cook plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require aep or im to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs the ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

westinghouse and im have a number of significant ongoing contracts relating to reactor services nuclear fuel fabrication and ongoing engineering projects the most significant of these relate to cook plant fuel fabrication in march 2017 westinghouse filed a petition to reorganize under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code it intends to reorganize not cease business operations however at the current stage of the bankruptcy process it is unclear whether the company can successfully reorganize in january 2018 westinghouse issued a news release stating that it intends to sell all of its global business including the portion of the nuclear business that contracts with cook plant any sale would require approval by the bankruptcy court in the unlikely event westinghouse rejects im’s contracts or there is an interference with the sale process cook plant’s operations would be significantly impacted and potentially shut down temporarily as im seeks other vendors for these services 

the different regional power markets in which aep subsidiaries compete have changing market and transmission structures which could affect performance in these regions applies to all registrants 

results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business 

aep could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to all registrants 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject aep to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if aep were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards aep could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

a substantial portion of aep’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect aep’s cash flows financial condition and results of operations applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from reps that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers as of december 31 2017 aep texas did business with approximately 124 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments aep texas depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable puct regulations significantly limit the extent to which aep texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and aep texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort the puct enhanced the financial qualifications required of reps that began selling power after january 1 2009 and authorized utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in a future rate case in 2017 aep texas’ largest rep accounted for 18 of its operating revenue and its second largest rep accounted for 17 of its operating revenue any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments aep texas had received from such rep 

actual capital investment in the state transco’s may be lower than planned which would cause a lower than anticipated rate base and would therefore result in lower revenues and earnings compared to management’s current expectations applies to aep and aeptco 

each of the state transcos’ rate base revenues and earnings are determined in part by additions to property plant and equipment and when those additions are placed in service aeptco anticipates making significant capital investments over the next several years however the amounts could change significantly due to factors beyond its control if the state transcos’ capital investment and the resulting inservice property plant and equipment are lower than anticipated for any reason the state transcos will have a lower than anticipated rate base thus causing their revenue requirements and future earnings to be lower than anticipated 

changes in energy laws regulations or policies could impact aep’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows applies to all registrants 

each of the registrant subsidiaries is regulated by either the ferc as a “public utility” under federal law or the puct and is a transmission owner in ercot pjm or spp aep cannot predict whether the approved rate methodologies for any of the registrant subsidiaries will be changed in addition the us congress periodically considers enacting energy legislation that could assign new responsibilities to the ferc modify existing law or provide the ferc or another entity with increased authority to regulate transmission matters aep cannot predict whether and to what extent the registrant subsidiaries may be affected by any such changes in federal energy laws regulations or policies in the future while the registrant subsidiaries are subject to the puct’s or ferc’s exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of rate regulation changes in state laws affecting other matters such as transmission siting and construction could limit investment opportunities 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if aep is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions applies to all registrants 

performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission andor distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage aep’s reputation   applies to all registrants 

aep and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owneroperators of generation transmission andor distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading aep and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or aep operations could view these computer systems software or networks as targets for cyber attack in addition the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

  

a security breach of aep or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems interconnected entities in rtos or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject aep and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data a successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to aep’s reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions aep has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality integrity and availability of data and systems in addition aep is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements however cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt and as a result there is a risk that aep could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts 

if aep is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition applies to all registrants 

aep relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect aep’s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies such as aep that rely on fossil fuels if sources of capital for aep are reduced capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

downgrades in aep’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital applies to all registrants 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review aep’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to aep and could limit access to funding for operations aep’s business is capital intensive and aep is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive if aep’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained aep’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

aep’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions applies to all registrants 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition in addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning applies to all registrants and to aep and im with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning 

the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets discount rates the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan changes in actuarial assumptions future government regulation changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of aep’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and aep could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations additionally im holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant the rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations applies to all registrants 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business if aep is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in the price of commodities emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase aep’s cost of producing power impacting financial performance applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel including coal and gas and the price and availability to transport fuel aep has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel but as these contracts end or if they are not honored aep may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances aep uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures as long as current environmental programs remain in effect aep has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa attempts to further reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if aep needs to obtain allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs aep’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past changes in the cost of fuel emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are marked to market they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change applies to all registrants 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require aep to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of the aep service territory could also have an impact on revenues aep buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on aep’s own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as aep buys shortterm energy to serve aep’s own system which would increase the cost of energy aep provides to customers 

severe weather impacts aep’s service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes floods and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases this could increase aep’s cost of providing service changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact aep’s ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy aep may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact revenues aep’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies aep serves the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the aep system 

management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to aep’s business activities applies to all registrants 

aep is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6  of the notes to financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services applies to aep and aep texas 

aep texas transmits and distributes electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 

hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of aep’s operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties applies to all registrants 

aep operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime equipment interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks the hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties aep maintains property and casualty insurance but aep is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to aep’s business such as damage to poles towers and lines or losses caused by outages 

management is considering strategic alternatives for a portion of interest in the oklaunion power station and may incur losses as a result applies to aep aep texas and pso 

management is evaluating strategic alternatives for the respective interests of aep texas and pso in the oklaunion power station aepep also has interest in the oklaunion power station through its ppa with aep texas in which aepep receives the entire output of aep texas’ share of the oklaunion power station through december 2027 management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives nor have they set a specific timeframe for a decision certain of these alternatives could result in an impairment a loss andor could reduce future net income and cash flow and harm financial condition 

aeptco depends on its affiliates in the aep system for a substantial portion of its revenues applies to aeptco 

aeptco’s principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the aep system management expects that these affiliates will continue to be aeptco’s principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future for the year ended december 31 2017 its affiliates were responsible for approximately 80 of the consolidated transmission revenues of   aeptco 

most of the real property rights on which the assets of aeptco are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates applies to aeptco 

aeptco does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located instead under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective aep system utility affiliate that overlay its operations the ability of aeptco to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates which may be encumbered by easements mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property aep can give no assurance that a the relevant aep system utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of aeptco b suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant aep system utility affiliates are not its affiliates and c the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit aeptco to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety a majority of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires aep to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all aep facilities and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life costs of compliance 

with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated although aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions there can be no assurance that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

regulation of co 2  emissions could materially increase costs to aep and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in 2014 the federal epa issued standards for new modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units the standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015 and have been challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders the us supreme court has stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources known as the clean power plan until a final decision is issued by the courts in 2017 the federal epa issued a proposal to repeal the clean power plan and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking information that should be considered in the development of new emission guidelines 

co 2  standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of aep’s coalfired units aep typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential co 2  and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order aep to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which aep among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against aep substantial modifications of aep’s existing coalfired power plants could be required and aep might be required to limit or reduce emissions such remedies could require aep to purchase power from third parties to fulfill aep’s commitments to supply power to aep customers this could have a material impact on costs in addition aep could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in aep jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis without such recovery those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

aep’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or decline in customer demand applies to all registrants 

growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of aep such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity 

certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to further reduce energy consumption additionally technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption some or all of these factors could impact the demand for electricity 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated applies to all registrants except aep texas aeptco and opco 

aep routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by aep resulting from the management of aep’s trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position 

aep’s power trading activities also expose aep to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that aep’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls aep would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

in connection with these trading activities aep routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose aep to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner aep does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations 

parties with whom aep has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm aep’s results of operations applies to all registrants 

aep sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis aep also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations aep is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe aep money or the delivery of a commodity including power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform aep may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed aep’s contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and aep might incur losses although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

aep relies on electric transmission facilities that aep does not own or control if these facilities do not provide aep with adequate transmission capacity aep may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of aep’s power applies to all registrants 

aep depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power aep sells at wholesale this dependence exposes aep to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate aep may not be able to sell and deliver aep wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate aep’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

ovec may require additional liquidity and other capital support applies to aep apco im and opco 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies own ovec the intercompany power agreement icpa defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it under the icpa parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 if a party fails to make payments owed by it under the icpa ovec may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness ovec has outstanding indebtedness of approximately 14 billion 

in late 2016 a nonaffiliated party to the icpa announced its intention to exit its merchant business and that it may pursue restructuring or bankruptcy this party’s aggregate power participation ratio is approximately 8 under the icpa presently this party has yet to pursue restructuring or bankruptcy however as a result of this announcement and other related developments moody’s downgraded ovec’s rating with a negative outlook for possible downgrade while fitch and sp have revised ovec’s outlook to negative 

if ovec does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations there is risk that apco im andor opco may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments further if ovec’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that apco im andor opco may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347 also as a result of the credit rating agencies’ actions ovec’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs may rise

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the aep system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio tennessee texas virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines aep has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which aep’s operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission distribution generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 6 billion of construction expenditures for 2018  estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather and the ability to access capital for additional information on aep’s construction program see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2017  annual reports under the heading entitled budgeted construction expenditures

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2016  annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test in addition the acceleration of aep’s payment obligations or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under these credit agreements as of december 31 2016  aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before 

termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2016  annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

operations for aep subsidiaries are subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule the standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a sitespecific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the us court of appeals for the second circuit and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court 

in november 2015 the federal epa issued a final rule to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s national pollutant discharge elimination system program for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues 

coal ash regulation 

aep’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials effective october 2015 the federal epa adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the final rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule spanning approximately four years after publication of the final rule in the federal register if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuescoal combustion residual rule 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting aep’s power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

aep has made significant longterm investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants between 2000 and 2016  aep invested approximately 85 billion in environmental controls primarily related to caa that have significantly reduced emissions from 2001 and including projections through 2017  aep expects its emissions of mercury will be lower by approximately 8300 pounds a reduction of approximately 87 since 1990 and including projections through 2017  aep expects its emissions of so 2 and no x  will be lower by approximately 1460000 tons and 560000 tons respectively a reduction of approximately 94 and 89 respectively 

the acid rain program 

the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2  emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2  emissions of 89 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010 the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x  emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2  capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs aep continues to meet its obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2  and no x  emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many aep facilities additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities 

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25  standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new rule was signed by the administrator in december 2012 that lowered the annual standard a new ozone standard was adopted in 2015 the federal epa also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2  in 2010 a lower standard for no x  in 2010 and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2016 the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011 the states are in the process of developing new sips for the so 2  pm 25  and ozone standards which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on aep facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which required additional reductions in so 2  and no x  emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs in august 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that contains more stringent requirements to control so 2  and no x  emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 27 states and the district of columbia petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and csapr was vacated that decision was subsequently reversed by the us supreme court and remanded back to the us court of appeals for further proceedings the federal epa filed a motion to lift the stay and allow phase i of csapr to take effect on january 1 2015 and phase ii to take effect on january 1 2017 the court granted the federal epa’s motion an interim final rule has been issued and the court has remanded certain state budgets to federal epa for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect federal epa has proposed more stringent no x  budgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season for additional information regarding csapr see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

hazardous air pollutants 

as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants petitions for review of the mact standards were denied by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit but in 2014 the us supreme court determined that federal epa acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units federal epa has issued a supplemental finding and the rule remains in effect for additional information regarding mact see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso executed a settlement with the federal epa and the state of oklahoma to comply with regional haze program requirements in oklahoma and the settlement is now codified in the oklahoma sip pso is in the process of implementing the requirements of the sip federal epa has disapproved portions of the arkansas and texas sips and finalized a federal implementation plan for arkansas in 2016 for additional information regarding cavr and the regional haze program requirements see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

climate change 

aep has taken action to reduce and offset co 2  emissions from its generating fleet and expects co 2  emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities aep’s total projected co 2  emissions in 2017  not including emissions from the kyger creek and clifty creek plants are approximately 90 million metric tons a 46 reduction from aep’s 2000 co 2  emissions of approximately 167 million metric tons federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2  emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the caa the federal epa published the clean power plan in october 2015 such actions including the clean power plan are being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain in february 2016 the us supreme court issued a stay on the final clean power plan including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans the stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the us supreme court considers any petition for review    for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co 2  emissions including the clean power plan see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclimate change co 2  regulation and energy policy 

management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as aep diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals management’s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying aep’s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support 

aep’s fossil fuelfired generating units are large sources of co 2  emissions if substantial additional co 2  emission reductions are required there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units to the extent additional investments are made to reduce co 2  emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase rates return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings prudently incurred capital investments made by aep subsidiaries in rateregulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment management would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements however requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can have adverse effects because regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that aep would recover through higher rates for sales of energy into competitive markets however there is no such recovery mechanism 

renewable sources of energy 

the states aep serves other than kentucky west virginia and tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources 

at the end of 2016  the aep operating companies had longterm contracts for 2630 mws of wind and 10 mws of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers in addition im completed construction of four solar projects that make up im’s 147 mw clean energy solar pilot project cespp that was approved by the indiana utility regulatory commission this resulted in a total of 2655 mws of wind and solar inservice serving aep’s regulated utilities management actively manages aep’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

the growth of aep’s renewable portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both energy and capacity needs in addition to gradually reducing aep’s reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps aep to maintain a diversity of generation resources 

the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by aep’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect aep’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world the company has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources transmission assets of the aep system interconnect approximately 9000 mws of renewable energy resources of third parties and aep’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources 

aep energy supply llc owns 311 mws of wind capacity in texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market in 2016 aep took several major steps in executing its strategic plan to develop and market a merchant distributed resource portfolio aep renewables llc was formed in april 2016 to develop andor acquire large scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with credit worthy counterparties in 2016 aep renewables llc brought into service a 26 mw solar project in utah the company also owns a 62 mw solar project in nevada that was brought into service in 2017

beginning in 2008 aep ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available since that time aep operating companies have implemented over 125 programs across the aep service territory and in most of the states aep serves for the period 2008 through 2016  these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 60 million megawatt hours and peak demand by approximately 2000 mws aep estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 1 billion during that period to achieve these levels 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states aep serves and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for aep operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments as aep continues to transition to a cleaner more efficient energy future energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers 

aep believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a costeffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of aep’s strategic plan the board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets the board of directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about the company’s environmental financial and social performance 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2016  annual reports under the heading entitled the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation for further information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2014  2015  and 2016  and the current estimate for 2017  are shown below these investments include both environmental as well as other related spending estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generation plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2016 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system aep typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions for aep’s merchant generation units however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled environmental issues and note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2016  annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 



 

management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals the following cost estimates for periods following 2017  will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the federal epa provides flexibility in the final rules these cost estimates will also change based on a the states’ implementation of these regulatory programs including the potential for state implementation plans sips or federal implementation plans fips that impose more stringent standards b additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions c the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units d changes in costs for new pollution controls e new generating technology developments f total mws of capacity retired replaced or sold including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and g other factors 

for the registrant subsidiaries excluding opco management’s current ranges of estimates of environmental investments beginning in 2018  exclusive of debt afudc are set forth below 



business segments 

aep’s reportable segments 

aep’s primary business is the generation transmission and distribution of electricity within its vertically integrated utilities segment aep centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of costbased rates and regulatory oversight intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements 

aep’s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below 

vertically integrated utilities 

 

transmission and distribution utilities 

 

aep transmission holdco 

 

generation  marketing 

 

the remainder of aep’s activities is presented as corporate and other while not considered a reportable segment corporate and other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain aep utility subsidiaries parent’s guarantee revenue received from affiliates investment income interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs with the sale of aepro in november 2015 the activities related to the aep river operations segment have been moved to corporate and other for the periods presented see “aepro corporate and other” section of note 7  for additional information 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2016  aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23000 mws of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type including wind purchase agreements on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2016  fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities remained flat on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2015  

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2016  decreased from 2015  due to the decreased demand for coalfired generation resulting from low natural gas prices and the retirement of northeastern 4 and welsh 2 in 2016 coal inventories ended the year at abovetarget levels on a system basis 

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 3722 railcars approximately 468 barges 12 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in aep generating facilities 

spot market prices for coal started to strengthen in the second half of 2016  the increased spot coal prices reflect tighter supplies and increased demand for export coal as of december 31 2016  slightly less than half of the coal purchased by aep’s subsidiaries was procured through term contracts as those contracts expire or reopen for price adjustments needed tonnage is replaced at current market prices as necessary the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods the price paid for coal delivered in 2016  remained relatively flat from the prior year 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2016  the vertically integrated utilities coal inventory was approximately 42 days of full load burn while inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the vertically integrated utilities is approximately 30 days 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed approximately 104 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2016  for generating power this represents an increase of 16 from 2015  total gas consumption for the vertically integrated utilities was higher year over year due to lower natural gas prices in the first half of 2016 and the addition of clinch river units 1 and 2 and big sandy unit 1 as gas retrofitted units during the second quarter of 2016 several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate aep’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis im completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012 which consisted of 12 casks 32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each the second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015 which consisted of 16 casks the third dry cask loading is expected to occur in 2018 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015 the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant was 16 billion in 2015 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2016  the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 19 billion the balance of funds available to eventually decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections aep will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections see note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies included in the 2016  annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility 

counterparty risk management 

the vertically integrated utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants as a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2016  counterparties posted approximately 9 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   57 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2016  annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

certain power agreements 

im 

the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant have expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 under the intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mws in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the intercompany power agreement terminates in june 2040 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests ovec financed capital expenditures totaling 13 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances both ovec generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service opco attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the intercompany power agreement to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by ohio law opco failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of ovec and therefore filed a request with the puco seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of ovec in december 2013 the puco approved opco’s request subject to the condition that energy from the ovec entitlements are sold into the dayahead or realtime pjm energy markets or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangemen t in november 2016 the puco approved opco’s request to approve a costbased pur chased power agreement ppa rider effective in january 2017 that would initially be based upon opco’s contractual entitlement under the intercompany agreement which is approximately 20 of ovec’s capacity some parties filed a rehearing challenge to the puco decision which was denied separately opco filed a proposal to replace the ppa rider with a bypassable rate mechanism that involves serving nonshopping load with the ovec contractual entitlement which remains pending at this time 

electric delivery 

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with pjm and spp and as approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – competition 

transmission agreement 

apco im kgpco kpco and wpco own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the pjm oatt and are parties to the ta opco a subsidiary in aep’s transmission and distribution utilities segment is also a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by pjm the ta has been approved by the ferc 

tca oatt and ercot protocols 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to the tca under the tca a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of a overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement including the performance of transmission planning studies b the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and c compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff pursuant to the tca aepsc has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the oatt on behalf of the other parties to the agreement the tca also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the oatt these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp 

regional transmission organizations 

aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm and pso and swepco are members of the spp both fercapproved rtos rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not 

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management is actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4  to the financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2016  annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates currently frozen approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a combined costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates and aep has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at ferc the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers in addition the ferc regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets ferc order 2000 prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of aep’s public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

competition 

the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers federal policy generally fosters competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market and mandates that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result more generators participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs reliability of service and availability of capacity and power 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they currently maintain a competitive position 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness 

while the adoption rate of distributed generation in aep’s service areas has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country aep’s vertically integrated utility companies are focused on providing customers with more choices by working with regulators and policymakers to expand and potentially accelerate renewable energy offerings such additional customer choices consider not only longterm cost but are also focused on expanding resource diversity this includes proposed new revenue structures that enable deployment of advanced technologies and resources in 2015 aep formed an enterprise technology council to develop and deploy new programs and services designed to receive regulatory support the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and their ability to costeffectively deploy advanced technologies such as solar on a large scale place them in a favorable competitive position 

in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated   subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation   or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity these events could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life aep typically recovers undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs each including a return from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep work with such customers to meet their business needs for example various offpeak or interruptible supply options may be provided pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep also work with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources depending on the jurisdiction customers may have access to green power tariffs in other instances aep purchases renewable power that is available to all customers in a specific jurisdiction 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aep texas and opco opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1472000  retail customers in ohio aep texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1024000 retail customers through reps in west central and southern texas 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the puct for aep texas and by the puco and the ferc for opco the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies

aep transmission holdco aepthco 

general 

aepthco is a holding company for a aeptco which is the direct holding company for the state transcos and b aep’s transmission joint ventures 

aeptco 

aeptco wholly owns the state transcos 

 

the state transcos are independent of but respectively overlay the following of aep’s existing electric utility operating companies apco im kpco kgpco opco pso swepco and wpco the state transcos develop own operate and maintain their respective transmission assets assets of the state transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and unaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of pjm and spp aptco imtco ktco ohtco and wvtco are located within pjm oktco and swtco are located within spp 

imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco have received all necessary approvals for formation and currently own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions in december 2016 the virginia scc and wvpsc granted consent for apco and aptco to enter into a joint license agreement that will support aptco investment in the state of tennessee an application for regulatory approval for swtco is under consideration in louisiana 

the state transcos are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by ferc and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems the state transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with ferc the rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed return on equity these rates are then included in oatt for spp and pjm 

the state transcos own operate maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability grid security safety reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets a key part of aep’s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities assets and components of the existing aep system as needed to maintain reliability 

the state transcos provide the capability to replace and upgrade existing facilities the state transcos are geographically diverse and have assets in service or under construction across two rtos and in six states with additional states planned or pending approval as of december 31 2016  the state transcos had 41 billion of transmission assets inservice with plans to construct approximately  44 billion of additional transmission assets through 2019 management anticipates the need for extensive additional investment in transmission infrastructure within pjm and spp to maintain the required level of grid reliability resiliency security and efficiency and to address an aging transmission infrastructure management also foresees the need to construct additional transmission facilities based on changes in generating resources such as wind or solar projects generation additions or retirements and additional new customer interconnections aep will continue its investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid 

aepthco joint venture initiatives 

aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america transmission joint ventures 

the transmission joint ventures currently include 





 

aep’s joint ventures do not have employees business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and other aep subsidiaries and the joint venture partners during 2016  approximately 598 aepsc employees and 292 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures 

regulation 

the state transcos and the transmission joint ventures located outside of ercot establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to fercapproved implementation protocols the protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated 

the state transcos’ and the transmission joint ventures’ where applicable rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system the ferc requires transmission providers such as pjm and spp to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis 

the fercapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement atrr and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with ferc the formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous year’s billings allowing for overunderrecovery of the transmission owner’s atrr pjm and spp pay the transmission owners their atrr for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatt for the service taken 

the formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 1149 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity for aptco imtco ktco ohtco and wvtco oktco and swtco are allowed a return on equity of 112 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity the authorized returns on equity for the state transcos are commensurate with the fercauthorized returns on equity in the pjm and spp oatts respectively for aep’s utility subsidiaries 

in october 2016 several parties filed a joint complaint with ferc claiming the base return on common equity used by various aep affiliates in calculating formula transmission rates under the pjm oatt is excessive and should be reduced from 1099 to 832 effective upon the date of the complaint in november 2016 aep affiliates filed an application with the ferc to modify the ferc formula transmission rate calculation including adjustments for certain tax issues and a switch from historic to estimated expenses with a proposed effective date of january 1 2017 the rates will be implemented based upon the date provided in the pending ferc order subject to refund 

in the annual rate base filings described above the state transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of 32 billion in 2016  23 billion for 2015  and 14 billion for 2014  the total transmission revenue requirement filed in the atrr including prior year overunderrecovery of revenue and associated carrying charges for 2016  2015  and 2014  was 555 million 363 million and 231 million respectively 

the rates of ett which is located in ercot are determined by the puct ett sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim transmission costs of services tcos filings ett may file interim tcos filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital 

effective march 2017 the transmission joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 96 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 

generation  marketing 

general 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business the largest subsidiary in the generation  marketing segment is agr through year end 2016  agr owned 6752 mws of generating capacity with rights to an additional 1186 mws pursuant to a unit power agreement see below in january 2017 agr sold 4143 mws of generation capacity to an unaffiliated third party and terminated the 1186 mw unit power agreement as a result of the sale agr currently owns 2732 mws of generating capacity other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

with respect to wholesale energy trading and marketing business aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries enter into shortterm and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ercot spp miso and pjm these subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities 

these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent overthecounter swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to the retail supply and energy management business aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity andor natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides various energy solutions in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had approximately 430000 customer accounts as of december 31 2016  

aep energy supply llc owns 311 mws of wind capacity in texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market in 2016 aep took several major steps in executing its strategic plan to develop and market a merchant distributed resource portfolio aep renewables llc was formed in april 2016 to develop andor acquire large scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with credit worthy counterparties in 2016 aep renewables llc brought into service a 26 mw solar project in utah the company also owns a 62 mw solar project in nevada that was brought into service in 2017 

aep onsite partners llc works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities the company targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers aep onsite partners llc pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers and appropriate agreements as of december 31 2016  aep onsite partners llc owned projects operating in six states including 15 mws of installed solar capacity and another 21 mws of solar projects under construction in five states 

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of utilities including agr which is a public utility as defined by the ferc and set costbased rates if ferc subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions periodically agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies agr is also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of ferc 

competition 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation because most of agr’s remaining generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s generation  marketing segment agr also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of agr’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive 

in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity these events could cause agr to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life 

changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the united states including those served by the generation  marketing segment industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the generation  marketing segment works with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options the generation  marketing segment also works with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the generation  marketing segment not including agr’s ownership of the oklaunion generating unit 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels 

coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units agr through its contracts with third party transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities agr plants consumed 104 million tons of coal in 2016  

the coal supplies at agr plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries agr aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn as of december 31 2016  the coal inventory of agr was above target 

natural gas 

despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply the us pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gasfired generation a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate agr plants consumed 100 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2016  an increase of approximately 87 from 2015  

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2016  counterparties posted approximately 19 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation  marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately   142 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2016  annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

certain power agreements 

as of december 31 2016  the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 mws of companyowned domestic wind power facilities 177 mws of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 355 mws of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers the interest of aep texas in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to other disclosures within this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other documents filed with the sec from time to time the following factors should be considered in evaluating the registrants such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought as indicated below many of the following risk factors apply to aep and several or all of the registrant subsidiaries and accordingly such risk factors should be read to include the applicable registrants 

general risks of regulated operations and state restructuring 

aep may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives aep’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected aep subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their planned extensive investment this would cause financial results to be diminished 

regulated electric revenues earnings and results are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit aep’s ability to recover costs and other amounts applies to all registrants 

the rates customers pay to aep regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia in certain instances aep’s applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval aep cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the ferc or the respective state commissions in establishing rates 

if regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost including fuel and related costs generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved see note 4  of the notes to consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters for information regarding rate proceedings 

aep’s transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities applies to all registrants 

management expects that a growing portion of aep’s earnings in the future will be derived from transmission investments and activities ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected aep’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted management believes aep’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives aep an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp or other rtos will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to aep 

in october 2016 several parties filed a joint complaint with the ferc claiming that the base return on common equity used by various aep affiliates in calculating formula transmission rates under the pjm open access transmission tariff oatt is excessive and should be reduced from 1099  to 832  effective upon the date of the complaint if the ferc orders revenue reductions as a result of the complaint including refunds from the date of the complaint filing it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

if the ferc were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for aep’s transmission investments and facilities or if one or more states were to successfully limit ferc jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises applies to all registrants 

  

aep primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise this method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity this occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output and could adversely affect aep’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could also result in an impairment of certain longlived assets 

  

aep may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects aep and its subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur in addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled 

aep is exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im aep owns the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mws or about 7 of the generating capacity in the aep system aep and im are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants in addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the cook plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require aep or im to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs the ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

the different regional power markets in which aep subsidiaries compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect performance in these regions applies to all registrants 

results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business 

aep could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to all registrants 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject aep 

to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if aep were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards aep could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

aep may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy applies to all registrants 

aep is impacted by the united states federal income tax policy including corporate income tax laws both the new federal administration and the republicans in the house of representatives have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform including significant changes to the united states corporate income tax laws management is currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on aep a reduction in the federal statutory tax rate could result in an accelerated return of deferred federal income taxes to customers this and other changes in the united states federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on cash flow financial condition and liquidity 

collection of revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps applies to aep 

revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity aep distributes to rep customers currently aep does business with approximately one hundred reps in 2016  aep texas’ largest rep accounted for 18 of its operating revenue its second largest rep accounted for 18 of its operating revenue and its third largest rep accounted for 10 of its operating revenue adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for services or cause them to delay such payments aep depends on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if aep is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions applies to all registrants 

performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission and distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage aep’s reputation   applies to all registrants 

aep and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owneroperators of generation transmission and distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading aep and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or aep operations could view these computer systems software or networks as targets for cyber attack in addition the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

  

a security breach of aep or its regulated utility businesses’ physical assets or information systems aep’s competitors interconnected entities in rtos and isos or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject aep and its regulated utility businesses to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data a successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to aep’s reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions aep has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality integrity and availability of data and systems in addition aep is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements however cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt and as a result there is a risk that aep could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts 

if aep is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition applies to all registrants 

aep relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect aep’s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness certain sources of debt and equity capital expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies such as aep that rely on fossil fuels if sources of capital for aep disappear capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

downgrades in aep’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital andor to operate the power trading businesses applies to all registrants 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review aep’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to aep and could limit access to funding for operations aep’s business is capital intensive and aep is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive if aep’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained aep’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep’s power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of aep’s individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt or on the investment grade ratings of aep most counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade aep’s ability to operate the power trading business profitably would be diminished because aep would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

aep’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions applies to all registrants 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that aep enters into in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition in addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning applies to all registrants and to aep and im with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning 

the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets discount rates the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan changes in actuarial assumptions future government regulation changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of aep’s required or voluntary contributions made to the plans changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and aep could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations additionally im holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant the rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations applies to all registrants 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business if aep is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in the price of commodities emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase aep’s cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from selling power impacting financial performance applies to all registrants 

aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal aep has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal but as these contracts end or if they are not honored aep may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances aep uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures as long as current environmental programs remain in effect aep has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa attempts to further reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if aep needs to obtain allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs aep’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

aep also owns natural gasfired facilities which exposes aep to market prices of natural gas historically natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources recently however the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility aep’s ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to aep’s sales prices so the margins realized from sales will be lower and on occasion aep may need to curtail operation of marginal plants management expects the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a longterm material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are marked to market they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change applies to all registrants 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require aep to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of the aep service territory could also have an impact on revenues aep buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on aep’s own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as aep buys shortterm energy to serve aep’s own system which would increase the cost of energy aep provides to customers 

severe weather impacts aep’s service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes floods and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases this could increase aep’s cost of providing service changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact aep’s ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy aep may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact revenues aep’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies aep serves the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the aep system 

management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to aep’s business activities applies to all registrants 

aep is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6  of the notes to financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant applies to all registrants 

operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 82 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires aep to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all aep facilities and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life these expenditures have been significant in the past and management expects that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated although aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions there can be no assurance that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition for aep’s sales of energy from competitive units there is no such costrecovery mechanism as a result aep may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down the costs of compliance for aep’s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

regulation of co 2  emissions could materially increase costs to aep and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to all registrants 

in 2014 the federal epa issued standards for new modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development 

of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units the standards and guidelines were finalized in 2015 and have been challenged by several dozen states as well as industry groups and other stakeholders the us supreme court has stayed the implementation of the guidelines for existing sources known as the clean power plan until a final decision is issued by the courts 

co 2  standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of aep’s coalfired units aep typically recovers costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential co 2  and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions for aep’s sales of energy into the markets however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs should they arise could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order aep to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions applies to all registrants 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which aep among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against aep substantial modifications of aep’s existing coalfired power plants could be required and aep might be required to limit or reduce emissions such remedies could require aep to purchase power from third parties to fulfill aep’s commitments to supply power to aep customers this could have a material impact on costs in addition aep could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in aep jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis without such recovery those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

aep’s results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or decline in customer demand or number of customers applies to all registrants 

growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of aep such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity 

certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to further reduce energy consumption additionally technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption some or all of these factors could impact the demand for electricity 

profitability is impacted by aep’s continued authorization to sell power at marketbased rates applies to all registrants 

ferc has granted agr apco im kpco opco pso and swepco authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates ferc reserves the right to revoke or revise this marketbased rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions each company that has obtained marketbased rate authority from ferc must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for marketbased rates the loss of marketbased rate authority by any of these entities especially by agr could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 

revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond aep’s control applies to all registrants 

aep sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis aep also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in regional markets and competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time sales margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price aep can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce margins and therefore diminish revenues and results of operations volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated applies to all registrants 

the exposure of aep’s power trading activities is managed by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result management cannot predict the impact that aep’s energy trading and risk management decisions may have on aep’s business operating results or financial position 

aep routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by aep resulting from the management of aep’s trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position 

aep’s power trading risk management activities including power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be impacted if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

aep’s power trading activities also expose aep to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that aep’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls aep would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

in connection with these trading activities aep routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose aep to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner aep does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations 

parties with whom aep has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm aep’s results of operations applies to all registrants 

aep is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe aep money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform aep may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed aep’s contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and aep might incur losses although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

aep relies on electric transmission facilities that aep does not own or control if these facilities do not provide aep with adequate transmission capacity aep may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of aep’s power applies to all registrants 

aep depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power aep sells at wholesale this dependence exposes aep to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate aep may not be able to sell and deliver aep wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate aep’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

ovec may require additional liquidity and other capital support applies to aep apco im and opco 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies own ovec the intercompany power agreement icpa defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it under the icpa parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 if a party fails to make payments owed by it under the icpa ovec may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness ovec has outstanding indebtedness of approximately 15 billion 

recently a nonaffiliated party to the icpa announced its intention to exit its merchant business and that it may pursue restructuring or bankruptcy this party’s aggregate power participation ratio is approximately 8 under the icpa as a result of this announcement and other related developments moody’s downgraded ovec’s rating and left them on negative outlook for possible downgrade fitch revised ovec’s outlook to negative while sp affirmed ovec’s rating and stable outlook 

if ovec does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations there is risk that apco im andor opco may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments further if ovec’s indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that apco im andor opco may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347 also as a result of the moody’s and fitch actions ovec’s ability to access capital markets on terms as favorable as previously may diminish and its financing costs may rise

title to property 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the aep system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio tennessee texas virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines aep has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which aep’s operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission distribution generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 57 billion of construction expenditures for 2017  estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather and the ability to access capital for additional information on aep’s construction program see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2016  annual reports under the heading entitled budgeted construction expenditures

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand borrowing under aep’s revolving credit agreements and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2015  annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test in addition the acceleration of aep’s payment obligations or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under these credit agreements as of december 31 2015  aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before 

termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2015  annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

operations for aep subsidiaries are subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule the standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a sitespecific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the us court of appeals for the second circuit and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court 

in november 2015 the federal epa issued a final rule to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s national pollutant discharge elimination system program for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues 

coal ash regulation 

aep’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials effective october 2015 the federal epa adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the final rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule spanning approximately four years after publication of the final rule in the federal register if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuescoal combustion residual rule 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting aep’s power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

aep has made significant longterm investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants between 2000 and 2015 aep invested approximately 81 billion in environmental controls primarily related to caa that have significantly reduced emissions during the same time period and including our projections through 2017 aep expects its emissions of mercury to have been reduced by approximately 85 since 1990 and including our projections through 2017 aep expects its emissions of so 2 and no x  to have been reduced by approximately 90 and 85 respectively 

the acid rain program 

the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2  emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2  emissions of 89 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010 the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x  emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2  capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs aep continues to meet its obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2  and no x  emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many aep facilities additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities 

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25  standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new rule was signed by the administrator in december 2012 that lowered the annual standard a new ozone standard was adopted in 2015 the federal epa also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2  in 2010 a lower standard for no x  in 2010 and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2014 the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011 the states are in the process of developing new sips for the so 2  pm 25  and ozone standards which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on aep facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which required additional reductions in so 2  and no x  emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs in august 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that contains more stringent requirements to control so 2  and no x  emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 27 states and the district of columbia petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and csapr was vacated that decision was subsequently reversed by the us supreme court and remanded back to the us court of appeals for further proceedings the federal epa filed a motion to lift the stay and allow phase i of csapr to take effect on january 1 2015 and phase ii to take effect on january 1 2017 the court granted the federal epa’s motion an interim final rule has been issued and the court has remanded certain state budgets to federal epa for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect federal epa has proposed more stringent no x  budgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season for additional information regarding csapr see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

hazardous air pollutants 

as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants petitions for review of the mact standards were denied by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit but in 2014 the us supreme court determined that federal epa acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units federal epa has issued a supplemental finding and the rule remains in effect for additional information regarding mact see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso is in the process of implementing a settlement with the federal epa in order to comply with the regional haze program requirements in oklahoma federal epa issued a proposed federal implementation plan for arkansas in 2015 for additional information regarding cavr and the regional haze program requirements see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

climate change 

aep has taken action to reduce and offset co 2  emissions from its generating fleet and expects co 2  emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities aep’s total co 2  emissions in 2015 not including emissions from the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately 1024 million metric tons a 30 reduction from aep’s 2005 co 2  emissions of approximately 146 million metric tons federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2  emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the caa for example the federal epa published the clean power plan in october 2015 such actions including the clean power plan are being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain in february 2016 the us supreme court issued a stay on the final clean power plan including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans the stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the us supreme court considers any petition for review    for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co 2  emissions including the clean power plan see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclimate change co 2  regulation and energy policy 

management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as aep diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals management’s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying aep’s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support 

aep’s fossil fuelfired generating units are large sources of co 2  emissions if substantial additional co 2  emission reductions are required there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units to the extent additional investments are made to reduce co 2  emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase rates return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings prudently incurred capital investments made by aep subsidiaries in rateregulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment management would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements however requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can have adverse effects because regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that aep would recover through higher rates for sales of energy into competitive markets however there is no such recovery mechanism 

renewable sources of energy 

all of the states aep serves other than kentucky and tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources 

at the end of 2015 the aep operating companies had longterm contracts for 20315 mw of wind and 101 mw of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers in addition im began construction on the first of four solar projects that will make up im’s 147 mw clean energy solar pilot project cespp that was approved by the indiana utility regulatory commission 599 mws of recentlycompleted wind projects under contract for pso were in service as of late 2015 and the remaining three projects associated with im’s cespp projects are expected to begin deliveries in 2016 this will result in a total of 26553 mw of wind and solar inservice for aep management actively manages aep’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

the growth of aep’s renewable portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both energy and capacity needs in addition to gradually reducing aep’s reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps aep to maintain a diversity of generation resources 

the clean power plan effectively establishes a renewable portfolio standard for each of aep’s states creating additional opportunities for renewable growth independent of the clean power plan the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by aep’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect aep’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world the company has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources transmission assets of the aep system interconnect approximately 7500 mw of renewable energy resources of third parties and aep’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources 

end use energy efficiency 

beginning in 2008 aep ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available since that time aep operating companies have implemented over 100 programs across the aep service territory and in most of the states aep serves for the period 2008 through 2015 these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 60 million megawatt hours and peak demand by over 1500 mw aep estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 875 million during that period to achieve these levels 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states aep serves and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for aep operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments the clean power plan could 

provide additional opportunities for energy efficiency if states develop implementation plans that require energy efficiency aep believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a costeffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans 

aep is also developing and marketing a merchant distributed resource portfolio aep’s newlyformed subsidiary onsite partners llc works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions based upon market knowledge technology innovations and deal structuring which may include distributed solar wind combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other forms of cost reducing energy technologies onsite partners llc pursues projects where a suitably termed power agreement is entered into with a creditworthy counterparty 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of aep’s strategic plan the board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements such as the clean power plan that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets the board of directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about the company’s environmental financial and social performance 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2015  annual reports under the heading entitled the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation for further information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2013 2014 and 2015 and the current estimate for 2016 are shown below afudc debt is included in the historical periods these investments include both environmental as well as other related spending estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generation plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2015 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous these estimates do not include any projected costs that might be triggered by compliance with the clean power plan the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system aep typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions for aep’s merchant generation units however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm aep’s financial condition see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled environmental issues and note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2015 annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 



 

management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals the following cost estimates for periods following 2016 will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the federal epa provides flexibility in the final rules these cost estimates will also change based on a the states’ implementation of these regulatory programs including the potential for state implementation plans sips or federal implementation plans fips that impose more stringent standards b additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions c the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units d changes in costs for new pollution controls e new generating technology developments f total mws of capacity retired replaced or sold including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and g other factors the following cost estimates do not include any projected costs that might be triggered by compliance with the clean power plan and are limited to only the costs of major projects to comply with existing air and water quality standards in addition management is continuing to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on both regulated and nonregulated plants 

for the registrant subsidiaries management’s current ranges of estimates of environmental investments beginning in 2017 exclusive of debt afudc are set forth below 



business segments 

aep’s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below see note 9  to the financial statements entitled business segments included in the 2015  annual reports for additional information on the operating segments 

vertically integrated utilities 

 

transmission and distribution utilities 

 

aep transmission holdco 

 

generation  marketing 

 

aep river operations 

 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2015  aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23600 mw of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

fuel supply 

the 2013 results include fuel used and transported by opco a utility subsidiary that is not part of the vertically integrated utilities segment opco’s results appear here because it retained its generation until yearend 2013 at which point all of its generation was transferred to agr which transferred portions to apco and kpco 

the table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2015 fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities decreased approximately 12 on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2014 this was due to a significant decline in natural gas prices along with a marginal decrease in coal prices 

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to a decrease in power prices and corresponding decrease in demand for coalfired generation as a result coal inventories ended the year at abovetarget levels on a system basis 

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 4838 railcars approximately 498 barges 12 towboats 8 harbor boats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in aep generating facilities 

spot market prices for coal continued to decrease throughout 2015 the decreased spot coal prices reflect the reduction in demand for coalfired generation and the oversupply in the market as of december 31 2015 slightly less than half of the coal purchased by aep was procured through term contracts as those contracts expire they are replaced 

with contracts at current market prices the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods the price paid for coal delivered in 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in spot coal prices and heavier reliance on shorter term contracts 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2015 the vertically integrated utilities coal inventory was approximately 47 days of full load burn while inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the vertically integrated utilities is approximately 30 days 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed over 89 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2015 for generating power this represents a decrease of 7 from 2014 while aep’s natural gasfired generating capacity has increased over the past several years with the addition of the stall and dresden units the implementation of the spp market and change in the dispatch of aep’s natural gas fleet resulted in a decreased natural gasfired generation several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate aep’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities results for 2013 include natural gas delivered to opco while results for 2015 and 2014 do not 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis im completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012 which consisted of 12 casks 32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each the second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015 which consisted of 16 casks the third dry cask loading is expected to occur in 2018 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015 the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant was 16 billion in 2015 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2015  the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 18 billion the balance of funds available to eventually decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections aep will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections see note 6  to the financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies included in the 2015  annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility 

counterparty risk management 

the vertically integrated utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants as a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2015  counterparties posted approximately 9 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   52 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2015  annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

certain power agreements 

im 

the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant have expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 under the intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2400 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the intercompany power agreement terminates in june 2040 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests ovec financed capital expenditures totaling 13 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances both ovec generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service opco attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the intercompany power agreement to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by ohio law opco failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of ovec and therefore filed a request with the puco seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of ovec in december 2013 the puco approved opco’s request subject to the condition that energy from the ovec entitlements are sold into the dayahead or realtime pjm energy markets or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangemen t opco has filed an application with the puco to approve a costbased purchased power agreement ppa rider that would initially be based upon opco’s contractual entitlement under the intercompany agreement which is approximately 20 of ovec’s capacity  

electric delivery 

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with pjm spp and ercot and as approved by the ferc see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 business – vertically integrated utilities – competition

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period 

of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management is actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4  to the financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2015  annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales the factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the period following when new annual factors are established 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a combined costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of aep’s public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc increased utility merger oversight 

competition 

the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers federal policy generally fosters competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market and mandates that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs reliability of service and availability of capacity and power 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they currently maintain a competitive position 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness 

while the adoption rate of distributed generation in aep’s service areas has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country aep’s vertically integrated utility companies are focused on providing customers with more choices by working with regulators and policymakers to expand and potentially accelerate renewable energy offerings such additional customer choices consider not only longterm cost but are also focused on expanding resource diversity this includes proposed new revenue structures that enable deployment of advanced technologies and resources in 2015 aep formed an enterprise technology council to develop and deploy new programs and services designed to receive regulatory support the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and their ability to costeffectively deploy advanced technologies such as solar on a large scale place them in a favorable competitive position 

in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated   subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation   or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity this occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output these events could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life if aep retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants aep typically recovers undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep work with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep also work with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources depending on the jurisdiction customers may have access to green power tariffs in other instances aep purchases renewable power that is available to all customers in a specific jurisdiction 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by opco tcc and tnc opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1468000  retail customers in ohio tcc is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 826000  retail customers through reps in southern texas tnc is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 189000  retail customers through reps in west and central texas 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the puct for tcc and tnc and by the puco and the ferc for opco the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business 

the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules protocols and agreements in place with pjm and ercot and as approved by the ferc in addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies

aep transmission holdco aepthco 

general 

aepthco is a holding company for a aeptco which is the direct holding company for the seven whollyowned fercregulated transmissiononly electric utilities transcos listed below each of which is geographically aligned with aep’s existing utility operating companies and b aep’s transmission joint ventures 

aeptco transcos 

aep east transmission companies  the “aep east transmission companies” all located within pjm 

 

aep west transmission companies  the “aep west transmission companies” all located within spp 

 

transmission development through the transcos is primarily driven by 

 24 

 

the transcos develop own and operate transmission assets that are physically connected to aep’s existing system they are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the ferc and employ a forwardlooking formula rate tariff design the transcos are independent of but overlay aep’s existing vertically integrated utility operating companies and the transmission operations of opco imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco have received approvals for formation or did not require state commission approval to operate imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco currently own and operate transmission assets an application for regulatory approval for swtco is under consideration in louisiana as of december 31 2015 aeptco’s subsidiaries had 28 billion of transmission assets inservice with plans to construct approximately 35 billion of additional transmission assets through 2018 

aepthco joint venture initiatives 

aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america 

aep is currently participating in the following joint venture initiatives 



 

aep’s joint ventures do not have employees business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and other aep subsidiaries and the joint venture partners during 2015 approximately 521 aepsc employees and 253 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures 

regulation 

the transcos and joint ventures located outside of ercot establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to fercapproved implementation protocols the protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated 

the transcos’ and joint ventures’ where applicable rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system the ferc requires transmission providers such as pjm and spp to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis 

the fercapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement atrr and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with ferc the formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous year’s billings allowing for overunderrecovery of the transmission owner’s atrr pjm and spp pay the transmission owners their atrr for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatt for the service taken 

the formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 1149 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity for the aep east transmission companies the aep west transmission companies are allowed a return on equity of 112 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity the authorized returns on equity for the transcos are commensurate with the fercauthorized returns on equity in the pjm and spp oatts respectively for aep’s utility subsidiaries 

in the annual rate base filings described above the transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of 23 billion in 2015 14 billion for 2014 and 776 million for 2013 the total transmission revenue requirement filed in the atrr including prior year overunderrecovery of revenue and associated carrying charges for 2015 2014 2013 and 2012 was 363 million 231 million 107 million and 34 million respectively 

the rates of ett which is located in ercot are determined by the puct ett sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim transmission costs of services tcos filings ett may file interim tcos filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital  in november 2015 the puct ordered ett to file a base rate case by february 2017 a base rate review could produce a refund if ett incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim tcos increase was based a refund of interim transmission rates would reduce future net income and cash flows management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring see note 4  to the financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2015 annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

aep’s joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 996 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 

competition 

one of the most significant provisions of ferc order no 1000 is the removal of the federal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities within tariffs and agreements for certain regional transmission projects historically vertically integrated public utilities had the right to build and own transmission lines proposed by the region’s planning processes when those lines connected to facilities within their respective retail service territories ferc order no 1000 eliminates the federal right of first refusal in rto tariffs for incumbent utilities to construct certain regional transmission projects within their own service territories thereby creating the opportunity for any qualified entity to build and own regional transmission facilities in any service territory transource was created to respond to ferc order no 1000 competitive processes at the rto level 

generation  marketing 

general 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business the largest subsidiary in the generation  marketing segment is agr agr owns 6752 mw of generating capacity with rights to an additional 1186 mw pursuant to a unit power agreement see below other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

with respect to wholesale energy trading and marketing business aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ercot spp miso and pjm these subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities 

these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent overthecounter swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to the retail supply and energy management business aep’s subsidiary aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had approximately 375000 customer accounts as of december 31 2015  

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of utilities including agr which is a public utility as defined by the ferc and set costbased rates if ferc subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions as a condition to the order granting agr marketbased rate authority every three years agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies agr is also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of ferc 

competition 

the aep generation  marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation because much of agr’s 

generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities 

technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for aep’s generation  marketing segment agr also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power 

changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of agr’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive 

while the adoption rate of distributed generation in areas that agr sells power has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country aep expects these trends to continue agr believes that the unit availability the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and its ability to costeffectively deploy advanced technologies such as solar on a large scale place it in a favorable competitive position 

in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity this occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output these events could cause agr to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life if agr retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that agr will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants and may be forced to shut down competitive units 

recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the united states including those served by the generation  marketing segment industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the generation  marketing segment works with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options the generation  marketing segment also works with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

fuel supply 

the table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation mwhs basis used by the generation and marketing segment not including the oklaunion generating unit 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels 

coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units agr through its contracts with third party transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities agr plants consumed 112 million tons of coal in 2015 

the coal supplies at agr plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries agr likes to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn as of december 31 2015 the coal inventory of agr was approximately 57 days of full load burn 

natural gas 

despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply the us pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gasfired generation a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate agr plants consumed 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2015 an increase of approximately 73 from 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to other disclosures within this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other documents filed with the sec from time to time the following factors should be considered in evaluating the registrants such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought as indicated below many of the following risk factors apply to aep and several or all of the registrant subsidiaries and accordingly such risk factors should be read to include the applicable registrants 

general risks of regulated operations 

aep may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives aep’s public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected aep subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their planned extensive investment this would cause financial results to be diminished 

regulated electric revenues earnings and results are dependent on state regulation that may limit aep’s ability to recover costs and other amounts applies to all registrants 

the rates customers pay to aep regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of ohio texas virginia west virginia oklahoma indiana louisiana kentucky arkansas michigan and tennessee if regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost including fuel and related costs generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved 

aep’s transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities applies to all registrants 

management expects that a growing portion of aep’s earnings in the future will be derived from the transmission investments and activities of aeptco and transmission joint ventures ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected aep’s strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted management believes aep’s experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives aep an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp or other rtos will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to aep if the ferc were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for aep’s transmission investments and facilities or if one or more states were to successfully limit ferc jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to all registrants 

aep’s business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects aep and its subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur in addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled 

aep is exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im aep owns the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or about 7 of the generating capacity in the aep system aep and im are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants in addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the cook plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require aep or im to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs the ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

the different regional power markets in which aep subsidiaries compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect performance in these regions applies to all registrants 

results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear management is unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on the business 

aep could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to all registrants 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject aep to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if aep were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards aep could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if aep is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions applies to all registrants 

performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission and distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage aep’s reputation   applies to all registrants 

aep owns assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run aep facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or aep operations could view aep’s computer systems software or networks as targets for cyber attack in addition the business requires that aep collect and maintain sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

a successful cyber attack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to aep’s reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions aep has a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality integrity and availability of data and systems in addition aep is subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements however cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt and as a result there is a risk that aep could experience a successful cyber attack despite current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts 

if aep is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition applies to all registrants 

aep relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect aep’s ability to raise capital and fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition certain sources of debt and equity capital gave expressed increasing unwillingness to invest in companies such as aep that rely on fossil fuels if sources of capital for aep disappear capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

downgrades in aep’s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital andor to operate the power trading businesses applies to all registrants 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review aep’s capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to aep and could limit access to funding for operations aep’s business is capital intensive and aep is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive in periods of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if aep’s ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained aep’s interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep’s power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of aep’s individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt or on the investment grade ratings of aep most counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade aep’s ability to operate the power trading business profitably would be diminished because aep would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

aep’s operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions applies to all registrants 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that aep enters into in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition in addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations applies to all registrants 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business if aep is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in the price of commodities emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase aep’s cost of producing power or decrease the amount received from selling power impacting financial performance applies to all registrants 

aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal aep has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal but as these contracts end or if they are not honored aep may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly aep is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances aep uses emission allowances based on the amount of coal used as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures as long as current environmental programs remain in effect aep has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if aep needs to obtain allowances under a replacement rule those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs aep’s risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

aep also owns natural gasfired facilities which exposes aep to market prices of natural gas historically natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources recently however the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility aep’s ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to aep’s sales prices so the margins realized from sales will be lower and on occasion aep may need to curtail operation of marginal plants management expects the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a longterm material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are marked to market they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change applies to all registrants 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require aep to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of the aep service territory could also have an impact on revenues aep buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on aep’s own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as aep buys shortterm energy to serve aep’s own system which would increase the cost of energy aep provides to customers 

severe weather impacts aep’s service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes floods and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases this could increase aep’s cost of providing service changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact aep’s ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy aep may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact revenues aep’s financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies aep serves the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the aep system 

management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to aep’s business activities applies to all registrants 

aep is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6  of the notes to financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

risks relating to state restructuring 

collection of revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps applies to aep 

revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity aep distributes to rep customers currently aep does business with approximately one hundred reps in 2015 tcc’s largest rep accounted for 23 of its operating revenue and its second largest rep accounted for 22 of its operating revenue tnc’s largest rep accounted for 11 of its operating revenues and its second largest rep accounted for 10 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for services or cause them to delay such payments aep depends on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant applies to all registrants 

operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires aep to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all aep facilities and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life these expenditures have been significant in the past and management expects that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated if aep retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition for aep’s merchant generation units there is no such costrecovery mechanism as a result aep may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down the costs of compliance for aep’s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

regulation of co 2  emissions could materially increase costs to aep and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to all registrants 

in 2015 the federal epa issued final co 2 emissions standards for new power generation sources and final emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel fired electric generating units the standards for new coalfired generating units are based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage the standards for natural gas combined cycle units are based on the use of efficient combined cycle generating technology the clean power plan guidelines for existing sources include aggressive emission rate goals that are composed of a number of measures and seek nationwide reductions of co 2 emissions of approximately 32 from 2005 levels by 2030 the clean power plan is intended to be implemented pursuant to individual state plans beginning in 2022 in february 2016 the us supreme court issued a stay on the final clean power plan including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans the stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and the us supreme court considers any petition for review    all of the final requirements are currently the subject of litigation in the federal courts 

co 2  standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could cause aep to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life if aep retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that aep will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants aep typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition for aep’s merchant generation units there is no such costrecovery mechanism as a result aep may not recover costs through the market and may be forced to shut competitive units down the costs of compliance for aep’s competitive units could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition 

aep’s financial performance may be adversely affected if the merchant generation fleet is not profitable or loses value applies to aep 

management is evaluating strategic alternatives for aep’s merchant generation fleet which primarily includes agr’s generation fleet which operates in pjm management has not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives nor have they set a specific timeframe for a decision certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flow and harm financial condition 

amounts aep receives from the results of pjm capacity auctions associated with nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate aep applies to aep 

financial returns on agr’s generation capacity are subject to the results of annual pjm capacity auctions auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity if the pjm capacity auctions result in clearing prices lower than the cost of aep’s capacity it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order aep to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions applies to all registrants 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which aep among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against aep substantial modifications of aep’s existing coalfired power plants could be required and aep might be required to limit or reduce emissions such remedies could require aep to purchase power from third parties to fulfill aep’s commitments to supply power to aep customers this could have a material impact on costs in addition aep could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in aep jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis without such recovery those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of generating facilities applies to all registrants 

aep primarily generates electricity at large central facilities this method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than a newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and b distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production the ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of aep’s competitiveness the costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive it is possible that advances in technologies the availability of distributed generation or changes in 

regulatory policies will lower the demand for electricity or reduce the costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production either of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 

further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity this occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output these events could adversely affect aep’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows and could also result in an impairment of certain longlived assets 

profitability is impacted by aep’s continued authorization to sell power at marketbased rates applies to all registrants 

ferc has granted agr apco im kpco opco pso and swepco authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates ferc reserves the right to revoke or revise this marketbased rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions each company that has obtained marketbased rate authority from ferc must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for marketbased rates the loss of marketbased rate authority by any of these entities especially by agr could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 

revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond aep’s control applies to all registrants 

aep sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis aep also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in regional markets and competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time sales margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price aep can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce margins and therefore diminish revenues and results of operations volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated applies to all registrants 

the exposure of aep’s power trading activities is managed by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result management cannot predict the impact that aep’s energy trading and risk management decisions may have on aep’s business operating results or financial position 

aep routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by aep resulting from the management of aep’s trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position 

aep’s power trading risk management activities including power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be impacted if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

aep’s power trading activities also expose aep to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that aep’s power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls through longterm power purchase agreements aep would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

in connection with these trading activities aep routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose aep to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner aep does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations 

parties with whom aep has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm aep’s results of operations applies to all registrants 

aep is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe aep money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform aep may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed aep’s contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and aep might incur losses although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

aep relies on electric transmission facilities that aep does not own or control if these facilities do not provide aep with adequate transmission capacity aep may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of aep’s power applies to all registrants 

aep depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power aep sells at wholesale this dependence exposes aep to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate aep may not be able to sell and deliver aep wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate aep’s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 5 billion of construction expenditures for 2016  estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand borrowing under aeps revolving credit agreements and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2014  annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and our access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test in addition the acceleration of aep’s payment obligations or the obligations of certain of our major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under these credit agreements as of december 31 2014  aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2014  annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean water act requirements 

our operations are subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in our power plants in 2014 the federal epa issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule the standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a sitespecific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the us court of appeals for the second circuit and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court 

the federal epa is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s national pollutant discharge elimination system program these standards were last updated over 20 years ago and the federal epa proposed revised standards in 2013 a final rule is expected in september 2015 for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues 

coal ash regulation 

our operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials in december 2008 the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority’s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties prompting federal and state reviews of ash storage and disposal practices at many coalfired electric generating facilities including ours aep operates 37 ash ponds and we manage these ponds in a manner that complies with state and local requirements including dam safety rules designed to assure the structural integrity of these facilities we also operate a number of dry disposal facilities in accordance with state standards including ground water monitoring and other applicable standards in december 2014 the federal epa signed a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units the final rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule spanning approximately four years after publication of the final rule in the federal register if existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available extensions are available for completion of certain activities for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on our operations see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuescoal combustion residual rule 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting our power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2  emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2  emissions of 89 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010 the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x  emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2  capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs we continue to meet our obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2  and no x  emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many of our facilities we have installed additional controls and taken other actions to achieve compliance with these programs 

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25  standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new 

rule was signed by the administrator in december 2012 that lowers the annual standard a new ozone standard was proposed in 2014 the federal epa also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2  in 2010 a lower standard for no x  in 2010 and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2014 the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011 the states are in the process of developing new sips for the so 2  no x  and pm 25  standards which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on our facilities additional designations of so 2  nonattainment areas and finalization of a more stringent ozone standard could also lead to the imposition of more stringent emission limitations on our facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which requires additional reductions in so 2  and no x  emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs in august 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that contains more stringent requirements to control so 2  and no x  emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 27 states and the district of columbia petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and csapr was vacated that decision was subsequently reversed by the us supreme court and remanded back to the us court of appeals for further proceedings the federal epa filed a motion to lift the stay and allow phase i of csapr to take effect on january 1 2015 and phase ii to take effect on january 1 2017 the court granted the federal epas motion an interim final rule has been issued and further consideration of the petitions for review on csapr will continue during 2015 while phase i is in effect for additional information regarding cair and csapr see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

hazardous air pollutants 

as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants petitions for review of the mact standards were denied by the us court of appeals for the dc circuit but in 2014 the us supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether federal epa should have considered costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units for additional information regarding mact see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso is in the process of implementing a settlement with the federal epa in order to comply with the regional haze program requirements in oklahoma federal epa is likely to issue a federal implementation plan for arkansas in 2015 for additional information regarding cavr and the regional haze program requirements see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issuesclean air act requirements 

climate change 

we continue to support a federal legislative approach to energy policy as the most effective means of reducing emissions of co 2  and other greenhouse gases generally referred to as co 2  that recognizes that a reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to economic recovery and growth we do not believe regulating co 2  emissions under the caa is the appropriate solution in the past decade we have taken voluntary actions to reduce and offset our co 2  emissions and have complied with state energy policies designed to reduce carbon emissions through increasing reliance on renewable resources and expanding our energy efficiency programs 

aeps total co 2  emissions in 2014 not including our ownership in the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately 120 million metric tons this represents a reduction of 18 compared to our 2005 co 2 emission of approximately 146 million metric tons we expect minor variations in co 2  emissions in the nearterm as potential sales and emission increases from rebounding economic activity to be offset by expected changes in generation sources 

we expect our emissions to continue to decline over time as we diversify our generating sources and operate fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals our strategy for this transformation includes diversifying our fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support 

in the absence of comprehensive climate change legislation the federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2  emissions under the existing provisions of the caa such actions are being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co 2  emissions see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues –  climate change co 2  regulation and energy policy 

our fossil fuelfired generating units are large sources of co 2  emissions if substantial co 2  emission reductions are required there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units to the extent we install additional controls on our generation plants to limit co 2  emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase our rates return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings prudently incurred capital investments made by our subsidiaries in rateregulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment we would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements however requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can affect us adversely because our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates for our sales of energy into the markets however there is no such recovery mechanism 

renewable sources of energy 

some of the states we serve have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources arkansas indiana louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma texas virginia and west virginia during 2014 in support of our goals or requirements our operating companies procured rights to an additional 199 mw of wind power and at the end of 2014 our operating companies had longterm contracts for 2183 mw of wind and 10 mw of solar power in addition the indiana utility regulatory commission has approved ims proposal for a selfbuild clean energy solar pilot project 157 mw when the additional projects under construction andor pending regulatory approval are added and netted against one wind contract that is expiring at the end of 2015 the total renewable portfolio will be 2715 mw to serve our regulated operating company customers we actively manage our compliance position and are on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

end use energy efficiency 

beginning in 2008 aep ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available since that time aep operating companies have implemented over 100 programs across the aep service territory and in most of the states we serve for the period 2008 through 2014 these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 52 million megawatt hours and peak demand by over 1500 mw to achieve these levels aep operating companies invested approximately 700 million during the same period these results are preliminary and subject to independent third party evaluation and verification of savings as required 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states we serve and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for us to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments going forward we will work closely with regulators to ensure that plans are in place to meet specific regulatory and legislative energy efficiency andor demand reduction targets present in the respective jurisdictions 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of our strategic plan our board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by our actions the board of directors is informed of any new material issues including changes to environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that could affect the company the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about the company’s environmental financial and social performance 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2014  annual reports under the heading entitled the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation for further information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2012  2013  and 2014  and the current estimates for 2015  2016  and 2017  are shown below in each case including debt afudc estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generation plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2014 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2  becomes regulated at existing facilities the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system we typically recover costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions for our sales of energy into the markets however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled environmental issues and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2014  annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 



  

 

business segments 

our reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements entitled business segments included in the 2014 annual reports for additional information on our operating segments 

vertically integrated utilities 

 

transmission and distribution utilities 

 

aep transmission holdco 

 

generation  marketing 

 

aep river operations 

 

vertically integrated utilities 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by aegco apco im kgpco kpco pso swepco and wpco aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries 

electric generation 

facilities and coordination 

as of december 31 2014  aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 26900 mw of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2014  counterparties posted approximately 9 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   53 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2014  annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

fuel supply 

the 2012 and 2013 results include fuel used and transported by opco a utility subsidiary that is not part of the vertically integrated utilities segment opco’s results appear here because it retained its generation until yearend 2013 at which point all of its generation was transferred to agr which transferred portions to apco and kpco 

the table shows the sources of fuel used by the vertically integrated utilities 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2014 fossil fuel costs for the vertically integrated utilities were relatively unchanged on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2013 a slight decline in the cost of coal was offset by an increase in natural gas prices during the first half of 2014 

coal and lignite 

aep’s vertically integrated utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2014 was higher than 2013 due to strong demand in the east during the first half of the year but coal inventories ended the year at target levels on a system basis 

management believes that the vertically integrated utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 4990 railcars approximately 509 barges 12 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities see aep river operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit liquid coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of this segment 

spot market prices for coal decreased throughout 2014 the decreased spot coal prices during the year can be attributed to weak european coal demand and relatively inexpensive natural gas in the second half of 2014 approximately half of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts as those contracts expire they are replaced with contracts at current market prices the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods the price paid for coal delivered in 2014 decreased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in spot coal prices and heavier reliance on shorter term contracts 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the vertically integrated utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the vertically integrated utilities 



the coal supplies at the vertically integrated utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2014 the vertically integrated utilities coal inventory was approximately 31 days of full load burn 

natural gas 

the vertically integrated utilities consumed over 96 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2014 for generating power this represents a decrease of 15 from 2013 961 billion cubic feet in 2014 as compared to 1124 billion cubic feet in 2013 excluding opco usage while aep’s natural gasfired generating capacity has increased over the past several years with the addition of the stall and dresden units the implementation of the spp market and change in the dispatch of aep’s natural gas fleet resulted in a decreased natural gasfired generation despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply the us pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gasfired generation several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines however which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the vertically integrated utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the vertically integrated utilities results for 2013 and 2012 include natural gas delivered to opco while results for 2014 do not 



nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis im completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012 which consisted of 12 casks 32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each the second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks is expected to be completed in 2015 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2012 in it the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 13 billion to 17 billion in 2012 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2014  the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 18 billion the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies included in the 2014  annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility 

certain power agreements 

im 

the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until 2001 ovec supplied from its generation capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the united states department of energy the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each was extended by the owners in 2011 from the termination date of march 2026 until june 2040 aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests ovec financed capital expenditures totaling 13 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances both ovec generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service opco attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the intercompany power agreement to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by ohio law opco failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of ovec and therefore filed a request with the puco seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of ovec in december 2013 the puco approved opco’s request subject to the condition that energy from the ovec entitlements are sold into the dayahead or realtime pjm energy markets or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangemen t opco has filed an application with the puco to approve a purchased power agreement ppa rider that would allow retail customers to receive a rate stabilizing charge or credit by hedging marketbased prices with a costbased purchase power agreement the ppa would initially be based upon opcos contractual entitlement under the intercompany agreement which is approximately 20 of ovecs capacity  

electric delivery 

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – competition 

the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with pjm spp and ercot and as approved by the ferc 

transmission agreement 

apco im kgpco kpco and wpco own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the pjm oatt and are parties to the ta opco a subsidiary in our transmission and distribution utilities segment is also a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by pjm the ta has been approved by the ferc 

the following table shows the net charges allocated among the certain parties to the ta during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



tca oatt and ercot protocols 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to the tca under the tca a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of a overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement including the performance of transmission planning studies b the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and c compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff pursuant to the tca aepsc has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the oatt on behalf of the other parties to the agreement the tca also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the oatt these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated pursuant to the tca and spp oatt protocols as described above for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



transmission services for nonaffiliates 

in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – electric transmission and distribution – regional transmission organizations below transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission 

aep’s system transmission integration agreement was terminated effective june 1 2014 it provided for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east companies and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functioned as an umbrella agreement in addition to the ta and the tca aep’s system transmission integration agreement contained two service schedules that governed 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplated that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm and pso and swepco are members of the spp both fercapproved rtos rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not 

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2014  annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales the factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all 

transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc increased utility merger oversight 

competition 

the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by opco tcc and tnc opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1466000  retail customers in ohio tcc is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 817000  retail customers through reps in southern texas tnc is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 189000  retail customers through reps in west and central texas 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the puct for tcc and tnc and by the puco and the ferc for opco the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business 

the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules protocols and agreements in place with pjm and ercot and as approved by the ferc in addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies 

transmission agreement 

opco together with apco im kgpco kpco and wpco is a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the cost of their transmission facilities the ta has been approved by the ferc opco’s net charges allocated to it under the ta during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  were 17 million 89 million and 61 million respectively 

regional transmission organizations 

opco is a member of pjm a fercapproved rto rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not tcc and tnc are members of ercot 

regulation 

opco provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at costbased rates approved by the puco or by the ferc tcc and tnc provide transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules transmission and distribution rates are established on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service the cost of service generally reflects operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for transmission of electric power accounting and other matters the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc increased utility merger oversight 

seasonality 

the delivery of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s transmission and distribution facilities in addition aep transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep transmission and distribution’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep transmission and distribution’s results of operations 

generation  marketing 

general 

our generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business the largest subsidiary in our generation  marketing segment is agr on december 31 2013 agr acquired the generation assets and related liabilities at net book value of opco in a series of transactions approved by the puco and the ferc agr transferred a portion of the generation assets and liabilities at net book value that it received to apco and kpco and in 2015 to wpco as a result of these transactions agr owns 9159 mw of generating capacity with rights to an additional 1186 mw pursuant to a unit power agreement see below other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

with respect to our wholesale energy trading and marketing business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in ercot miso and pjm we sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities 

these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent overthecounter swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to our retail supply and energy management business our subsidiary aep energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had approximately 240000 customer accounts as of december 31 2014  

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of utilities including agr which is a public utility as defined by the ferc and set costbased rates if ferc subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions as a condition to the order granting agr marketbased rate authority every three years agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies we are also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation with the approval of ferc 

competition 

the generation and marketing subsidiaries of aep face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors impacting us are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation it is possible that changes in regulatory policies or advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines windmills and photovoltaic solar cells will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production our ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations is a significant determinate of our competitiveness 

with over 70 of our generation fleet fueled by coal our overall competitive position is impacted by the price of natural gas relative to coal while higher relative natural gas prices generally favor our competitive position lower relative natural gas prices will favor our competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting our competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near our generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at our generation facilities 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2014  counterparties posted approximately 26 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation and marketing subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation and marketing subsidiaries posted approximately   220 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2014  annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

fuel supply 

the table shows the sources of fossil fuel used on a heat basis by agr 



a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels 

coal and consumables 

agr procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms as contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements 

management believes that agr will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units agr through contracts ownership and leases has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in our generating facilities agr plants consumed 161 million tons of coal in 2014 

the coal supplies at agr plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2014 agr’s coal inventory was adequate to meet the generation demand of the coal fleet 

natural gas 

despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply the us pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gasfired generation a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate agr plants consumed 50 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2014 an increase of approximately 9 from 2013 

certain power agreements 

aegco 

the unit power agreement between aegco and agr assigned from opco dated march 15 2007 provides for the sale by aegco to agr of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to agr from the lawrenceburg plant a 1186 mw natural gasfired unit owned by aegco agr is obligated to pay a capacity charge whether or not power is available from the lawrenceburg plant and the fuel operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by agr and to reimburse aegco for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the lawrenceburg plant the agreement will continue in effect until december 31 2017 unless extended 

opco 

pursuant to a power supply agreement psa between agr and opco agr supplies capacity for opco’s switched and nonswitched retail load for the period january 1 2014 through may 31 2015 agr also supplied the energy needs of opco’s nonswitched retail load that was not acquired through auctions from january 1 2014 through december 31 2014 under the psa 

other 

as of december 31 2014  the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 mw of companyowned domestic wind power facilities 177 mw of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 355 mw of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers tnc’s interest in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot 

aep transmission holdco aepthco 

general 

aepthco is a holding company for a aep’s transmission joint ventures and b aeptco which is the direct holding company for the seven whollyowned fercregulated transmissiononly electric utilities transcos listed below each of which is geographically aligned with our existing utility operating companies 

aeptco transcos 

aep east transmission companies  all located within pjm 

 

aep west transmission companies  all located within spp 

 

transmission development through the transcos is primarily driven by 

 

the transcos develop own and operate transmission assets that are physically connected to aep’s existing system they are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the ferc and employ a forwardlooking formula rate tariff design the transcos are independent of but overlay aep’s existing vertically integrated utility operating companies and the transmission operations of opco aptco imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco have received approvals for formation or did not require state commission approval to operate imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco currently own and operate transmission assets or have assets under construction aptco requires approval from the virginia scc on a project by project basis the apsc has denied swtcos application to operate in arkansas an application for regulatory approval for swtco is under consideration in louisiana as of december 31 2014 aeptco had 18 billion of transmission assets inservice with plans to construct approximately 3 billion of additional transmission assets through 2017 

joint venture initiatives 

aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america 

we are currently participating in the following joint venture initiatives 



 

our joint ventures do not have employees business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and other aep subsidiaries and the joint venture partners during 2014 approximately 665 aepsc employees and 260 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures the amount of service provided was equal to the service of approximately 195 fulltime employees 

regulation 

the transcos and joint ventures located outside of ercot establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to fercapproved implementation protocols the protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated 

the transcos’ and joint ventures’ where applicable rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system the ferc requires transmission providers such as pjm and spp to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis 

the fercapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement atrr and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with ferc the formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous year’s billings allowing for over and underrecovery of the transmission owner’s atrr pjm and spp pay the transmission owners their atrr for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatt for the service taken 

the formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 1149 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity for the aep east transmission companies the aep west transmission companies are allowed a return on equity of 1120 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity the authorized returns on equity for the transcos are commensurate with the fercauthorized returns on equity in the pjm and spp oatts respectively for aep’s utility subsidiaries 

in the annual rate based filings described above the transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of 1448 million in 2014 776 million for 2013 and 283 million for 2012 the total transmission revenue requirement filed in the atrr including prior year overunder recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges for 2014 2013 and 2012 was 229 million 107 million and 35 million respectively 

the rates of ett which is located in ercot are determined by the puct ett sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim transmission costs of services tcos filings ett may file interim tcos filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital 

our joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 996 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 

competition 

one of the most significant provisions of ferc order no 1000 is the removal of the federal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities within tariffs and agreements for certain regional transmission projects historically vertically integrated public utilities had the right to build and own transmission lines proposed by the region’s planning processes when those lines connected to facilities within their respective retail service territories ferc order no 1000 eliminates the federal right of first refusal in regional transmission organization rto tariffs for incumbent utilities to construct certain regional transmission projects within their own service territories thereby creating the opportunity for any qualified entity to build and own regional transmission facilities in any service territory transource was created to respond to ferc order no 1000 competitive processes at the rto level 

aep river operations 

our aep river operations segment transports liquid coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generation plants aep river operations includes approximately 2300 barges 37 towboats and 18 harbor boats that we own or lease in 2015 river operations will operate its current fleet of 40 ten thousand barrel tank barges and may add an additional 40 ten thousand barrel tank barges throughout the year these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – electric generation – fuel supply – coal and lignite 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather water levels and inefficient older river locks may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed or commercial traffic is limited 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions –  affecting each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished 

our regulated electric revenues earnings and results are dependent on state regulation that may limit our ability to recover costs and other amounts –  affecting each registrant 

the rates our customers pay to our regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the ferc and the respective state utility commissions of ohio texas virginia west virginia oklahoma indiana louisiana kentucky arkansas michigan and tennessee if our regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease our future earnings additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal our future earnings could be negatively impacted any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost including fuel and related costs generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved 

our transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities –  affecting each registrant 

we expect that a growing portion of our earnings in the future will derive from the transmission investments and activities of aeptco and our transmission joint ventures ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if ferc were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected our strategy of investing in transmission could be curtailed we believe our experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives us an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp or other rtos will authorize any new transmission projects or will award any such projects to us if the ferc were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for our transmission investments and facilities or if one or more states were to successfully limit ferc jurisdiction on recovery of costs on transmission investment and its return it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled –  affecting each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects is canceled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition if we have recorded any construction work or investments as an asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk –  affecting aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or about 6 of the generating capacity in the aep system we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect our performance in these regions –  affecting each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards –  affecting each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions –  affecting each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation transmission and distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage our reputation   –  affecting each registrant 

we own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems software or networks as targets for cyber attack in addition our business requires that we collect and maintain sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

a successful cyber attack on the systems that control our generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing us from serving customers or collecting revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring we maintain cyber insurance to cover liabilities and losses directly arising from a potential cyber event we also maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain resultant physical damage or thirdparty injuries caused by potential cyber events however damage and claims arising from such incidents may exceed the amount of any insurance available and other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered at all for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

in an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions we have a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality integrity and availability of data and systems in addition we are subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements however cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt and as a result there is a risk that we could experience a successful cyber attack despite our current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts 

if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition –  affecting each registrant 

we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses –  affecting each registrant 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive in periods of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt or on the investment grade ratings of aep most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries –  affecting aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans 

from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions –  affecting each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce our future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations –  affecting each registrant 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our future net income and cash flows may be reduced 

changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance –  affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal we have existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures as long as current environmental programs remain in effect we have sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of our projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if we need to obtain allowances under a replacement rule those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which exposes us to market prices of natural gas historically natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources recently however the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility our ability to make sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our sales prices so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and on occasion we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants we expect the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a longterm material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result as those transactions are marked to market those transactions may reduce future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our aep river operations segment is subject to risks that are beyond our control –  affecting aep 

our aep river operations segment transports liquid coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers these activities can be hazardous and depend on natural conditions and forces our river transport operations could result in an environmental event such as a serious spill or release in addition if drought conditions or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to drop below the amount necessary to permit commercial barging traffic it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river conversely if unusually high amounts of precipitation or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to be too high to permit commercial barging traffic it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river extreme water levels that do not close river basin commercial traffic can still harm our business if the levels curtail the total volume permitted to move on the affected river the levels on portions of the mississippi river in 2013 were near the lowest since the levels caused by severe drought in 1988 water levels during 2014 were improved and generally considered favorable for barge operations any reduction in the commercial activities of our aep river operations due to extreme water levels could reduce future net income and cash flows 

we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change –  affecting each registrant 

climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of our service territory could also have an impact on our revenues we buy and sell electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on our own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as we buy shortterm energy to serve our own system which would increase the cost of energy we provide to our customers 

severe weather impacts our service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases this could increase our cost of providing service changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations principally our fossil generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy we may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact our revenues our financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies we serve the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of our communities 

we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to our business activities –  affecting each registrant 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of our business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

risks relating to state restructuring 

customers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers as allowed by ohio law and regulation –  affecting aep 

under current ohio law electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service cres providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service as customer switching in ohio continues it could reduce agr’s future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps –  affecting aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately one hundred reps in 2014 tcc’s largest rep accounted for 25 of its operating revenue and its second largest rep accounted for 23 of its operating revenue tnc’s largest rep accounted for 11 of its operating revenues and its second largest rep accounted for 9 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and impact financial condition 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant –  affecting each registrant 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and 

impact financial condition especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated if we retire generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants we typically recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition for our sales of energy from our competitive units there is no such costrecovery mechanism as a result we may not recover our costs through the market and we may be forced to shut competitive units down the costs of compliance for our competitive units could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

regulation of co 2  emissions could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain –  affecting each registrant 

the us congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control co 2 emissions since 2009 in december 2009 the federal epa issued a final endangerment finding under the caa regarding emissions from motor vehicles the federal epa finalized co 2 emission standards for new motor vehicles and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of co 2 emissions in a phased manner several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the federal epa’s subsequent rulemakings the supreme court agreed to review whether the federal epa reasonably determined that establishing standards for new motor vehicles automatically triggered regulation of stationary sources through the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs and determined that the federal epa was neither compelled nor authorized to automatically regulate stationary sources of co 2  emissions under these programs but that the federal epa could establish requirements for best available control technology reviews of co 2  emissions for sources otherwise required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration permit if their emissions exceed a reasonable level the federal epa must undertake additional rulemaking to establish such requirements and a reasonable level 

in 2012 the federal epa issued a proposed co 2 emissions standard for new power generation sources in response to the comments submitted on this proposed rule and in accordance with a directive from the president the federal epa withdrew the april 2012 proposed rule and has issued a new proposal this proposed rule includes separate but equivalent standards for natural gas and coalfired units based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage at coal units in june 2014 the federal epa issued standards for modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units the guidelines for existing sources include aggressive emission rate goals that are composed of a number of measures management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major us industrial enterprises including aep and our customers 

co 2  standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs and could impact the dates for retirement of our coalfired units we typically recover costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential co 2  and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions for our sales of energy into the markets however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs should they arise could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

we may be harmed if our merchant generation fleet is not profitable or loses value – affecting aep 

we are evaluating strategic alternatives for our merchant generation fleet which primarily includes agr’s generation fleet which operates in pjm and a 547 interest in the oklaunion plant which operates in ercot potential alternatives may include but are not limited to continued operation of the merchant generation fleet executing a ppa with a regulated affiliate for certain merchant generation units in ohio a spinoff of the merchant generation fleet or a sale of the merchant generation fleet we have not made a decision regarding the potential alternatives nor have we set a specific timeframe for a decision certain of these alternatives could result in a loss which could reduce future net income and cash flow and impact financial condition 

amounts we receive from the results of pjm capacity auctions associated with our nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate us –  affecting aep 

financial returns on agr’s generation capacity are subject to the results of annual pjm capacity auctions recent auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity we expect a significant decline in agr capacity revenues after may 2015 when the power supply agreement between agr and opco ends additionally we expect a decline in agr capacity revenues from june 2016 through may 2017 based upon the decrease in the pjm base auction price pjm recently proposed at ferc a set of supplemental auctions for 201617 and 201718 those auctions may mitigate the decline in capacity revenues however this proposal has not yet been accepted at ferc and we can give no assurance that the ferc will approve the proposal if the pjm capacity auctions continue to result in clearing prices lower than the cost of our capacity it could reduce our future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our emissions –  affecting each registrant 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we among others were defendants in general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce emissions such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers this could have a material impact on our costs in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of our generating facilities –  affecting each registrant 

we primarily generate electricity at large central facilities this method results in economies of scale and lower costs than a newer technologies such as fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells and b distributed generation using either new or existing technology other technologies such as light emitting diodes leds increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it it is possible that advances in technologies the availability of distributed generation or changes in regulatory policies will lower the demand for electricity or reduce the costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our profitability is impacted by our continued authorization to sell power at marketbased rates –  affecting each registrant 

ferc has granted agr apco im kpco opco pso and swepco authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates ferc reserves the right to revoke or revise this marketbased rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions each company that has obtained marketbased rate authority from ferc must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for marketbased rates the loss of marketbased rate authority by any of these entities especially by agr could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control –  affecting each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated –  affecting each registrant 

we attempt to manage the exposure of or power trading activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

we may not successfully manage the uncertainty involved with our power trading including coal natural gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing –  affecting each registrant 

our power trading activities also expose us to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that our power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls through longterm power purchase agreements we would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

for example the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves placing further downward pressure on natural gas prices and has reduced the need for our coalfired generation further in the event that alternative generation resources such as wind and solar are mandated or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity this occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and could also result in an impairment of certain longlived assets 

in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations –  affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power –  affecting each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets

title to property 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the aep system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio tennessee texas virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 45 billion of construction expenditures for 2015  including debt afudc and assets acquired under leases estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather legal reviews and the ability to access capital for additional information on our construction program see combined management’s narrative discussion and analysis under the heading entitled budgeted construction expenditures for each registrant

 item 9a controls and procedures 

during 2014  management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of american electric power company inc “aep” appalachian power company indiana michigan power company ohio power company public service company of oklahoma and southwestern electric power company each a “registrant” and collectively the “registrants” evaluated each respective registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of the registrant that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to each registrant’s management including the principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as of december 31 2014  these officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures in place are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures accomplished their objectives the registrants continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as events warrant 

there have been no changes in the registrants’ internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter 2014 that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrants’ internal control over financial reporting 

management assessed and reported on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  as a result of that assessment management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of december 31 2014  and therefore concluded that each registrant’s internal control over financial reporting was effective

aep was incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in 1906 and reorganized in 1925 it is a public utility holding company that owns directly or indirectly all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries 

the service areas of aep’s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia the transmission facilities of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are interconnected and their operations are coordinated transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served the public utility subsidiaries of aep have traditionally provided electric service consisting of generation transmission and distribution on an integrated basis to their retail customers restructuring laws in michigan ohio and the ercot area of texas have caused aep public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers in ohio aep’s regulated utility recently separated its generation assets from its distribution and transmission assets 

the member companies of the aep system have contractual financial and other business relationships with the other member companies such as participation in the aep system savings and retirement plans and tax returns sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel the companies of the aep system also obtain certain accounting administrative information systems engineering financial legal maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider aepsc

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand borrowing under aeps revolving credit agreements and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2013 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and our access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and for aep and its significant subsidiaries a 50 million crossacceleration provision as of december 31 2013 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2013 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting our power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2 emissions of 89 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010 the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2 capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs we continue to meet our obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2 and no x emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many of our facilities we have installed additional controls and taken other actions to achieve compliance with these programs 

  

  

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25 standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new rule was signed by the administrator in december 2012 that lowers the annual standard a new ozone standard is also under development the federal epa also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2 in 2010  a lower standard for no x in 2010 and a lower standard for lead in 2008 the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011 the states will develop new sips for these standards which could result in additional emission reductions being required from our facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which requires additional reductions in so 2 and no x emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs for additional information regarding cair see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements in august 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that would impose new and more stringent requirements to control so 2 and no x emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 27 states and the district of columbia petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and csapr was vacated that decision is currently under review by the us supreme court cair remains in effect until the federal epa develops a replacement rule for additional information regarding csapr see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

hazardous air pollutants 

as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants for additional information regarding mact see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso is in the process of implementing a settlement with the federal epa in order to comply with the regional haze program requirements in that state for additional information regarding cavr and the regional haze program requirements see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

  

  

co 2 regulation 

in the absence of comprehensive climate change legislation the federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2 emissions under the existing requirements of the caa such actions are being legally challenged by numerous parties for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co 2 emissions see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

our fossil fuelfired generating units are large sources of co 2 emissions if substantial co 2 emission reductions are required there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units to the extent we install additional controls on our generation plants to limit co 2 emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase our rates return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings prudently incurred capital investments made by our subsidiaries in rateregulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment we would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements however requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can affect us adversely because our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates for our sales of energy based on market rate authority however there is no such recovery mechanism 

several states have adopted programs that directly regulate co 2 emissions from power plants but none of these programs are currently in effect in states where we have generating facilities some of our states have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources arkansas indiana louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma texas virginia and west virginia we are taking steps to comply with these requirements primarily through entering into power supply agreements giving us access to power generated by wind turbines federal epa has been consulting with states to see whether and how such programs might become part of a co 2 emission reduction program for existing utility generating units for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

 

clean water act requirements 

 

our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in our power plants in april 2011 the federal epa issued a proposed rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that will reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the proposed standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule the proposed standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a sitespecific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment we submitted comments on this proposal and we expect the federal epa to issue revised rules in 2014 

the federal epa is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s national pollutant discharge elimination system program these standards were last updated over 20 years ago and the federal epa has issued two rounds of information collection requests to inform its rulemaking in october 2009 the federal epa issued a final report for the power plant sector and determined that revisions to its existing standards are necessary the federal epa proposed revised standards in 2013 for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues 

coal ash regulation 

our operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials the federal epa completed an extensive study of the characteristics of coal ash in 2000 and concluded that combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous waste in december 2008 the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority’s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash 

  

  

  

into a nearby river and onto private properties prompting federal and state reviews of ash storage and disposal practices at many coalfired electric generating facilities including ours aep operates 37 ash ponds and we manage these ponds in a manner that complies with state and local requirements including dam safety rules designed to assure the structural integrity of these facilities we also operate a number of dry disposal facilities in accordance with state standards including ground water monitoring and other applicable standards in june 2010 the federal epa published a proposed rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on our operations see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – coal combustion residual rule 

climate change – position and strategy 

we continue to support a federal legislative approach to energy policy as the most effective means of reducing emissions of co 2 and other greenhouse gases generally referred to as co 2  that recognizes that a reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to economic recovery and growth we do not believe regulating co 2 emissions under the clean air act is the appropriate solution during the past decade we have taken voluntary actions to reduce and offset our co 2 emissions unfortunately two of the voluntary programs that helped businesses such as aep to set quantitative commitments no longer exist the federal epa’s climate leaders program and the chicago climate exchange both ended their reduction obligations at the end of 2010 however through these programs and others we voluntarily reduced our co 2 emissions by approximately 96 million metric tons during the 2003 to 2010 period 

we expect our emissions to continue to decline over time as we diversify our generating sources and operate fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals our strategy for this transformation is to protect the reliability of the electric system and reduce our emissions by pursuing multiple options these include diversifying our fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support meanwhile the federal epa began regulating co 2 emissions from large stationary sources such as power plants in 2012 under the new source review prevention of significant deterioration and title v operating permit programs 

in september 2013 the federal epa reproposed a carbon pollution standard for new power plants this regulation based on epa authority under section 111b of the clean air act would establish new source performance standards for co 2 for new fossilfueledfired electric generating units the proposed regulation would limit the ability to construct new coalfired facilities in the future due to strict emission limits if they are finalized aep does not currently have plans to permit or construct any new coalfired facilities and the proposed rule does not directly impact existing facilities the epa is scheduled to propose standards regulations or guidelines as appropriate for co 2 from existing fossil fuel units in june 2014 though the scope and extent of the standards is currently unknown 

for additional information on legislative and regulatory responses to greenhouse gases including limitations on co 2 emissions see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – climate change specific steps taken to reduce co 2 emissions include the following 

renewable sources of energy 

some of the states we serve have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources arkansas indiana louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma texas virginia and west virginia at the end of 2013 and in support of our goals or requirements our operating companies had longterm contracts for 1984 mw of wind and 10 mw of solar power when additional contracts for projects under construction andor pending regulatory approval are added and netted against one wind contract that is expiring at the end of 2015 the total renewable portfolio will be 2698 mw to serve our regulated operating company customers we actively manage our compliance position and are on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

  

  

end use energy efficiency 

in 2008 aep ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs these programs commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available since that time aep operating companies have implemented over 100 programs across the aep service territory and in most of the states we serve for the period 2008 through 2013 these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 4000000 megawatt hours and peak demand by over 1200 mw to achieve these levels aep operating companies invested approximately 540 million during the same period these results are preliminary and subject to independent third party evaluation and verification of savings as required 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states we serve and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for us to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments going forward we will work closely with regulators to ensure that plans are in place to meet specific regulatory and legislative energy efficiency andor demand reduction targets present in the respective jurisdictions 

current and projected co 2 emissions 

our total co 2 emissions in 2012 not including our ownership in the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately 122 million metric tons our 2013 emissions decreased to approximately 114 million metric tons we expect overall increases in co 2 emissions during the next few years to be small if any as our sales and generation rebound somewhat from recession lows in 2009 however over much of the remainder of the decade we expect emissions to decline as modest sales growth is offset by retirements of older less efficient coalfired units and increased utilization of natural gas 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of our strategic plan our board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by our actions the board of directors is informed of any new material issues including changes to environmental regulations and proposed legislation that could affect the company the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information about the company’s environmental financial and social performance 

other environmental issues and matters 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2013 annual reports under the heading entitled the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation for further information 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2011 2012 and 2013 and the current estimates for 2014 2015 and 2016 are shown below in each case excluding equity afudc estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generation plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2013 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2 becomes regulated at existing facilities the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system we typically recover costs of complying with environmental standards from 

  

  

  

customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions for our sales of energy based on market rate authority however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled environmental issues and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2013 annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 

 

 

 

 

 

electric and magnetic fields emf 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances a number of studies in the past have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 

  

  

business segments 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we realigned our business segments as a result of corporate separation and plant transfers see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements entitled business segments included in the 2013 annual reports for additional information on our operating segments our reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below

aepsc pso and swepco are parties to the operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the operating agreement requires pso and swepco to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires that capacity in excess of the required margins be made available for sale to other operating companies as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales are generally shared based on the amount of energy pso or swepco contributes that is sold to third parties 

in january 2014 the ferc approved the modification of the operating agreement to address changes resulting from the anticipated march 2014 implementation of a “dayahead” power market by the spp 

  

  

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale 

power that is not needed to serve the native load of our vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of that subsidiary see risk management and trading below for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2013 counterparties posted approximately 11 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   59 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2013 annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

fuel supply 

the following table and fuel supply presentation under “fuel supply” “coal and lignite” and “natural gas” include the results of the fuel used and transported by opco a utility subsidiary that is not part of the vertically integrated utility segment opco’s results appear here because it retained its generation until yearend 2013 at which point all of its generation was transferred to agr which transferred portions to apco and kpco 

the table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system 

 

a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2013 fossil fuel costs increased approximately 9 on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2012 due primarily to an increase in natural gas prices 

coal and lignite 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2013 was down slightly from the same period in 2012 but coal inventories ended the year at target levels on a system basis 

management believes that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 5700 railcars approximately 600 barges 15 towboats and a coal handling 

  

  

  

terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities see aep river operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit liquid coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of this business segment 

spot market prices for coal remained relatively flat throughout 2013 and decreased for certain coals used by aep the relatively flat spot coal price performance during the year can be attributed to weak european coal demand a persistently sluggish domestic economy and relatively inexpensive natural gas approximately half of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts as those contracts expire they are replaced with contracts at current market prices the price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods the price paid for coal delivered in 2013 increased from the prior year primarily due to an increase in rail rates for western coal 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by aep system companies 

 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries at december 31 2013 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 34 days of full load burn 

natural gas 

through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed over 158 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2013 for generating power this represents a decrease of 28 from 2012 and reverses a trend that began in 2010 while aep’s natural gasfired generating capacity has increased over the past several years with the addition of the stall and dresden units the increase in natural gas prices in 2013 led to a decrease in demand for natural gasfired generation despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply the us pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gasfired generation several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines however which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by aep system companies 

 

nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis im began and completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012 which consisted of 12 casks 32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each the second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks is expected to occur in 2015 

  

  

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2012 in it the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 13 billion to 17 billion in 2012 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2013 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 16 billion the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies included in the 2013 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility 

certain power agreements 

im 

the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between aegco and kpco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

  

  

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until 2001 ovec supplied from its generation capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the united states department of energy the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each was extended by the owners in 2011 from the termination date of march 2026 until june 2040 aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests ovec’s board of directors authorized capital expenditures totaling 14 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants ovec has completed the financing of the 14 billion required for these projects through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances both ovec generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service opco attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the intercompany power agreement to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by ohio law opco failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of ovec and therefore filed a request with the puco seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of ovec in december 2013 the puco approved opco’s request subject to the condition that energy from the ovec entitlements are sold into the dayahead or realtime pjm energy markets or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangement 

electric delivery 

general 

other than aegco aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies

transmission services for nonaffiliates 

in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – electric transmission and distribution – regional transmission organizations below transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission 

aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east companies and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the ta and the tca aep’s system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern

regulation 

general 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

the rates of aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2013 annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales the factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 

  

  

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its balancing area of the spp aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketrate authority from the ferc under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals aegco apco im kgpco kpco and wpco are members of pjm pso and swepco are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc increased utility merger oversight 

competition 

the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

  

  

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission and distribution utilities 

general 

this business segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by opco tcc and tnc opco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1464000 retail customers in ohio tcc is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 806000 retail customers through reps in southern texas tnc is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 188000 retail customers through reps in west and central texas 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the puct for tcc and tnc and by the puco and the ferc for opco the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business 

the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules protocols and agreements in place with pjm and ercot and as approved by the ferc in addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas aep’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies 

transmission agreement 

opco together with apco im kgpco kpco and wpco is a party to the ta the ta defines how the parties to the agreement share the cost of their transmission facilities the ta has been approved by the ferc opco’s net charges allocated to it under the ta during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 89 million 61 million and 172 million respectively 

  

  

regional transmission organizations 

opco is a member of pjm a fercapproved rto rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not tcc and tnc are members of ercot 

regulation 

opco provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at costbased rates approved by the puco or by the ferc tcc and tnc provide transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules transmission and distribution rates are established on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service the cost of service generally reflects operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment 

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for transmission of electric power accounting and other matters the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc increased utility merger oversight 

seasonality 

the delivery of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s transmission and distribution facilities in addition aep transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep transmission and distribution’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep transmission and distribution’s results of operations 

generation  marketing 

our generation  marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business the largest subsidiary in our generation  marketing segment is agr on december 31 2013 agr acquired the generation assets and related liabilities at net book value of opco in a series of transactions approved by the puco and the ferc agr transferred a portion of the generation assets and liabilities   at net book value that it received to apco and kpco as a result of these transactions agr owns 10002 mw of generating capacity with rights to an additional 1186 mw pursuant to a unit power agreement see below other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the generation  marketing segment agr is a competitive generation subsidiary 

with respect to our wholesale energy trading and marketing business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in ercot miso and pjm we sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities 

  

  

  

these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent overthecounter swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges 

with respect to our retail supply and energy management business our subsidiary aep energy is a retail electricity supplier that supplies electricity to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had approximately 215000 customer accounts as of december 31 2013 

regulation 

agr is a public utility under the federal power act and is subject to ferc’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce under the federal power act ferc has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable ferc granted agr marketbased rate authority in december 2013 ferc’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the marketbased rates of utilities including agr which is a public utility as defined by the ferc and set costbased rates if ferc subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions as a condition to the order granting agr marketbased rate authority every three years agr is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates other matters subject to ferc jurisdiction include but are not limited to thirdparty financings review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility 

specific operations of agr are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies we are also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot additionally agr is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the nerc with the approval of ferc we are also regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot 

competition 

the generation and marketing subsidiaries of aep face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services the principal factors impacting us are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation it is possible that changes in regulatory policies or advances in newer technologies such as fuel cells microturbines windmills and photovoltaic solar cells will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production our ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations is a significant determinate of our competitiveness 

with over 70 of our generation fleet fueled by coal our overall competitive position is impacted by the price of natural gas relative to coal while higher relative natural gas prices generally favor our competitive position lower relative natural gas prices will favor our competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation other factors impacting our competitiveness include transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near our generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at our generation facilities 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter months the pattern of this fluctuation may change 

  

  

counterparty risk management 

counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2013 counterparties posted approximately 14 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aep for the benefit of aep’s generation and marketing subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s generation and marketing subsidiaries posted approximately   165 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2013 annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

fuel supply 

aep’s generation and marketing subsidiaries procure coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms management believes that aep’s generation and marketing subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coalfired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 5700 railcars approximately 600 barges and 15 towboats to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities 

most of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts as those contracts expire they can be replaced at the new market price with an impact in subsequent periods several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking commodity and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate

aep transmission holdco aepthco 

aepthco overview 

aepthco is a holding company for aeptco and for aep’s transmission joint ventures aeptco is a holding company for seven whollyowned fercregulated transmissiononly electric utilities transcos each of which is geographically aligned with our existing utility operating companies transmission development through the transcos is primarily driven by 

 

 

 

aeptco’s seven transcos are 

aep east transmission companies all located within pjm 

 

 

 

 

 

aep west transmission companies all located within spp 

 

 

the transcos develop own and operate transmission assets that are physically connected to aep’s existing system they are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the ferc and employ a forwardlooking formula rate tariff design the transcos are independent of but overlay aep’s existing verticallyintegrated utility operating companies and the transmission operations of opco imtco ktco ohtco oktco and wvtco have received approvals for formation or did not require state commission approval to operate imtco ohtco oktco and wvtco currently own and operate transmission assets or have assets under construction applications for regulatory approvals have been filed for swtco and are currently under consideration in arkansas and louisiana as of december 31 2013 aeptco had 991 million of transmission assets inservice with plans to construct nearly 2 billion of additional transmission assets through 2016 

joint venture initiatives 

aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america transource energy llc transource is a joint venture between aepthc 865 and great plains energy 135 transource was formed to pursue competitive projects resulting from ferc order no 1000 described further below under the heading competition our other joint ventures are at various stages of regulatory and rto approval 

  

  

 

 

in august 2012 the pjm board cancelled the potomacappalachian transmission highline project path project our transmission joint venture with firstenergy and removed it from the 2012 regional transmission expansion plan in september 2012 the path project companies submitted an application to the ferc requesting authority 

  

  

  

to recover prudentlyincurred costs associated with the project in november 2012 the ferc issued an order accepting the path projects abandonment cost recovery application subject to settlement procedures and hearing the settlement proceedings are ongoing aep’s investment in the path project as of december 31 2013 was 25 million 

our joint ventures do not have employees business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and other aep subsidiaries and the joint venture partners 

regulation 

the transcos and joint ventures located outside of ercot establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to fercapproved implementation protocols the protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated 

the transcos’ and joint ventures’ where applicable rates are included in the respective open access transmission tariff oatt for pjm and spp an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system the ferc requires transmission providers such as pjm and spp to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis 

the fercapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement atrr and transmission service rates for transmission owners the formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous year’s billings allowing for over and underrecovery of the transmission owner’s atrr pjm and spp pay the transmission owners their atrr for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatt for the service taken 

the rates of ett which is located in ercot are determined by the puct ett sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim transmission costs of services tcos filings ett may file interim tcos filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital 

our joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 996 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 

the transcos collectively filed rate base totals of 776 million in 2013 283 million for 2012 and 104 million for 2011 the total transmission revenue requirement filed in the atrr for 2013 2012 and 2011 was 99 million 35 million and 13 million respectively 

the formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 1149 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity for the aep east transmission companies the aep west transmission companies are allowed a return on equity of 1120 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity the authorized returns on equity for the transcos are commensurate with the fercauthorized returns on equity in the pjm and spp oatts respectively for aep’s utility subsidiaries 

competition 

one of the most significant provisions of ferc order no 1000 is the removal of the federal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities within tariffs and agreements for certain regional transmission projects historically vertically integrated public utilities had the right to build and own transmission lines proposed by the region’s planning processes when those lines connected to facilities within their respective retail service territories ferc order no 1000 eliminates the federal right of first refusal in regional transmission organization rto tariffs for incumbent utilities to construct certain regional transmission projects within their own service territories thereby creating the opportunity for any qualified entity to build and own regional transmission facilities in any service territory transource was created to respond to ferc order no 1000 competitive processes at the rto level as described above 

  

  

aep river operations 

our aep river operations segment transports liquid coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generation plants aep river operations includes approximately 2300 barges 36 towboats and 20 harbor boats that we own or lease in 2014 river operations will add at least 20 ten thousand barrel tank barges those barges will provide an entry into the tank barge business which will serve both current and new customers that transport liquid commodities these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment see item 1 – vertically integrated utilities – electric generation – fuel supply – coal and lignite 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather water levels and inefficient older river locks operated by others may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed or commercial traffic is limited 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions – affecting each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished 

approval of the june 2012 through may 2015 esp order in ohio may be overturned and is subject to appeal – affecting aep and opco 

in august 2012 the puco issued an order which adopted and modified an esp through may 2015 the “2012 esp” the 2012 esp allowed the continuation of the fuel adjustment clause maintained recovery of several previous esp riders and approved a storm damage recovery mechanism the 2012 esp further established a a nonbypassable distribution investment rider effective september 2012 through may 2015 to recover certain distribution investment and b a nonbypassable retail stability rider rsr a portion of which provides for the collection of deferred capacity costs the deferred capacity costs may exceed the amount we will collect under the rsr in january 2013 the puco issued an order on rehearing for the 2012 esp which generally upheld its prior order intervenors are challenging various parts of these orders at the puco and with the supreme court of ohio in parallel proceedings the puco addressed certain issues around the energy auctions while other issues were deferred to a separate docket the puco has agreed to issue a request for an independent auditor in the fuel adjustment clause proceeding to separately examine the recovery of the fixed fuel costs if all or part of 2012 esp is overturned by the puco or the supreme court of ohio or if deferred capacity and other costs are not recoverable it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our request for an esp from june 2015 through may 2018 may not be approved in its entirety – affecting aep and opco 

in december 2013 opco filed an application with the puco to approve an esp that includes proposed rate adjustments and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders effective june 2015 through may 2018 the proposal includes a return on common equity of 1065 for certain riders additionally the application identifies opco’s intention to submit a separate application to continue the rsr in which the unrecovered portion of the deferred capacity costs will continue to be collected until the balance of the capacity deferrals has been collected if the puco denies all or part of the requested esp it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

ohio may require us to refund revenue that we have collected – affecting aep and opco 

ohio law requires that the puco determine on an annual basis if rate adjustments included in prior orders resulted in significantly excessive earnings if the puco determines there were significantly excessive earnings the excess amount could be returned to customers in november 2013 opco filed its 2011 and 2012 significantly excessive earnings filings with the puco if the puco determines that opco’s earnings were significantly excessive and requires opco to return a portion of its revenues to customers it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not recover deferred fuel costs – affecting aep and opco 

in august 2012 the puco ordered recovery of deferred fuel costs beginning september 2012 through the phasein recovery rider the august 2012 order was upheld by the puco in october 2012 opco and intervenors have filed appeals at the supreme court of ohio if the supreme court of ohio does not permit full recovery of opco’s deferred fuel costs it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

  

  

ohio may require us to refund additional fuel costs – affecting aep and opco 

in january 2012 the puco ordered that proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement be applied against opco’s underrecovered fuel balance and that an outside consultant be hired to review our fuel procurement through 2011 the audit by the outside consultant included recommendations that would limit some of our fuel recovery or require us to refund certain fuel costs already incurred in addition an intervenor filed an appeal with the supreme court of ohio challenging the recovery of certain fuel costs any reduction to our fuel recovery by the puco andor the supreme court of ohio could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to the turk plant – affecting aep and swepco 

in december 2012 swepco placed the turk plant in arkansas into commercial operation swepco holds a 73 ownership interest in the 600 mw coalfired generating facility swepco had originally intended that the arkansas jurisdictional share of the turk plant approximately 20 would become part of the rate base for its retail customers in arkansas following a proceeding at the arkansas supreme court the apsc issued an order which reversed and set aside a previously granted certificate of environmental compatibility and public need the arkansas portion of the turk plant output is currently not subject to costbased rate recovery and is being sold into the wholesale market in addition in february 2013 the lpsc granted recovery for the louisiana portion of the turk plant costs in a formula rate filing subject to refund based on the staff review of the cost of service and prudence review of the turk plant if swepco cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the turk plant either through retail rates or sales into the wholesale market it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

request for rate recovery in indiana may be overturned on appeal – affecting aep and im 

in february 2013 the iurc issued an order granting an annual increase in base rates in march 2013 the indiana office of utility consumer counselor oucc filed an appeal of the order with the indiana court of appeals in september 2013 the oucc filed a brief on appeal that included objections to certain aspects of the rate case if any part of the order is overturned by the indiana court of appeals it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

approved recovery related to enabling the useful life of the cook plant may be overturned on appeal or further consideration – affecting aep and im 

in april and may 2012 im filed petitions with the iurc and the mpsc respectively for approval of the cook plant life cycle management project lcm project which consists of a group of capital projects for cook plant units 1 and 2 intended to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the plant through its extended licensed life 2034 for unit 1 and 2037 for unit 2 the estimated cost of the lcm project is 12 billion to be incurred through 2018 excluding afudc in january 2013 the mpsc approved a certificate of need con for the lcm project in february 2013 intervenors filed appeals with the michigan court of appeals objecting to the issuance of the con as well as the amount of the con related to the lcm project in july 2013 the iurc approved im’s proposed project apart from a minor exception which the iurc stated im could seek recovery in a base rate case im was granted recovery through an lcm project rider to be determined in a series of proceedings beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013 and then semiannually thereafter if im is not ultimately permitted to recover its lcm project costs it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

request for rate recovery in texas may not be approved in its entirety and could be overturned – affecting aep and swepco 

in july 2012 swepco filed a request with the puct for an increase in texas base rates in october 2013 the puct issued an order that granted part of the requested rate recovery additionally the puct determined that it would defer consideration of the requested increase in depreciation expense related to the change in the 2016 retirement date of the welsh plant unit 2 if swepco cannot ultimately recover its texas jurisdictional share of the investment and expenses related to the turk plant transmission lines or welsh plant unit 2 it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

  

  

request for rate recovery in oklahoma may not be approved in its entirety – affecting aep and pso 

in january 2014 pso filed a request with the occ to increase annual base rates by 38 million based upon a 105 return on common equity if pso cannot ultimately recover its costs that are the subject of this request it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities – affecting aep 

we expect that a growing portion of our earnings in the future will derive from the transmission investments and activities of aeptco and our transmission joint ventures ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if ferc were to adopt a different policy or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected our strategy of investing in transmission could be curtailed we believe our experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives us an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities however there can be no assurance that pjm spp or other rtos will authorize any new transmission projects or will award any such projects to us if the ferc were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for our transmission investments and facilities it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled – affecting each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects is canceled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition if we have recorded any construction work or investments as an asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements additions storm damage operations and maintenance expense repairs and other costs – affecting each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus commissionapproved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered we often finance the operations and maintenance expense to repair facilities damaged by storms or other severe weather events until the operations and maintenance storm costs including any deferred regulatory assets are recovered in rates we have also traditionally financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery similarly long lead times in construction and scheduled repairs the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments repairs and improvements while we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow including preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates there can be no assurance that these will be adopted that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner 

  

  

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control – affecting each registrant 

our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities however could negatively impact our revenues operating and capital expenditures and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials we could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk – affecting aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or about 6 of the generating capacity in the aep system we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

  

  

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect our performance in these regions – affecting each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards – affecting each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions – affecting each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation transmission and distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage our reputation – affecting each registrant 

we own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems software or networks as targets for cyber attack in addition our business requires that we collect and maintain sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

  

  

a successful cyber attack on the systems that control our generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing us from serving customers or collecting revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring we maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or thirdparty injuries caused by potential cyber security incidents however other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

in an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions we have a comprehensive cyber security program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality integrity and availability of data and systems in addition we are subject to mandatory cyber security regulatory requirements however cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt and as a result there is a risk that we could experience a successful cyber attack despite our current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts 

if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition – affecting each registrant 

we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses – affecting each registrant 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive in periods of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt or on the investment grade ratings of aep most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries – affecting aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness 

  

  

 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions – affecting each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance – affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal we have existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures as long as current environmental programs remain in effect we have sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of our projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if we need to obtain allowances under a 

  

  

  

replacement rule those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which exposes us to market prices of natural gas historically natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources recently however the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility our ability to make offsystem sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our offsystem sales prices so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and on occasion we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants we expect the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a longterm material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

our aep river operations business segment is subject to risks that are beyond our control – affecting aep 

our aep river operations business segment transports liquid coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers these activities can be hazardous and depend on natural conditions and forces our river transport operations could result in an environmental event such as a serious spill or release in addition if drought conditions or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to drop below the amount necessary to permit commercial barging traffic it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river conversely if unusually high amounts of precipitation or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to be too high to permit commercial barging traffic it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river extreme water levels that do not close river basin commercial traffic can still harm our business if the levels curtail the total volume permitted to move on the affected river the levels on portions of the mississippi river in 2013 have been reported as remaining at or approaching the lowest since the levels caused by severe drought in 1988 any reduction in the commercial activities of our aep river operations due to low water levels could reduce future net income and cash flows 

we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change – affecting each registrant 

there is a growing consensus on the evidence of global climate change climate change creates physical and financial risk physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity for residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers’ energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes 

  

increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions weather conditions outside of our service territory could also have an impact on our revenues we buy and sell electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on our own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as we buy shortterm energy to serve our own system which would increase the cost of energy we provide to our customers 

  

  

severe weather impacts our service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes and snow or ice storms occur to the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases this could increase our cost of providing service changes in precipitation resulting in droughts or water shortages could adversely affect our operations principally our fossil generating units a negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions could adversely impact our ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy we may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks 

to the extent climate change impacts a region’s economic health it may also impact our revenues our financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies we serve the price of energy as a factor in a region’s cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of our communities 

we cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to our business activities – affecting each registrant 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of our business operations the most significant of which are summarized in note 6 of the combined notes to consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks relating to state restructuring 

customers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers as allowed by ohio law and regulation – affecting aep 

under current ohio law electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service cres providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service through a short term agreement agr provides capacity and a decreasing portion of power to the ohio customers that have not switched as customer switching in ohio continues it could reduce agr’s future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps – affecting aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately one hundred reps in 2013 tcc’s largest rep accounted for 29 of its operating revenue and its second largest rep accounted for 16 of its operating revenue tnc’s largest rep accounted for 12 of its operating revenues and its second largest rep accounted for 7 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and impact financial condition 

  

  

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant – affecting each registrant 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and impact financial condition especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed and additional substances become regulated if we retire generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants we typically recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions failure to recover these costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition for our sales of energy from our competitive units there is no such costrecovery mechanism as a result we may not recover our costs through the market and we may be forced to shut competitive units down the costs of compliance for our competitive units could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions either through legislation or by the federal epa could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain – affecting each registrant 

the us congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control co 2 emissions since 2009 in december 2009 the federal epa issued a final endangerment finding under the caa regarding emissions from motor vehicles the federal epa also finalized co 2 emission standards for new motor vehicles and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of co 2 emissions in a phased manner several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the federal epa’s subsequent rulemakings the supreme court has agreed to review whether epa reasonably determined that establishing standards for new motor vehicles automatically triggered regulation of stationary sources through the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs 

in 2012 the federal epa issued a proposed co 2 emissions standard for new power generation sources with a co 2 limit equivalent to a natural gas unit in response to the comments submitted on this proposed rule and in accordance with a directive from the president epa withdrew the april 2012 proposed rule and has issued a new proposal this proposed rule includes separate but equivalent standards for natural gas and coalfired units based on the use of partial carbon capture and storage at coal units we do not believe that carbon capture and storage has been adequately demonstrated and intend to submit comments on the proposed rule the president has also directed federal epa to issue standards for modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development of state implementation plans that would reduce carbon emissions from existing utility units by june 2014 to finalize those standards by june 2015 and to require states to submit implementation plans no later than june 2016 management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major us industrial enterprises including aep and our customers 

if co 2 and other emission standards are imposed the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units we typically recover costs of complying with new requirements such as the potential co 2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions for our sales of energy based on market rate authority however there is no such recovery mechanism failure to recover these costs should they arise could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

  

  

amounts we receive from the results of pjm capacity auctions associated with our nonregulated generation assets could fail to adequately compensate us – affecting aep 

at the end of last year agr acquired most of the generation formerly owned by opco recovery of agr’s generation capacity is subject to the results of annual pjm capacity auctions recent auction results indicate a great deal of volatility and the possibility of clearing prices substantially lower than the cost of such capacity we formed a coalition with other utility companies to address mutual concerns related to the auction process and pjm has made filings with the ferc seeking modification of that process additional filings are expected we can give no assurance that the ferc will approve any modifications to the annual pjm capacity auctions if the annual pjm capacity auctions continue to result in clearing prices lower than the cost of our capacity it could reduce our future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our co 2 emissions – affecting each registrant 

in the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we among others were defendants in general the actions allege that co 2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance due to impacts of global warming and climate change the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if the pending or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce co 2 emissions such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers this could have a material impact on our costs in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

changes in technology and regulatory policies may cause our generating facilities to be less competitive – affecting each registrant 

we primarily generate electricity at large central facilities this method results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells microturbines windmills and photovoltaic solar cells it is possible that advances in technologies or changes in regulatory policies will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our profitability is impacted by our continued authorization to sell power at marketbased rates – affecting each registrant 

ferc has granted aegco agr apco im kpco opco pso and swepco authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates except in our balancing authority area of the spp where our wholesale power transactions are costcapped by ferc ferc reserves the right to revoke or revise this marketbased rate authority if it subsequently determines that one or more of these companies can exercise market power in transmission or generation create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions each company that has obtained marketbased rate authority from ferc must file a market power update every three years to show that they continue to meet ferc’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether entities qualify for marketbased rates the loss of marketbased rate authority by any of these entities especially by agr could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control – affecting each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of 

  

  

  

return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated – affecting each registrant 

we attempt to manage the exposure of or power trading activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

we may not successfully manage the uncertainty involved with our power trading including coal natural gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing – affecting each registrant 

our power trading activities also expose us to risks of commodity price movements to the extent that our power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls through longterm power purchase agreements we would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices 

for example the use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits has increased natural gas supply and reserves placing further downward pressure on natural gas prices and has reduced the need for our coalfired generation further in the event that alternative generation resources such as wind and solar are mandated or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant which could reduce the price at which 

  

  

  

market participants sell their electricity this occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and could also result in an impairment of certain longlived assets 

in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power – affecting each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations – affecting each registrant 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law doddfrank act the federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets and significantly alter how overthecounter otc derivatives are regulated the law increased regulatory oversight of otc energy derivatives including a imposing pervasive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc on dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps b requiring certain standardized otc derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges as directed by cftc c imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements on swap dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps and d increasing the monitoring and compliance obligations of parties who engage in swaps including new recordkeeping and reporting requirements with governmental entities the cftc has issued regulations exempting certain end users of energy commodities from being required to clear otc derivatives provided that they a are using the swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and b satisfy certain other requirements to the extent we meet such requirements the end user exemption could reduce the effect of the laws clearing requirements on our hedging activity pursuant to authority granted under the doddfrank act the cftc has also issued rules that among other things further define the otc derivative products and entities subject to additional regulatory oversight which recently became effective these requirements could subject us to additional regulatory oversight related to our otc derivative transactions cause our otc derivative transactions to be more costly and have an impact on financial condition due to additional capital requirements in addition as these reforms aim to standardize otc products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor otc derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the aep system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

  

  

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio tennessee texas virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 38 billion of construction expenditures for 2014 excluding equity afudc and assets acquired under leases estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather legal reviews and the ability to access capital for additional information on our construction program see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled budgeted construction expenditures for each registrant

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

during 2013 management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of american electric power company inc “aep” appalachian power company indiana michigan power company ohio power company public service company of oklahoma and southwestern electric power company each a “registrant” and collectively the “registrants” evaluated each respective registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of the registrant that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to each registrant’s management including the principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as of december 31 2013 these officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures in place are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures accomplished their objectives the registrants continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as events warrant 

the only change in the registrants’ internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter 2013 that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrants’ internal control over financial reporting relates to ohio power company’s corporate separation on december 31 2013 ohio power company transferred its generation assets and related liabilities to aep generation resources inc a subsidiary of aep certain of those generation assets and related liabilities were subsequently transferred to appalachian power company and kentucky power company in addition to the transfer of the generation assets and related liabilities the interconnection agreement among aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries was terminated and replaced with a new power coordination agreement among appalachian power company kentucky power company and indiana michigan power company in connection with these activities american electric power company inc appalachian power company indiana michigan power company and ohio power company implemented or modified a number of business processes and controls 

management assessed and reported on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 as a result of that assessment management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of december 31 2013 and therefore concluded that each registrant’s internal control over financial reporting was effective 

additional information required by this item of the registrants is incorporated by reference to management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in the 2013 annual report of each registrant

general 

overview and description of subsidiaries 

aep was incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in 1906 and reorganized in 1925 it is a public utility holding company that owns directly or indirectly all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries 

the service areas of aep’s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma tennessee texas virginia and west virginia the generating and transmission facilities of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are interconnected and their operations are coordinated transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served the public utility subsidiaries of aep have traditionally provided electric service consisting of generation transmission and distribution on an integrated basis to their retail customers restructuring legislation in michigan ohio and the ercot area of texas has caused aep public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers 

the aep system is an integrated electric utility system as a result the member companies of the aep system have contractual financial and other business relationships with the other member companies such as participation in the aep system savings and retirement plans and tax returns sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel the companies of the aep system also obtain certain accounting administrative information systems engineering financial legal maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider aepsc 

as of december 31 2012 the subsidiaries of aep had a total of 18513 employees because it is a holding company rather than an operating company aep has no employees the public utility subsidiaries of aep are

classes of service 

the principal classes of service from which the public utility subsidiaries of aep derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the year ended december 31 2012 are as follows 

 

 

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand borrowing under aeps revolving credit agreements and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2012 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and our access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and for aep and its significant subsidiaries a 50 million crossacceleration provision as of december 31 2012 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2012 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

  

  

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting our power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2 emissions of 89 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010 the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2 capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs we continue to meet our obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2 and no x emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many of our facilities we have installed additional controls and taken other actions to achieve compliance with these programs 

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25 standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new rule was signed by the administrator in december 2012 that lowers the annual standard a new ozone standard is also under development and is expected to be proposed in 2013 the federal epa also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2 in 2010  a lower standard for no x in 2010 and a lower standard for lead in 2008 the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011 the states will develop new sips for these standards which could result in additional emission reductions being required from our facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which requires additional reductions in so 2 and no x emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs for additional information regarding cair see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements in august 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that would impose new and more stringent requirements to control so 2 and no x emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 27 states and the district of columbia petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for 

  

  

the district of columbia circuit and csapr was vacated cair remains in effect until the federal epa develops a replacement rule for additional information regarding csapr see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

hazardous air pollutants 

as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants for additional information regarding the utility mact see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants 

pso is in the process of implementing a settlement with the federal epa in order to comply with the regional haze program requirements in that state for additional information regarding cavr and the regional haze program requirements see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

co 2 regulation 

in the absence of comprehensive climate change legislation the federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2 emissions under the existing requirements of the caa such actions are being legally challenged by numerous parties for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co 2 emissions see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – clean air act requirements 

our fossil fuelfired generating units are large sources of co 2 emissions if substantial co 2 emission reductions are required there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units to the extent we install additional controls on our generating plants to limit co 2 emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase our rates return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings prudently incurred capital investments made by our subsidiaries in rateregulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment we would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements however requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can affect us adversely because our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates to the extent our costs are relatively higher than our competitors’ costs it could reduce our offsystem sales or cause us to lose customers in jurisdictions that permit customers to choose their supplier of generation service 

several states have adopted programs that directly regulate co 2 emissions from power plants but none of these programs are currently in effect in states where we have generating facilities some of our states have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources arkansas indiana louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma texas virginia and west virginia we are taking steps to comply with these requirements primarily through entering into power supply agreements giving us access to power generated by wind turbines 

  

  

 

 

our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in our power plants in april 2011 the federal epa issued a proposed rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that will reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the proposed standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule the proposed standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a sitespecific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment we submitted comments on the proposal in july and august 2011 we expect the federal epa to issue revised rules in 2013 

the federal epa is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s national pollutant discharge elimination system program these standards were last updated over 20 years ago and the federal epa has issued two rounds of information collection requests to inform its rulemaking in october 2009 the federal epa issued a final report for the power plant sector and determined that revisions to its existing standards are necessary we expect the federal epa to propose revised standards in 2013 until new standards are proposed we cannot predict the outcome or impact of these rules on our operations 

coal ash regulation 

our operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials the federal epa completed an extensive study of the characteristics of coal ash in 2000 and concluded that combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous waste in december 2008 the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority’s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties prompting federal and state reviews of ash storage and disposal practices at many coalfired electric generating facilities including ours aep operates 37 ash ponds and we manage these ponds in a manner that complies with state and local requirements including dam safety rules designed to assure the structural integrity of these facilities we also operate a number of dry disposal facilities in accordance with state standards including ground water monitoring and other applicable standards in june 2010 the federal epa published a proposed rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on our operations see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – coal combustion residual rule 

climate change – position and strategy 

we continue to support a federal legislative approach to energy policy as the most effective means of reducing emissions of co 2 and other greenhouse gases generally referred to as co 2  that recognizes that a reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to economic recovery and growth we do not believe regulating co 2 emissions under the clean air act is the appropriate solution during the past decade we have taken voluntary actions to reduce and offset our co 2 emissions unfortunately two of the voluntary programs that helped businesses such as aep to set quantitative commitments no longer exist the federal epa’s climate leaders program and the chicago climate exchange both ended their reduction obligations at the end of 2010 however through these programs and others we voluntarily reduced our co 2 emissions by approximately 96 million metric tons during the 2003 to 2010 period we expect our emissions to continue to decline over time as we diversify our generating sources and operate fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals our strategy for this transformation is to protect the reliability of the electric system and reduce our emissions by pursuing multiple options these include diversifying our fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support meanwhile the federal epa began regulating co 2 emissions from large stationary sources such as power plants in 2012 under the nsr prevention of significant deterioration and title v operating permit programs 

  

  

in march 2012 the federal epa proposed a carbon pollution standard for new power plants this regulation based on epa authority under section 111b of the clean air act would establish new source performance standards for co 2 for new fossilfueledfired electric generating units the proposed regulation could limit the ability to construct new coalfired facilities in the future due to strict emission limits if finalized aep does not currently have plans to permit or construct any new coalfired facilities and the proposed rule does not directly impact existing facilities 

for additional information on legislative and regulatory responses to greenhouse gases including limitations on co 2 emissions see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings entitled environmental issues – climate change specific steps taken to reduce co 2 emissions include the following 

renewable sources of energy 

some of our states have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources arkansas indiana louisiana michigan ohio oklahoma texas virginia and west virginia at the end of 2012 and in support of our goals or requirements the company had longterm contracts for 1984 mw of wind and 10 mw of solar power for a combined total of 1994 mw to serve its regulated operating company customers we actively manage our compliance position and are on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction 

end user energy efficiency 

in 2008 aep established a goal to reduce demand by 1000 megawatts mw and energy consumption by 2250000 megawatthours mwh by the end of 2012 since that time aep operating companies have implemented a wide variety of new consumer programs across most of the states we serve over 100 energy efficiency and demand response programs and tariffs are now in place 

 

preliminary estimates indicate that we have achieved our goal from 2008 through 2012 aep achieved 3016400 mwh of energy reduction and 1011 mw of demand reduction or 134 and 101 of goal respectively for the same period aep operating companies have invested over 368 million in energy efficiency and demand response initiatives final results are subject to independent third party evaluation and verification of savings as required in some jurisdictions 

energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states we serve and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for us to continue and expand these consumer offerings appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments going forward we will work closely with regulators to ensure that plans are in place to meet specific regulatory and legislative energy efficiency andor demand reduction targets present in the respective jurisdictions 

  

  

gridsmart ® 

aep’s gridsmart ® initiative is designed to demonstrate the potential benefits of the smart grid by integrating advanced grid technologies into existing electric networks aep is deploying smart grid technologies in several jurisdictions with regulatory support 

 

 

 

 

current and projected co 2 emission 

our total co 2 emissions in 2011 not including our ownership in the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately 136 million metric tons our 2012 emissions decreased to approximately 122 million metric tons we expect overall increases in co 2 emissions during the next few years to be small if any as our sales and generation rebound somewhat from recession lows in 2009 however over much of the remainder of the decade we expect emissions to decline as modest sales growth is offset by retirements of older less efficient coalfired units and increased utilization of natural gas 

corporate governance 

in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of our strategic plan our board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by our actions the board of directors is informed of any new material environmental issues including changes to regulations and proposed legislation the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information on environmental issues 

other environmental issues and matters 

we are engaged in litigation regarding regulated air emissions andor whether emissions from coalfired generating plants cause or contribute to global warming see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled litigation – environmental issues and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2012 annual reports for further information 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2012 annual reports under the heading entitled the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund and state remediation for further information 

  

  

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2010 2011 and 2012 and the current estimates for 2013 2014 and 2015 are shown below in each case excluding equity afudc and capitalized interest estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2012 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2 becomes regulated at existing facilities while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could impact future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading entitled environmental issues and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2012 annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 

  

  

  

 

 

  

the preceding discussion of environmental investments and plans for future years reflects the ownership of plants as of december 31 2012 the aep east companies have filed with the ferc to terminate the interconnection agreement and for opco to transfer facilities to apco kpco and aepgenco management expects the transfers will be effective december 31 2013 

electric and magnetic fields emf 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances a number of studies in the past have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

  

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 

  

  

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include a the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and b the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2012 aep’s public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 37300 mw of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

interconnection agreement 

apco im kpco opco and aepsc are parties to the interconnection agreement which was originally approved by the ferc in 1951 and subsequently amended in 1951 1962 1975 1979 twice and 1980 this agreement defines how the member companies share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “member load ratio” the member load ratio is calculated monthly by dividing each company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all member companies the member load ratio multiplied by the aggregate generation capacity of all the member companies determines each member companys capacity obligation the difference between each member companys obligation and its own generation capacity determines the capacity surplus or deficit of each member company the agreement requires the deficit companies to make monthly capacity equalization payments to the surplus companies based on the surplus companies average fixed cost of generation member companies that deliver energy to other member companies to meet their internal load requirements are reimbursed at average variable costs in addition all member companies share offsystem sales margins based upon each member companys member load ratio consequently the agreement provides a strong risk sharing and mitigation arrangement among the member companies as of december 31 2012 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

apco im kpco and opco are parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement which has been approved by the ferc and provides among other things for the transfer of so 2 emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

  

termination of the interconnection agreement 

in october 2012 aep submitted several applications with the ferc requesting termination of the interconnection agreement termination of the allowance agreement approval of a new power coordination agreement among apco im and kpco and the transfer of opco’s generating assets to either a new wholly owned unregulated generation company or to apco and kpco to fully separate opco’s generating assets from its distribution and transmission operations see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2012 annual reports for additional information regarding the termination of the interconnection agreement and transfer of opco’s generation assets 

csw operating agreement 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to the csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale except in ohio where generation rates are currently priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market see regulation – rates under item 1 utility operations 

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading below for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east companies pso and swepco this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates and in adjacent regions these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent overthecounter swaps and options the majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting 

  

  

contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2012 counterparties posted approximately 8 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately   89 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the 2012 annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system 

 

a price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels aep’s overall 2012 fossil fuel costs are down approximately 2 on a dollar per mmbtu basis from 2011 due primarily to the favorable impact of low natural gas prices 

coal and lignite 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms coal consumption in 2012 was down significantly from the same period in 2011 for the reasons discussed below the aep system average target level for coal inventory ranges from 35 to 40 days and as of december 31 2012 the aep system average for coal inventories was 44 days 

management believes that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 7600 railcars approximately 600 barges 15 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities see aep river operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep’s utility operations segment 

spot market prices for certain coals utilized by aep decreased significantly in the first half of 2012 but made a modest recovery by the end of the year the general decrease in spot coal prices during the year can be attributed to the persistently weak demand for domestic coal driven in large part by low natural gas prices and the displacement of coal generation with natural gas resources most of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts as those contracts expire they can be replaced at the new market price with an impact in subsequent periods the average cost per ton for coal delivered in 2012 increased from the prior year 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by aep system companies 

 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries as of december 31 2012 the aep system’s coal inventory was approximately 44 days of full load burn 

  

  

natural gas 

through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed nearly 220 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2012 for generating power this represents an increase of 32 from 2011 and continues a trend that began in 2010 since 2009 aep’s natural gas consumption has increased approximately 130 the increased natural gas consumption is attributable to the addition of the stall and dresden natural gas combined cycle units in june 2010 and january 2012 respectively along with increased operation of the lawrenceburg and waterford combined cycle units the efficient heat rates of these units low 7000 british thermal unitskwh range coupled with sustained lower natural gas prices have supported the increased operation of aep’s combined cycle natural gas units a mild 201112 winter and the continuation of high levels of production from shale gas developments led to higher us natural gas inventories and continued to place downward pressure on natural gas prices as a result of more abundant supplies making power generated from these units more economic several of aep’s natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking commodity and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate 

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by aep system companies 

 

nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue im is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis im began and completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012 which consisted of 12 casks 32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program the most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2012 in it the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 13 billion to 17 billion in 2012 nondiscounted dollars as of december 31 2012 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 14 billion the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies included in the 2012 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available however the states of utah and texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from michigan waste generators there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to either of these facilities the cook plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste in the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and national power cooperatives npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc called the mone plant the mone plant began operations in 2002 opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2014 following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

certain power agreements 

im 

the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

opco 

the unit power agreement between aegco and opco dated march 15 2007 provides for the sale by aegco to opco of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to opco from the lawrenceburg plant a 1146 mw gasfired unit owned by aegco opco is obligated to pay a capacity charge whether or not power is available from the lawrenceburg plant and the fuel operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by opco and to reimburse aegco for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the lawrenceburg plant the agreement will continue in effect until december 31 2017 unless extended as set forth in the agreement 

  

  

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the united states department of energy the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each was extended by the owners in 2011 from the termination date of march 2026 until june 2040 aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests ovec’s board of directors has authorized capital expenditures totaling 14 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generating plants ovec has completed the financing of the 14 billion required for these projects through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances one ovec generating plant is operating with the new environmental controls with the second scheduled to be operational with the new environmental controls during the second quarter of 2013 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

other than aegco aep’s public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 – utility operations – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1 – utility operations – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

other than aegco aep’s public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 – utility operations – competition 

the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep east companies including wpco and kgpco are subject to the rules protocols and agreements in place with pjm and as approved by the ferc 

transmission coordination agreement oatt and ercot protocols 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to the tca under the tca a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of a overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement including the performance of transmission planning studies b the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and c compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff pursuant to the tca aepsc has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the oatt on behalf of the other parties to the agreement the tca also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the oatt these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp with respect to pso and swepco and puctapproved protocols for ercot with respect to tcc and tnc 

  

  

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated pursuant to the tca spp oatt and ercot protocols as described above for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 

transmission services for nonaffiliates 

in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 – utility operations – electric transmission and distribution – regional transmission organizations below transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission 

aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the ta and the tca aep’s system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

the aep east companies are members of pjm and swepco and pso are members of the spp both fercapproved rtos rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not the remaining aep west companies tcc and tnc are members of ercot 

regulation 

general 

except for transmission andor retail generation sales in certain of its jurisdictions aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions as well as certain unbundled retail transmission rates mainly in ohio im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact provides the ferc increased utility merger oversight 

  

  

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

in many jurisdictions the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in the ercot area of texas our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service only in ohio rates for electric service are unbundled for generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2012 annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

ohio 

opco provides “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio electric restructuring legislation opco provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at costbased rates approved by the puco or by the ferc while ohio transmission and distribution services continue to be established using more traditional costbased methods generation rates are currently priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market we are seeking regulatory approval from the ferc to transfer the ohio generation assets to a newly formed wholly owned competitive ohio generation affiliate as of january 1 2014 the recovery of those generation assets will be subject to market prices starting in midmay 2015 

  

  

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales the factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 

texas 

retail customers in tcc’s and tnc’s ercot service area of texas are served through reps tcc and tnc provide transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules effective september 2009 competition in the spp area of texas has been delayed until certain steps defined by statute and by puct rule have been accomplished as such the puct continues to approve base and fuel rates for swepco’s texas operations on a cost of service basis 

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

  

  

the following table illustrates certain regulatory information with respect to the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

ferc 

under the federal power act the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its balancing area of the spp aep has marketrate authority from the ferc under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an open access sametime information system which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals the aep east companies are members of pjm swepco and pso are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc increased utility merger oversight 

competition 

under current ohio law electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service cres providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service in 2011 based upon an average annual load approximately 10 of our ohio load had switched to cres providers as of december 31 2012 that amount had increased to 51 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through 

  

  

for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission operations 

aeptco overview 

aeptco a subsidiary of aep is a holding company for seven fercregulated transmissiononly electric utilities each of which is geographically aligned with our existing utility operating companies aeptco is an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of aep aeptco’s seven whollyowned transmissiononly public utility companies transcos are 

aep east transmission companies all operating within pjm 

 

 

 

 

 

aep west transmission companies all operating within spp 

 

 

the transcos develop own and operate transmission assets that are physically connected to aep’s existing system they are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the ferc and employ a forwardlooking formula rate tariff design the transcos are independent of but overlay aep’s existing verticallyintegrated utility operating companies imtco ohtco oktco and wvtco have received all necessary approvals for formation imtco ohtco and oktco currently own and operate transmission assets aptco has received approval from the virginia scc although the approval requires aptco to request projectbyproject approval from the virginia scc applications for regulatory approvals have been filed for the remaining transcos and are currently under consideration in arkansas kentucky and louisiana as of december 31 2012 aeptco had 378   million of transmission assets inservice with plans to construct nearly 19 billion of additional transmission assets through 2015 

capital investment strategy 

all of the transcos’ capital needs are provided by parent aeptco andor the aep utility money pool the utility money pool is used to meet the shortterm borrowing needs of aep regulated utility subsidiaries the utility money pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions approved in regulatory orders we forecast approximately 700 million excluding afudc of construction expenditures in 2013 for the transcos 

  

  

in october 2012 aeptco completed a 250 million debt offering and immediately loaned 200 million and 50 million in proceeds to ohtco and imtco respectively in december 2012 aeptco issued an additional 75 million in debt and immediately loaned the proceeds to oktco aptco will issue an additional 25 million in march 2013 but it is not yet determined which subsidiaries of aeptco will receive the proceeds 

transmission development through the transcos is primarily driven by 

 

 

 

regulatory environment 

the transcos establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the ferc pursuant to the fercapproved formula rate implementation protocols ferc has a formal review process in place to ensure updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated the annual updates are submitted to pjm and spp respectively for public posting on their respective websites and submitted to ferc in an informational filing any interested party may participate in the review of the annual update and must comply with defined timelines to request additional information on such rate updates 

an oatt is the ferc rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system for the transcos pjm or spp ferc requires transmission providers to offer transmission service to all eligible customers ie loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers in states with supplier choice on a nondiscriminatory basis the pjm and spp oatts provide standard terms and conditions to ensure consistent service availability and treatment of all transmission customers 

the transcos’ rates are included in the respective oatt for pjm and spp pjm and spp collect the transcos’ rates from transmission customers taking service under the pjm and spp oatts based on the terms and conditions in the respective oatts for the service taken some charges are directly assigned to a transmission customer but the majority of the charges are paid by transmission customers taking transmission service to serve load deliver power or to connect generation resources 

the ferc establishes transmission service rates for transmission owners including the transcos as derived from their annual transmission revenue requirement atrr each of the transcos’ atrr establishes rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe the atrr also includes a trueup calculation during the annual formula update for the previous year’s billings eliminating any potential for over or underrecovery of the allowed return on and of the plant inservice the transcos collectively filed rate base increases of 283 million and 104 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively the total transmission revenue requirement filed in the atrr for 2012 and 2011 equaled 35 million and 13 million respectively 

the cost of service formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 1149 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity for the aep east transmission companies the aep west transmission companies are allowed a return on equity of 1120 based on a capital structure of up to 50 equity the authorized returns on equity for the transcos are commensurate with the fercauthorized returns on equity in the pjm and spp oatts respectively for aep’s utility subsidiaries 

joint venture initiatives 

aep has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning extra high voltage ehv transmission lines that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in north america our joint ventures are at various stages of regulatory and rto approval 

  

  

ett our largest joint venture was established with midamerican energy holdings company midamerican to construct fund own and operate electric transmission assets within ercot including transmission projects in the competitive renewable energy zone crez the puct has awarded approximately 15 billion of total crez investment to ett aep has a 50 ownership interest in ett 

electric transmission america eta is a joint venture between aep and midamerican to build and own electric transmission assets prairie wind transmission a joint venture between eta and westar energy began construction of a kansas ehv transmission project in 2012 the approximately 180 million project is expected to be in service by the end of 2014 aep has a 50 ownership interest in eta and a 25 interest in prairie wind through its ownership interest in eta 

pioneer transmission llc pioneer is a joint venture between aep and duke energy aep has a 50 ownership interest in pioneer the first segment of pioneer’s proposed line linking duke energy’s greentown station to aep’s rockport station was included in the 2011 miso transmission expansion plan as a multivalue project mvp subject to regulatory approval pioneer has agreed to jointly develop the first segment with northern indiana public service company as part of the settlement of a dispute regarding the rights to develop the project the remaining portion of the project will be evaluated by miso and pjm as part of their next planning review cycles the estimated cost to complete the entire pioneer project is 950 million 

riteline transmission development llc rtd is a joint venture between aep and exelon aep owns 50 of rtd riteline indiana llc riteline in is a joint venture between aep and rtd aep directly and indirectly through rtd has an 875 ownership interest in riteline in riteline illinois llc riteline il is a joint venture between rtd and commonwealth edison through its ownership interest in rtd aep has a 125 interest in riteline il the riteline project companies will build and operate approximately 420 miles of highvoltage transmission lines and related facilities in indiana with a projected cost of 400 million and illinois with a projected cost of 12 billion rtd received an order from the ferc in october 2011 granting incentives for the riteline in and riteline il projects the projects are currently under evaluation by pjm 

transource energy llc transource a joint venture between aep and great plains energy was formed in 2012 primarily to pursue competitive transmission projects in the pjm spp and miso transmission regions its first two projects are the iatannashua project and the sibleynebraska city project which were approved by the spp in 2009 and 2010 respectively aep has an 865 ownership interest and great plains energy incorporated holds a minority ownership interest in transource 

business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and other aep subsidiaries and the joint venture partners therefore the joint ventures do not have any employees for the equity investments within our transmission operations segment we forecast approximately 55 million of aep equity contributions in 2013 to support construction expenditures and the payment of operating expenses 

aep river operations 

our aep river operations segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants aep river operations includes approximately 2500 barges 45 towboats and 25 harbor boats that we own or lease these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment see item 1 – utility operations – electric generation – fuel supply – coal and lignite 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to   customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national 

  

  

customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather water levels and inefficient older river locks operated by others may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed or commercial traffic is limited 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

generation and marketing 

our generation and marketing segment consists of nonutility generating assets a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business with respect to our wholesale energy trading and marketing business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in ercot pjm and miso as of december 31 2012 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 mw of companyowned domestic wind power facilities 177 mw of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 377 mw of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers tnc’s interest   in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations with respect to our retail supply and energy management business aep energy is a retail electricity supplier that supplies electricity to residential commercial and industrial customers aep energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in illinois pennsylvania delaware maryland new jersey ohio and washington dc aep energy also provides energy demandside management solutions nationwide aep energy had more than 160000 customer accounts as of december 31 2012

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions – affecting each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

approval of the new esp order in ohio may be overturned – affecting aep and opco 

in august 2012 the puco issued an order which adopted and modified a new esp through may 2015 the esp allowed the continuation of the fuel adjustment clause and established a nonbypassable distribution investment rider effective september 2012 through may 2015 to recover with certain caps postaugust 2010 distribution investment the esp also maintained recovery of several previous esp riders and approved a storm damage recovery mechanism which allowed opco to defer the majority of the incremental distribution operation and maintenance costs from 2012 storms in january 2013 the puco issued its order on rehearing for the esp which generally upheld its august 2012 order the puco addressed certain issues around the energy auctions while other sso issues were deferred to a separate docket comments on the rehearing order are permitted to be filed by intervenors through march 2013 if the puco   reverses all or part of the esp rehearing order it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not fully collect deferred capacity costs – affecting aep and opco 

the puco adopted and modified the new esp and established a nonbypassable retail stability rider rsr a portion of the rsr provides for the collection of deferred capacity costs the deferred capacity costs may exceed the amount we will collect under the rsr in addition the industrial energy usersohio filed a claim before the supreme court of ohio stating among other things that opco’s recovery of its capacity costs is illegal if opco is ultimately not permitted to fully collect its deferred capacity costs it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not recover deferred fuel costs – affecting aep and opco 

in august 2012 the puco ordered recovery of deferred fuel costs beginning september 2012 through the phasein recovery rider the august 2012 order was upheld by the puco in october 2012 opco and intervenors have filed appeals at the supreme court of ohio if the supreme court of ohio does not permit full recovery of opco’s deferred fuel costs it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

prior esp rate recovery approved in ohio may have to be returned may not provide full recovery of costs and is subject to appeal – affecting aep and opco 

the puco issued an order in march 2009 that modified and approved the prior esp which established rates through 2011 the prior esp order generally authorized rate increases during the esp period subject to caps that limited the rate increases and also provided a fuel adjustment clause for the threeyear period of that esp there remain three risks associated with this prior approved recovery a amounts collected by us for the years 2010 and 2011 are subject to an excessive earnings test administered by the puco which could require us to refund amounts to customers b the recovery under the fuel adjustment clause includes significant deferrals of costs associated with an interim arrangement with a major steel producing customer and is subject to the puco’s ultimate decision regarding those deferrals plus related carrying charges and c intervenors are challenging various issues at the supreme court of ohio asserting that charges that the puco reversed going forward also should have been 

  

  

reversed retrospectively and challenging various aspects of approved environmental carrying charges if the puco andor the supreme court of ohio reverses all or part of the rate recovery or if deferred amounts are not recovered for other reasons it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

ohio may require us to refund additional fuel costs – affecting aep and opco 

in january 2012 the puco ordered that proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement be applied against opco’s underrecovered fuel balance and that an outside consultant be hired to review our fuel procurement through 2011 the audit by the outside consultant included recommendations that would limit some of our fuel recovery or require us to refund certain fuel costs already incurred in addition an intervenor filed a claim for refund of certain fuel costs with the supreme court of ohio if the puco orders result in a reduction to our fuel recovery andor the supreme court of ohio ultimately determines to grant all or part of the requested refund it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to the turk plant – affecting aep and swepco 

in december 2012 swepco placed the turk plant in arkansas into commercial operation swepco holds a 73 ownership interest in the 600 mw coalfired generating facility swepco had originally intended that 88 mw of the turk plant would become part of the rate base for its retail customers in arkansas following a proceeding at the arkansas supreme court the apsc issued an order which reversed and set aside a previously granted certificate of environmental compatibility and public need this portion of the turk plant output is currently not subject to cost based rate recovery and is being sold into the spp market swepco has included a request to recover a portion of the costs of the turk plant in its base rate case filed in texas and has made a formula rate filing with the lpsc and a subsequent settlement seeking recovery for a portion of the costs of the turk plant if swepco cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the turk plant either through retail rates or sales into the spp market it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not fully recover all of the investment in and expenses related to extending the useful life of the cook plant – affecting aep and im 

in april and may 2012 im filed a petition with the iurc and the mpsc respectively for approval of the cook plant life cycle management project lcm project which consists of a group of capital projects for cook plant units 1 and 2 intended to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the plant through its licensed life the estimated cost of the lcm project is 12 billion to be incurred through 2018 excluding afudc as of december 31 2012 im has incurred 176 million related to the lcm project including afudc if im is not ultimately permitted to recover its lcm project costs it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

request for rate recovery in texas may not be approved in its entirety – affecting aep and swepco 

in july 2012 swepco filed a request with the puct for an annual increase in texas base rates a portion of the increase seeks recovery for costs associated with the construction and operation of the texas jurisdictional share approximately 33 of the turk plant in april 2012 the texas industrial energy consumers filed a petition for review at the supreme court of texas contending that the turk plant is unnecessary to serve retail customers the supreme court of texas has requested full briefing from the parties if swepco cannot recover all of its investment and expenses related to the turk plant it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our transmission investment strategy and execution bears certain risks associated with these activities – affecting aep 

we expect that a growing portion of our earnings in the future will derive from the transmission investments and activities of aeptco and our transmission joint ventures ferc policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction if ferc were to adopt a different policy or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected our strategy of investing in transmission could be curtailed we believe our experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives us an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities 

  

  

however there can be no assurance that pjm spp or other rtos will authorize any new transmission projects or will award any such projects to us if the ferc were to lower the rate of return it has authorized for our transmission investments and facilities it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled – affecting each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects is canceled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition if we have recorded any construction work or investments as an asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements additions storm damage operations and maintenance expense repairs and other costs – affecting each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus commissionapproved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered traditionally we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery similarly we often finance the operations and maintenance expense to repair facilities damaged by storms or other severe weather events until the operations and maintenance storm costs including any deferred regulatory assets are recovered in rates long lead times in construction and scheduled repairs the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments repairs and improvements while we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow including preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates there can be no assurance that these will be adopted that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner 

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control – affecting each registrant 

our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities however could negatively impact our revenues operating and capital expenditures and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials we could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk – affecting aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or about 6 of the generating capacity in the aep system we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect our performance in these regions – affecting each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards – affecting each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc these standards which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis became mandatory in june 2007 the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

  

  

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions – affecting each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation transmission and distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair our operations lead to the disclosure of confidential   information and damage our reputation – affecting each registrant 

we own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems further the computer systems that run our facilities are not completely isolated from external networks parties that wish to disrupt the us bulk power system or our operations could view our computer systems software or networks as attractive targets for cyber attack in addition our business requires that we collect and maintain sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 

a successful cyber attack on the systems that control our generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing us from serving customers or collecting revenues the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record process and report financial information a major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation in addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring we maintain property and casualty insurance that may cover certain physical damage or third party injuries caused by potential cybersecurity incidents however other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available for these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

in an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions we have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality integrity and availability of data and systems in addition we are subject to mandatory cybersecurity regulatory requirements however cyber threats continue to evolve and adapt and as a result there is a risk that we could experience a successful cyber attack despite our current security posture and regulatory compliance efforts 

  

  

if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition – affecting each registrant 

we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses – affecting each registrant 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive in periods of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt or on the investment grade ratings of aep parent most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries – affecting aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep could be subject to regulatory restrictions aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations if any 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions – affecting each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions 

  

  

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance – affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures as long as current environmental programs remain in effect we have sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of our projected needs for the next two years and beyond if the federal epa is able to create a replacement rule to reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions if we need to obtain allowances under a replacement rule those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which exposes us to market prices of natural gas historically natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources recently however the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened price volatility our ability to make offsystem sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our offsystem sales prices so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and on occasion we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants we expect the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility will have a longterm material effect on the price and volatility of natural gas 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results 

  

  

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

our aep river operations business segment cannot operate if river levels are too low or too high – affecting aep 

our aep river operations business segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers if drought conditions or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to drop below the amount necessary to permit commercial barging traffic it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river conversely if unusually high amounts of precipitation or other factors cause the water levels of one or more of these rivers to be too high to permit commercial barging traffic it would prevent our aep river operations from transporting cargo on the affected river extreme water levels that do not close river basin commercial traffic can still harm our business if the levels curtail the total volume permitted to move on the affected river the levels on portions of the mississippi river in 2013 have been reported as the lowest since the levels caused by severe drought in 1988 any reduction in the commercial activities of our aep river operations due to low water levels could reduce future net income and cash flows 

risks relating to state restructuring 

we are unable to fully predict the effects of corporate separation in ohio and ohio generation becoming subject to market forces – affecting aep and opco 

while ohio rates for transmission and distribution services continue to be established using a more traditional costbased method in october 2012 the puco approved opco’s corporate separation plan to transfer its generation assets to a new competitive unregulated generation affiliate during this transition generation rates will be priced using a hybrid approach that incorporates components of cost and market starting in mid2015 generation rates will be subject entirely to market prices we have made additional filings at the ferc and other state commissions related to this corporate separation if all regulatory approvals are received our results of operations related to generation previously held by opco will be largely determined by the prevailing market conditions we can give no assurance that the ferc will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving our corporate separation filings additionally some of these generation units may no longer be cost effective and may be retired prior to the end of their anticipated useful life this could result in material impairments 

we are unable to fully predict the effects of terminating the interconnection agreement – affecting aep apco im and opco 

in october 2012 we submitted several filings with the ferc seeking approval to fully separate opco’s generating assets from its distribution and transmission operations the filings requested approval to transfer approximately 9200 mw of opcoowned generation assets to a new competitive unregulated generation affiliate we also requested approval from the ferc and as applicable the kpsc the virginia scc and the wvpsc to transfer 1647 mw of opcoowned generation assets to apco and 780 mw of opcoowned generation assets to kpco additionally we asked for ferc approval to terminate the existing interconnection agreement and to authorize a new power coordination agreement among apco im and kpco a decision from the ferc is expected in mid2013 significant gaps could emerge if the interconnection agreement is terminated without approval of the generation asset transfers andor the new power coordination agreement surplus members would no longer automatically sell to deficit members and they may not be able to otherwise sell that surplus in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the interconnection agreement conversely deficit members would no longer automatically purchase from surplus members and they may not be able to otherwise purchase in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the interconnection agreement the possible loss of these sales by the surplus members and the potential increase in costs for the deficit members could reduce future net income and cash flows in addition we can give no assurance that the ferc or other state commissions will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving these arrangements and asset transfers 

  

  

customers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers as allowed by ohio law and regulation – affecting aep and opco 

under current ohio law electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service cres providers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service as of december 31 2012 based upon an average annual load approximately 51 of our ohio load had switched to cres providers these evolving market conditions will continue to impact our results of operations 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps – affecting aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately one hundred reps in 2012 tcc’s largest rep accounted for 16 of its operating revenue and its second largest rep accounted for 7 of its operating revenue tnc’s largest rep accounted for 19 of its operating revenues and its second largest rep accounted for 12 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could reduce future cash flows and impact financial condition 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant – affecting each registrant 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations costs of compliance with environmental regulations could reduce future net income and impact financial condition especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase if we retire generating plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions either through legislation or by the federal epa could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain – affecting each registrant 

the us congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control co 2 emissions since 2009 in december 2009 the federal epa issued a final endangerment finding under the caa regarding emissions from motor vehicles the federal epa also finalized co 2 emission standards for new motor vehicles and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of co 2 emissions in a phased manner through 2014 several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the federal epa’s subsequent rulemakings in 2012 the federal epa issued a proposed co 2 emissions standard for new power generation sources with a co 2 limit equivalent to a natural gas unit a final rule is expected in the first half of 2013 management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major us industrial enterprises including us and our customers 

  

  

if co 2 and other emission standards are imposed the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units while we expect that costs of complying with new co 2 and other greenhouse gases emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our co 2 emissions – affecting each registrant 

in the past there have been several cases and currently there is one pending case seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we among others are defendants in general the actions allege that co 2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance due to impacts of global warming and climate change the plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief if the pending or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce co 2 emissions such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers this could have a material impact on our costs in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control – affecting each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities – affecting each registrant 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power – affecting each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities – affecting each registrant 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

  

  

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market 

financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations – affecting each registrant 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law doddfrank act the federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets and significantly alter how overthecounter otc derivatives are regulated the law increased regulatory oversight of otc energy derivatives including a imposing pervasive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc on dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps b requiring certain standardized otc derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges as directed by cftc c imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements on swap dealers and traders who hold significant positions in swaps and d increasing the monitoring and compliance obligations of parties who engage in swaps including new recordkeeping and reporting requirements with governmental entities the cftc has issued regulations exempting certain end users of energy commodities from being required to clear otc derivatives provided that they a are using the swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and b satisfy certain other requirements to the extent we meet such requirements the end user exemption could reduce the effect of the laws clearing requirements on our hedging activity pursuant to authority granted under the doddfrank act the cftc has also issued rules that among other things further define the otc derivative products and entities subject to additional regulatory oversight which recently became effective these requirements could subject us to additional regulatory oversight related to our otc derivative transactions cause our otc derivative transactions to be more costly and have an impact on financial condition due to additional capital requirements in addition as these reforms aim to standardize otc products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor otc derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission lines of ett ohtco and oktco 

 

title to property 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the aep system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 36 billion of construction expenditures for 2013 excluding equity afudc capitalized interest and assets acquired under leases estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather legal reviews and the ability to access capital 

  

  

construction expenditures 

the following table shows construction expenditures including environmental expenditures during 2012 2011 and 2010 and a current estimate of 2013 construction expenditures actual amounts for 2012 2011 and 2010 and budgeted amounts for 2013 exclude equity afudc capitalized interest and assets acquired under leases 

 

the aep system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand business and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital environmental requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules and costs and in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities as well as variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal income and other taxes and other factors affecting cash requirements may increase or decrease the estimated capital requirements for the aep system’s construction program 

potential uninsured losses 

some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to our generating plants and costs of replacement power unless allowed to be recovered through rates future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of aep and other aep system companies for risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance

organized in west virginia in 1883 and reincorporated in 1911 wpco provides electric service to approximately 41000 retail customers in northern west virginia wpco does not own any generating facilities wpco is a member of pjm it purchases electric power from opco for distribution to its customers at december 31 2011 wpco had 52 employees in february 2012 wpco filed an application with the ferc seeking authorization to merge with and into apco the merger is expected to require the approval of the wvpsc and the virginia scc 

aegco 

organized in ohio in 1982 aegco is an electric generating company aegco sells power at wholesale to opco im and kpco aegco has no employees 

service company subsidiary 

aep also owns a service company subsidiary aepsc aepsc provides accounting administrative information systems engineering financial legal maintenance and other services at cost to the aep affiliated companies the executive officers of aep and certain of its public utility subsidiaries are employees of aepsc at december 31 2011 aepsc had 4977 employees 

  

  

classes of service 

the principal classes of service from which the public utility subsidiaries of aep derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the year ended december 31 2011 are as follows 

 

 

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand borrowing under aeps revolving credit agreements and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see “financial condition” section management’s financial discussion and analysis included in the 2011 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and our access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and for aep and its significant subsidiaries a 50 million crossacceleration provision at december 31 2011 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s financial discussion and analysis included in the 2011 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

  

  

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting our power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program 

the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2 emissions of 89 million tons per year the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2 capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs we continue to meet our obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by the federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2 and nox emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many of our facilities we have installed additional controls and taken other actions to achieve compliance with these programs 

national ambient air quality standards 

the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin the federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25 standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new standard is under development a new ozone standard is also under development and is expected to be finalized in 2013 the federal epa also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2 in 2010  a lower standard for no 2 in 2010 and a lower standard for lead in 2008 the existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011 the states will develop new sips for these standards which could result in additional emission reductions being required from our facilities   

 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which requires additional reductions in so 2 and no x emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs for additional information regarding cair see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – clean air act requirements in august 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule to replace cair the cross state air pollution rule csapr that would impose new and more stringent requirements to control so 2 and no x emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 27 states and the district of columbia petitions for review were filed with the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 

  

  

  

circuit and csapr was stayed cair remains in effect until further order from the court for additional information regarding csapr see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – clean air act requirements 

hazardous air pollutants 

as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2011 the federal epa issued a final rule setting maximum achievable control technology mact standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and new source performance standards nsps for emissions from new and modified power plants for additional information regarding the utility mact see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – clean air act requirements 

regional haze 

the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants for additional information regarding cavr see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – clean air act requirements 

in december 2011 the federal epa issued a partial approval and partial disapproval of the oklahoma sip for regional haze and a federal implementation plan fip for the so 2 requirements that were disapproved the federal epa has also proposed to disapprove the best available retrofit technology determinations for the coalfired power plants in arkansas but has not proposed a fip for these units the requirements of the fip that apply to our oklahoma units impose significantly greater costs than would have been incurred under the oklahoma sip we are unable to predict whether a fip will be developed to satisfy cavr in arkansas or how it may affect our compliance obligations for the regional haze program 

greenhouse gas emissions 

in the absence of comprehensive climate change legislation the federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2 emissions under the existing requirements of the caa such actions are being legally challenged by numerous parties for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate co 2 emissions see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – clean air act requirements 

our fossil fuelfired generating units are large sources of co 2 emissions if substantial co 2 emission reductions are required there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units to the extent we install additional controls on our generating plants to limit co 2 emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase our rates return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings prudently incurred capital investments made by our subsidiaries in rateregulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment we would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements however requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can affect us adversely because our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates to the extent our costs are relatively higher than our competitors’ costs such as operators of nuclear generation it could reduce our offsystem sales or cause us to lose customers in jurisdictions that permit customers to choose their supplier of generation service 

  

  

several states have adopted programs that directly regulate co 2 emissions from power plants but none of these programs are currently in effect in states where we have generating facilities certain states including ohio michigan texas and virginia passed legislation establishing renewable energy alternative energy andor energy efficiency requirements we are taking steps to comply with these requirements primarily through entering into power supply agreements giving us access to power generated by wind turbines 

 

our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in our power plants in april 2011 the federal epa issued a proposed rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that will reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water the proposed standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule the proposed standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a sitespecific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment we submitted comments on the proposal in july and august 2011 

in july 2007 the federal epa affirmed the requirement that permitting agencies develop best professional judgment bpj controls for existing facility cooling water intake structures that reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact the result is that the bpj control standard for cooling water intake structures in effect prior to the rule is used as the applicable standard by permitting agencies pending finalization of revised rules by the federal epa 

in april 2009 the us supreme court issued a decision that allows the federal epa the discretion to rely on costbenefit analysis in setting national performance standards and in providing for costbenefit variances from those standards as part of the regulations we cannot predict if or how the federal epa will apply this decision to any revision of the regulations or what effect it may have on similar requirements adopted by the states we expect the federal epa to issue revised rules in 2012 

the federal epa is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s national pollutant discharge elimination system program these standards were last updated over 20 years ago and the federal epa has issued two rounds of information collection requests to inform its rulemaking in october 2009 the federal epa issued a final report for the power plant sector and determined that revisions to its existing standards are necessary but the federal epa has not yet proposed any specific requirements until new standards are proposed we cannot predict the outcome or impact of these rules on our operations 

coal ash regulation 

our operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials the federal epa completed an extensive study of the characteristics of coal ash in 2000 and concluded that combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous waste in december 2008 the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority’s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties prompting federal and state reviews of ash storage and disposal practices at many coalfired electric generating facilities including ours aep operates 37 ash ponds and we manage these ponds in a manner that complies with state and local requirements including dam safety rules designed to assure the structural integrity of these facilities we also operate a number of dry disposal facilities in accordance with state standards including ground water monitoring and other applicable standards in june 2010 the federal epa published a proposed rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units for additional information regarding the federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on our operations see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – coal combustion residual rule 

  

  

 

we continue to support a federal legislative approach to energy policy as the most effective means of reducing emissions of co 2 and other greenhouse gases generally referred to as co 2  that recognizes that a reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to economic recovery and growth we do not believe regulating co 2 emissions under the clean air act is the appropriate solution during the past decade we have taken voluntary actions to reduce and offset our co 2 emissions unfortunately two of the voluntary programs that helped businesses such as aep to set quantitative commitments no longer exist the federal epa’s climate leaders program and the chicago climate exchange both ended their reduction obligations at the end of 2010 however through these programs and others we voluntarily reduced our co 2 emissions by approximately 94 million metric tons during the 2003 to 2010 period we expect our emissions to continue to decline over time as we diversify our generating sources and operate fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals our strategy for this transformation is to protect the reliability of the electric system and reduce our emissions by pursuing multiple options these include diversifying our fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support meanwhile the federal epa began regulating co 2 emissions from large stationary sources such as power plants in 2012 under the nsr prevention of significant deterioration and title v operating permit programs 

for additional information on legislative and regulatory responses to greenhouse gases including limitations on co 2 emissions see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – global warming specific steps taken to reduce co 2 emissions include the following 

renewable sources of energy 

some of our states have laws or commission orders that establish requirements or goals for renewable andor alternative energy louisiana ohio arkansas michigan west virginia texas indiana virginia and oklahoma and we are taking steps to comply with these rules in a timely fashion a key sustainability commitment we made was to increase renewable power by an additional 2000 mw from 2007 levels by 2011 subject to regulatory approval by the end of 2011 aep secured only 1500 mw of renewable power through power purchase agreements 

end user energy efficiency 

energy efficiency is a high priority for aep because it can be a costeffective way to reduce energy demand and potentially delay the need for new power plants we work collaboratively with regulators technical experts environmental groups and others to develop and implement efficiency and demand response programs from 2008 through 2011 we have achieved approximately 716 mw and 1972000 mwh of demand and energy reductions respectively we have an internal goal to reduce 1000 mw of demand and 2250000 mwh of energy consumption by yearend 2012 we expect to surpass our energy reduction goal subject to regulatory approvals appropriate cost recovery and continued customer demand for programs in 2011 we invested over 115 million throughout most of our service territory in energy efficiency and demand response initiatives 

  

  

gridsmart ® 

aep’s gridsmart ® initiative is designed to demonstrate the potential benefits of the smart grid by integrating advanced grid technologies into existing electric networks aep is deploying smart grid technologies in several jurisdictions with regulatory support 

 

 

 

 

current and projected co 2 emission 

our total co 2 emissions in 2010 including our ownership in the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately 140 million metric tons our 2011 emissions remained flat at approximately 141 million metric tons we expect overall increases in co 2 emissions during the next few years to be small if any as our sales and generation rebound somewhat from recession lows in 2009 however over much of the remainder of the decade we expect emissions to decline as modest sales growth is offset by retirements of older less efficient coalfired units and increased utilization of natural gas 

corporate governance 

our board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by and our actions in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of our strategic plan the board of directors is frequently informed of any new material environmental issues including changes to regulations and proposed legislation the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information on environmental issues 

other environmental issues and matters 

 

 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2009 2010 and 2011 and the current estimates for 2012 2013 and 2014 are shown below in each case excluding equity afudc and capitalized interest estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access 

  

  

  

capital aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2011 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2 becomes regulated while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the heading entitled environmental matters and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2011 annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 

 

 

 

electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances a number of studies in the past have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include a the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and b the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

  

  

electric generation 

facilities 

as of december 31 2011 aep’s public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 37000 mw of domestic generation see item 2 – properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

aep power pool 

apco im kpco opco and aepsc are parties to the interconnection agreement which was originally approved by the ferc in 1951 and subsequently amended in 1951 1962 1975 1979 twice and 1980 this agreement defines how the member companies share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “member load ratio” the member load ratio is calculated monthly by dividing each company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all member companies the member load ratio multiplied by the aggregate generation capacity of all the member companies determines each member companys capacity obligation the difference between each member companys obligation and its own generation capacity determines the capacity surplus or deficit of each member company the agreement requires the deficit companies to make monthly capacity equalization payments to the surplus companies based on the surplus companies average fixed cost of generation member companies that deliver energy to other member companies to meet their internal load requirements are reimbursed at average variable costs in addition all member companies share offsystem sales margins based upon each member companys member load ratio consequently the agreement provides a strong risk sharing and mitigation arrangement among the member companies as of december 31 2011 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

apco im kpco and opco are parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement which has been approved by the ferc and provides among other things for the transfer of so 2 emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

  

notification of termination of the aep power pool 

the regulatory landscape and business environment have changed extensively since the interconnection agreement was originally executed in 1951 these changes include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

consequently in december 2010 each aep power pool member gave written notice to the other members and aepsc the pool’s agent of its decision to terminate the interconnection agreement effective january 1 2014 or such other date as approved by ferc subject to state regulatory input the pool agreement members unanimously have agreed to waive the full threeyear notice provision because the interconnection agreement is a rate schedule on file at ferc its termination will not be effective until accepted for filing by ferc final resolution could involve bilateral contracts or sales of generating assets from surplus members to deficit members 

additionally the aep east companies have decided to terminate the allowance agreement 

 

csw operating agreement 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to the csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale see regulation – rates under item 1 utility operations 

  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading below for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east companies pso and swepco this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to 

  

  

  

third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates and in adjacent regions these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by netting into offsetting contracts these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2011 counterparties have posted approximately 16 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately   171 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s financial discussion and analysis included in the 2011 annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk management activities for additional information 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system 

 

price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in increased use of other fuels the decreased generation of nuclear power in 2009 is primarily related to a 2008 forced outage caused by a low pressure turbine blade failure event and the impacted unit coming back on line in 2010 

coal and lignite 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms coal consumption was in line with the projected fuel usage in 2011 and coal inventories ended 2011 near target levels 

management believes that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through its public utility subsidiaries as of december 31 2011 aep owned leased or controlled more than 7600 railcars 634 barges 16 towboats and a coal handling terminal with 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities see aep river operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep’s utility operations segment 

  

spot market prices for certain coals utilized by aep fluctuated in a fairly narrow band throughout much of the year but softened noticeably in the fourth quarter the general increase in spot coal prices seen over the past few years has been supported by higher international demand for us coals and increased mining costs related to regulatory and permitting issues most of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts the price paid under a number of these contracts is often lower than the spot market price for similar coal as term contracts expire they are replaced with new agreements often at higher prices the price paid for coal delivered in 2011 increased from the prior year reflective of market price trending 

  

  

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by aep system companies 

 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries at december 31 2011 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 39 days of full load burn 

in cases of emergency or shortage aep has developed programs to conserve coal supplies at its plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with federally approved electric reliability organizations in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

natural gas 

through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed nearly 167 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2011 for generating power this represents an increase of 25 from 2010 and continues a trend that began in 2010 when aep’s natural gas consumption increased 40 above the 2009 level the increased natural gas consumption is primarily due to the addition of the stall natural gas combined cycle unit at swepco in june 2010 along with increased operation of the lawrenceburg and waterford combined cycle units in the east apco’s dresden plant a new 580 mw combinedcycle natural gas generating unit in ohio was completed and placed in service in january 2012 the efficient heat rates of these units coupled with sustained lower natural gas prices have supported the increased operation of aep’s combined cycle natural gas units during 2011 increased production from shale gas development continues to place downward pressure on natural gas prices as a result of more abundant supplies making power generated from these units more economic many of the natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of term monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate 

  

the following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by aep system companies 

 

  

  

nuclear 

im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im anticipates that the cook plant has sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations through 2013 im has entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks is scheduled to begin in 2012 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program in 2009 when the most recent study was done the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 831 million to 15 billion in 2009 nondiscounted dollars at december 31 2011 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 13 billion the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies included in the 2011 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste 

the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available but utah licenses a lowlevel radioactive waste disposal site which currently accepts lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan im ships some of its low level waste to a facility in utah there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to the utah facility im stores the remaining type of lowlevel waste onsite in order to have capacity for the duration of its licensed operation of cook plant for onsite storage of waste not shipped to utah im will have to modify its existing facilities sometime in the next ten to fifteen years 

  

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc called the mone plant opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2012 as extended following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

  

  

certain power agreements 

im 

the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

opco 

the unit power agreement between aegco and opco dated march 15 2007 provides for the sale by aegco to opco of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to opco from the lawrenceburg plant opco is obligated to pay a capacity charge whether or not power is available from the lawrenceburg plant and the fuel operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by opco and to reimburse aegco for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the lawrenceburg plant the agreement will continue in effect until december 31 2017 unless extended as set forth in the agreement 

ovec 

aep and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each was extended by the owners in 2011 from the termination date of march 2026 until june 2040 aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests ovec’s board of directors has authorized capital expenditures totaling approximately 135 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generating plants ovec has completed the financing of approximately 105 billion for these projects through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances and would expect to finance the remaining cost by issuing additional debt 

  

  

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2 – properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 – utility operations – regulation – rates the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1 – utility operations – regulation – ferc as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 – utility operations – competition 

the use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the aep east companies including wpco and kgpco are subject to the rules protocols and agreements in place with pjm and as approved by the ferc 

transmission coordination agreement oatt and ercot protocols 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to the tca under the tca a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of a overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement including the performance of transmission planning studies b the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and c compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff pursuant to the tca aepsc has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the oatt on behalf of the other parties to the agreement the tca also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the oatt these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp with respect to pso and swepco and puctapproved protocols for ercot with respect to tcc and tnc 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated pursuant to the tca spp oatt and ercot protocols as described above for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

transmission services for nonaffiliates 

in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 – utility operations – electric transmission and distribution – regional transmission organizations below transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

  

  

coordination of east and west zone transmission 

aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the ta and the tca aep’s system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

the aep east companies are members of pjm and swepco and pso are members of the spp both fercapproved rtos rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not the remaining aep west companies tcc and tnc are members of ercot 

regulation 

general 

except for transmission andor retail generation sales in certain of its jurisdictions aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions as well as certain unbundled retail transmission rates mainly in ohio im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact provides the ferc limited “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers securitization formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

  

  

in many jurisdictions the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in the ercot area of texas our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service only in ohio rates for electric service are unbundled for generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2011 annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana 

im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

ohio 

opco provides “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act opco exclusively provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within their service territories at costbased rates approved by the puco transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc 

opco’s generationsupply rates are subject to its esp that the puco approved in march 2009 in december 2011 the puco approved a modified stipulation for a new esp for the period january 2012 through may 2016 that includes a standard service offer sso pricing for generation in february 2012 the puco issued an entry on rehearing which rejected the modified stipulation for a new esp and ordered a return to the 2011 esp rates until a new rate plan is approved 

oklahoma 

pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 

texas 

retail customers in tcc’s and tnc’s ercot service area of texas are served through nonaffiliated retail electric providers reps tcc and tnc provide transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules effective september 2009 competition in the spp area of texas has been delayed until certain steps defined by statute and by puct rule have been accomplished as such the puct continues to approve base and fuel rates for swepco’s texas operations on a cost of service basis 

  

  

virginia 

apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the virginia scc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 

west virginia 

apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which truesup to actual expenses 

  

  

the following table illustrates certain regulatory information with respect to the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

under the fpa the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its balancing area of the spp aep has marketrate authority from the ferc under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals the aep east companies are members of pjm swepco and pso are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc limited “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

competition 

under current ohio legislation electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and our native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service competitive power suppliers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service a growing number of opcos commercial retail customers have switched to alternative generation providers while additional ohio customers have provided notice of their intent to switch currently t here are no limitations on the obligation of opco to provide below cost capacity rate pricing to alternative suppliers to support customers switching in ohio these evolving market conditions will continue to impact opcos results of operations a retail supply subsidiary operates as a competitive retail electric service provider in ohio 

  

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

  

  

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

transmission operations 

whollyowned entities 

aep transco a subsidiary of aep has seven whollyowned transmission companies geographically aligned with our existing operating companies these transmission companies will develop and own new transmission assets that are physically connected to aep’s system the transmission companies have been approved in indiana michigan ohio and oklahoma applications for approval of the transmission companies have been filed with the apsc the kpsc the lpsc the virginia scc and the wvpsc and are pending approval 

aep transco rates have been approved and will be regulated by the ferc and are included in pjm’s and spp’s oatt aepsc and other aep subsidiaries provide services to the transmission companies through service agreements therefore the transmission companies do not have any employees 

all of the transmission companies’ capital needs are provided by parent aep transco andor the aep utility money pool the utility money pool is used to meet the shortterm borrowing needs of aep regulated utility subsidiaries the utility money pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions approved in regulatory orders for the consolidated entities within our transmission operations segment we forecast approximately 350 million excluding afudc of construction expenditures for 2012 

joint venture initiatives 

we have established joint ventures with other incumbent electric utility companies for the purpose of developing building and owning extra high voltage ehv transmission lines to improve reliability and market efficiency and to access remote generation sources in north america our joint ventures are invested in ehv projects at various stages of regulatory and rto approval 

our most significant joint venture electric transmission texas llc ett was established to construct fund own and operate electric transmission assets within ercot including transmission projects in the competitive renewable energy zone crez the puct has awarded approximately 15 billion of total crez investment to ett 

business services for the joint ventures are provided by aepsc and the joint venture partner entity therefore the joint ventures do not have any employees for the equity investments within our transmission operations segment we forecast approximately 116 million of aep equity contributions in 2012 to support construction expenditures and the payment of operating expenses 

  

  

 

aep river operations 

our aep river operations segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants aep river operations includes approximately 2600 barges 45 towboats and 25 harbor boats that we own or lease these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment see item 1 – utility operations – electric generation – fuel supply – coal and lignite 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to   customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather water levels and inefficient older river locks operated by others may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

generation and marketing 

our generation and marketing segment consists of nonutility generating assets and a competitive power supply and energy trading and marketing business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in the ercot market and to a lesser extent ohio in pjm and miso as of december 31 2011 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 mw of companyowned domestic wind power facilities 177 mw of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 377 mw of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers tnc’s interest   in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations in 2010 we started operations of a retail energy business in the state of ohio to sell competitive power supply to residential commercial and industrial customers in the deregulated areas within or near aeps traditional utility service areas

 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

  

the regulatory environment in ohio has recently become unpredictable and increasingly uncertain – affecting aep and opco 

for some time our retail sales of electricity in ohio have accounted for approximately 30 of our utilities segment revenue due to a number of reasons including commission turnover and a renewed emphasis on deregulation the regulatory environment in ohio has become increasingly unpredictable the current regulatory environment in ohio could result in an extended period of uncertainty and cause our financial performance in ohio to be volatile and difficult to project 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions – affecting each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction andor acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

rate and other recovery in ohio for distribution service may not provide full recovery of costs – affecting aep and opco 

in february 2011 opco filed with the puco for an annual increase in distribution rates in december 2011 a stipulation agreement was approved by the puco providing recovery of certain distribution regulatory assets due to a february 2012 puco esp rehearing order which rejected the esp modified stipulation collection of the distribution investment rider terminated if opco is not ultimately permitted to fully recover its deferrals and costs it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

rate recovery in ohio for generation service may not provide full recovery of costs – affecting aep and opco 

in january 2011 opco filed an application with the puco to approve a new esp that included a standard service offer pricing for generation in december 2011 a modified stipulation agreement was approved by the puco which involved various issues pending before the puco including generation rates and the recovery of fuel costs in february 2012 the puco issued an entry on rehearing which rejected the esp approved modified stipulation and ordered a return to the 2011 esp rates until a new rate plan is approved under the february 2012 rehearing order opco has 30 days to notify the puco whether it plans to modify or withdraw its original application as filed in january 2011 management is currently evaluating its options and the potential financial and operational impacts on opco if opco is not ultimately permitted to fully recover its costs it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

rate recovery approved in ohio may have to be returned andor may not provide full recovery of costs – affecting aep and opco 

the puco issued an order in march 2009 that modified and approved the electric security plan esp which established rates through 2011 the esp order generally authorized rate increases during the esp period subject to caps that limit the rate increases and also provides a fuel adjustment clause for the threeyear period of the esp the recovery under the fuel adjustment clause includes deferrals associated with the ormet interim arrangement and is subject to the puco’s ultimate decision regarding the ormet interim arrangement deferrals plus related carrying charges in july 2011 opco filed its 2010 seet filing with the puco if the puco andor the supreme court of ohio reverses all or part of the rate recovery or if deferred fuel costs are not fully recovered for other reasons it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

  

  

  

oklahoma may require us to refund fuel costs that we have collected – affecting pso 

  

in july 2009 the occ initiated a proceeding to review pso’s fuel and purchased power adjustment clause for the calendar year 2008 and also initiated a prudence review of the related costs in march 2010 the oklahoma attorney general and an intervenor recommended the fuel clause adjustment rider be amended to decrease the shareholder’s portion of offsystem sales margins from 25 to 10 that intervenor also recommended that the occ conduct a comprehensive review of all affiliate fuel transactions during 2007 and 2008 in july 2010 additional testimony regarding the 2007 transfer of ercot trading contracts to aep energy partners was filed included in this testimony were unquantified refund recommendations relating to repricing of contract transactions if the occ were to issue an unfavorable decision it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

  

we may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled – affecting each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects is canceled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition if we have recorded any construction work or investments as a regulatory asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements additions and other costs – affecting each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus commissionapproved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered traditionally we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments and improvements while we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow including preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates there can be no assurance that these will be adopted that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner 

 

  

  

 

 

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control – affecting each registrant 

our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities however could negatively impact our revenues operating and capital expenditures and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials we could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk – affecting aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or 89 of the electricity generated by the aep system we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

  

  

  

as a result of the nuclear plant situation in japan following a march 2011 earthquake the nrc has initiated a review of safety procedures and requirements for nuclear generating facilities this review could increase procedures and testing requirements require physical modifications to the plant and increase future operating costs at the cook plant in addition to the review by the nrc congress could consider legislation tightening oversight of nuclear generating facilities we are unable to predict the impact of potential future regulation of nuclear facilities 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect our performance in these regions – affecting each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

  

the amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities is subject to refund – affecting each registrant 

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and miso to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those rtos to mitigate the impact of lost to revenues the ferc approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation seca transition rates beginning in december 2004 and extending through march 2006 because intervenors objected to this decision the seca fees we collected 220 million are subject to refund some claims for refund have been settled and we have recorded a provision for estimated settlement refunds for the remaining unsettled 108 million of gross seca revenues collected any payments in excess of the reserve balance could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards – affecting each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc these standards which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis became mandatory in june 2007 the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity – affecting each registrant 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforeseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power from the market this would increase the pressure on our shortterm debt financing capacity in times of tight liquidity we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers and the time lag between incurring costs and recovery can be long since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage were brief we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations 

  

  

risks related to market economic or financial volatility and other risks 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions – affecting each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our generation transmission and distribution facilities operating these facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on us – affecting each registrant 

we maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business we also hold large amounts of data in various data center facilities which our business depends upon a disruption infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions computer viruses cyber attacks employee theft or misuse power disruptions natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data which in turn could materially adversely affect our business our security procedures such as virus protection software cyber security and our business continuity planning such as our disaster recovery policies and backup systems may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of such events which could adversely impact our operations in addition our business could be adversely affected to the extent we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems as our technology systems become outofdate or obsolete 

if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could have an adverse impact on our net income cash flows and financial condition – affecting each registrant 

we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could have an adverse impact on net income cash flows and financial condition 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses – affecting each registrant 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive in periods of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

  

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt or on the investment grade ratings of aep parent most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

our pension plan could require additional significant contributions – affecting each registrant 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plan the volatility of the capital markets in the past years has affected the market value of these assets also a decline in interest rates on corporate bonds in 2011 has impacted the benchmark discount rate in a way that results in a higher calculated pension liability accordingly our future required contributions to fund obligations under our defined benefit plan could be more than expected 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries – affecting aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep could be subject to regulatory restrictions aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions – affecting each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected 

  

  

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance – affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures as long as current environmental programs remain in effect we have sufficient emission allowances to cover nearly all of our projected needs for the next two years as well as a majority of our needs beyond that timeframe if the federal epa’s replacement rule to reduce interstate transport were to take effect additional costs may be incurred to acquire supplemental allowances for compliance or to achieve further reductions in emissions if and when we obtain additional allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained our risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources our ability to make offsystem sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our offsystem sales prices so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and on occasion we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants the availability of shale natural gas and issues related to its accessibility may have a longterm material effect on the price of natural gas 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the recent past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal emission allowances or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

  

  

risks relating to state restructuring 

we are unable to fully predict the effects of legal separation in ohio and becoming subject to market forces – affecting aep and opco 

in january 2012 the puco approved the corporate separation plan of opco’s generation assets to complete the transition to a fully competitive generation market by june 2015 the corporate separation plan also would require approval by the ferc under provisions of the federal power act in february 2012 as part of the puco’s entry on rehearing which rejected the esp approved modified stipulation the puco revoked its approval of opco’s corporate separation plan also in february 2012 prior to the puco revoking opco’s corporate separation plan an application was filed with the ferc seeking approval among other things to transfer opco’s generation assets to apco kpco and a nonregulated aep subsidiary if we can obtain regulatory approvals our results of operations related to ohio generation would be determined by our ability to sell power at a profit at rates determined by the prevailing market as a result of the february 2012 esp rehearing order we are in the process of withdrawing the puco and ferc applications we intend to file new ferc and puco applications related to corporate separation we can give no assurance that the puco or the ferc will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving our legal separation additionally certain of our generation units may no longer be cost effective and may be retired prior to the end of their anticipated useful life because such generation assets are no longer subject to cost recovery regulation this could result in material impairments 

  

we are unable to predict the consequences of terminating the interconnection agreement and breaking up the aep power pool – affecting aep apco im and opco 

the proposed corporate separation plans of opco’s generation assets will require us to either terminate or substantially alter the interconnection agreement the interconnection agreement establishes the aep power pool which permits aep east companies to share costs and benefits associated with their generating plants on a cost basis it is unknown at this time whether the aep power pool will be replaced by a new agreement among some or all of the members whether individual companies will enter into bilateral or multiparty contracts with each other for power sales and purchases or asset transfers or if each company will choose to operate independently if the aep power pool is terminated without any subsequent agreements between some or all of the parties surplus members will no longer automatically sell to deficit members and they may not be able to otherwise sell that surplus in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the interconnection agreement conversely deficit members will no longer automatically purchase from surplus members and they may not be able to otherwise purchase in amounts or at rates equal to what they obtained under the interconnection agreement the possible loss of these sales by the surplus members and the potential increase in costs for the deficit members could reduce future net income and cash flows we have filed with the ferc seeking approval of the termination of the interconnection agreement the implementation of a power cost sharing agreement between apco im and kpco and to transfer certain generation assets from opco to apco kpco and a nonregulated aep subsidiary as a result of the february 2012 esp rehearing order we are in the process of withdrawing the puco and ferc applications we intend to file new ferc and puco applications related to corporate separation we can give no assurance that the ferc or other state utility commissions will not impose material adverse terms as a condition to approving these arrangements and the termination of the interconnection agreement 

customers are choosing alternative electric generation service providers as allowed by ohio law and regulation – affecting aep and opco 

under current ohio law electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service competitive power suppliers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service a growing number of commercial retail customers have switched to alternative generation providers while additional ohio customers have provided notice of their intent to switch in 2011 we lost approximately 10 of our ohio load due to customer switching currently t here are no limitations on the obligation to provide below cost capacity rate pricing to alternative suppliers to support customers switching in ohio these evolving market conditions will continue to impact our results of operations 

  

  

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps – affecting aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately one hundred reps in 2011 tcc’s largest customer accounted for 22 of its operating revenue and its second largest customer accounted for 12 of its operating revenue tnc’s largest customer a nonutility affiliate accounted for 28 of its operating revenues and its second largest customer accounted for 15 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant – affecting each registrant 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities and could cause us to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will continue to be significant in order to comply with the current and proposed regulations costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our net income and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase if we retire generating plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life there can be no assurance that we will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions either through legislation or by the federal epa could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain – affecting each registrant 

the us congress has not taken any significant steps toward enacting legislation to control co 2 emissions since 2009 in december 2009 the federal epa issued a final endangerment finding under the caa regarding emissions from motor vehicles the federal epa also finalized co 2 emission standards for new motor vehicles and issued a rule that implements a permitting program for new and modified stationary sources of co 2 emissions in a phased manner through 2014 several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding and the federal epa’s subsequent rulemakings the federal epa has announced its intent to propose a co 2 emissions standard for new power generation sources during the next year management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major us industrial enterprises including us and our customers 

if co 2 and other emission standards are imposed the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units while we expect that costs of complying with new co 2 and other ghg emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

  

  

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to pay damages or to limit or reduce our co 2 emissions – affecting each registrant 

there are a number of pending cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which we among others are defendants in general the actions allege that co 2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance due to impacts of global warming and climate change the plaintiffs in these actions seek recovery of damages and other relief if these or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required and we might be required to limit or reduce co 2 emissions such remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers this could have a material impact on our costs in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business in our jurisdictions where generation rates are set on a cost of service basis without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

we may not fully recover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged equipment in cook plant unit 1 and may be required to pay additional accidental outage insurance proceeds to ratepayers – affecting aep and im 

cook plant unit 1 is a 1084 mw nuclear generating unit located in bridgman michigan in september 2008 im shut down cook plant unit 1 unit 1 due to turbine vibrations caused by blade failure which resulted in significant turbine damage and a small fire on the electric generator this equipment located in the turbine building is separate and isolated from the nuclear reactor the turbine rotors that caused the vibration were installed in 2006 and were within the vendor’s warranty period the warranty provides for the repair or replacement of the turbine rotors if the damage was caused by a defect in materials or workmanship repair of the property damage and replacement of the turbine rotors and other equipment cost approximately  400 million management believes that im should recover a significant portion of these costs through the turbine vendor’s warranty insurance and the regulatory process im repaired unit 1 it resumed operations in 2009 at slightly reduced power and a fullcapacity blade was installed in 2011 if the ultimate costs of the incident are not covered by warranty insurance or through the regulatory process or if any future regulatory proceedings are adverse it could have an adverse impact on net income cash flows and financial condition 

 

  

  

 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control – affecting each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities – affecting each registrant 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

  

  

  

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations – affecting each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power – affecting each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities – affecting each registrant 

  

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market 

financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations – affecting each registrant 

in july 2010 federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets that significantly alter how overthecounter otc derivatives are regulated the law increased regulatory oversight of otc energy derivatives including 1 requiring standardized otc derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges regulated by the commodity futures trading commission cftc 2 imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements and 3 authorizing the establishment of overall volume and position limits the law gives the cftc authority to exempt end users of energy commodities which could reduce but not eliminate the applicability of these measures to us and other end users these requirements could cause our otc transactions to be more costly and have an adverse effect on our liquidity due to additional capital requirements in addition as these reforms aim to standardize otc products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor otc derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission lines of ett ohtco and oktco 

 

titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

  

  

 

construction program 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 31 billion of construction expenditures for 2012 excluding equity afudc capitalized interest and assets acquired under leases estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather legal reviews and the ability to access capital 

construction expenditures 

the following table shows construction expenditures including environmental expenditures during 2011 2010 and 2009 and a current estimate of 2012 construction expenditures actual amounts for 2011 2010 and 2009 and budgeted amounts for 2012 exclude equity afudc capitalized interest and assets acquired under leases 

 

the system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand business and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital environmental requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules and costs and in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities as well as variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal income and other taxes and other factors affecting cash requirements may increase or decrease the estimated capital requirements for the system’s construction program 

potential uninsured losses 

some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to our generating plants and costs of replacement power unless allowed to be recovered through rates future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep and other aep system companies for risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

during 2011 management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of american electric power company inc appalachian power company indiana michigan power company ohio power company public service company of oklahoma and southwestern electric power company each a “registrant” and collectively the “registrants” evaluated each respective registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of the registrants that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to each registrant’s management including the principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as of december 31 2011 these officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures in place are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures accomplished their objectives the registrants continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as events warrant 

there have been no changes in the registrants’ internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2011 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the registrants’ internal control over financial reporting 

management is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 as a result of that assessment management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of december 31 2011 and therefore concluded that each registrant’s internal control over financial reporting was effective 

additional information required by this item of the registrants is incorporated by reference to management’s report on internal control over financial reporting included in the 2011 annual report of each registrant

classes of service 

the principal classes of service from which the public utility subsidiaries of aep derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the year ended december 31 2010 are as follows 

 

 

 

  

  

  

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt is also used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand borrowing under aeps revolving credit agreements and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see management’s financial discussion and analysis  included in the 2010 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and our access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and for aep and its significant subsidiaries a 50 million crossacceleration provision at december 31 2010 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s financial discussion and analysis  included in the 2010 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting our power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

the acid rain program the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2 emissions of 89 million tons per year the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2 capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs we continue to meet our obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets subsequent programs developed by federal epa have imposed more stringent so 2 and nox emission reduction requirements than the acid rain program on many of our facilities we have installed additional controls and taken other actions to achieve compliance with these programs 

  

  

  

national ambient air quality standards the caa requires the federal epa to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin federal epa also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25 standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals and a new standard is under development in 2009 the obama administration reconsidered the ozone standard and proposed a more stringent standard which is expected to be finalized in 2011 federal epa has also adopted a new shortterm standard for so 2 a lower standard for no 2  and a lower standard for lead the states will develop new sips for these standards which could result in additional emission reductions being required from our facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair which requires additional reductions in so 2 and no x emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs for additional information regarding cair see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters—clean air act requirements in july 2010 the federal epa issued a proposed rule to replace cair the transport rule that would impose new and more stringent requirements to control so 2 and no x emissions from fossil fuelfired electric generating units in 31 states and the district of columbia for additional information regarding the transport rule see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters—clean air act requirements 

hazardous air pollutants as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2005 the federal epa issued a clean air mercury rule camr setting new source performance standards nsps for mercury emissions from new and modified coalfired power plants and requiring all states to issue new sips including mercury requirements for existing coalfired power plants for additional information regarding camr see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters—clean air act requirements  

regional haze  the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants for additional information regarding cavr see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters—clean air act requirements 

in january 2009 the federal epa issued a determination that 37 states including indiana ohio oklahoma texas and virginia failed to submit sip’s fulfilling the regional haze program requirements by the deadline and commencing a 2year period for the development of a federal implementation plan fip in these states oklahoma subsequently submitted a proposed sip to federal epa but anticipates that federal epa will disapprove the plan and propose a fip in early 2011 we are unable to predict if or how the remand of cair or the development of a fip to satisfy cavr in certain states may affect our compliance obligations for the regional haze programs 

  

  

greenhouse gas emissions  in the absence of comprehensive climate change legislation federal epa has taken action to regulate co 2 emissions under the existing requirements of the caa such actions are being legally challenged by numerous parties for additional information regarding federal epa action taken to regulate co 2 emissions see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters—clean air act requirements 

our fossil fuelfired generating units are large sources of co 2 emissions if substantial co 2 emission reductions are required there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units to the extent we install additional controls on our generating plants to limit co 2 emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase our rates return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings prudently incurred capital investments made by our subsidiaries in rateregulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment we would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements however requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can affect us adversely because our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates to the extent our costs are relatively higher than our competitors’ costs such as operators of nuclear generation it could reduce our offsystem sales or cause us to lose customers in jurisdictions that permit customers to choose their supplier of generation service 

several states have adopted programs that directly regulate co 2 emissions from power plants but none of these programs are currently in effect in states where we have generating facilities certain states including ohio michigan texas and virginia passed legislation establishing renewable energy alternative energy andor energy efficiency requirements we are taking steps to comply with these requirements 

  

 

  

our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in our power plants in 2004 the federal epa issued a final rule requiring all large existing power plants with oncethrough cooling water systems to meet certain standards to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against the plant’s cooling water intake screen or entrained in the cooling water the standards varied based on the water bodies from which the plants draw their cooling water 

in july 2007 the federal epa suspended the 2004 rule except for the requirement that permitting agencies develop best professional judgment bpj controls for existing facility cooling water intake structures that reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact the result is that the bpj control standard for cooling water intake structures in effect prior to the 2004 rule is used as the applicable standard by permitting agencies pending finalization of revised rules by the federal epa 

in april 2009 the us supreme court issued a decision that allows the federal epa the discretion to rely on costbenefit analysis in setting national performance standards and in providing for costbenefit variances from those standards as part of the regulations we cannot predict if or how the federal epa will apply this decision to any revision of the regulations or what effect it may have on similar requirements adopted by the states we expect federal epa to issue revised rules in 2011 

federal epa is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s npdes program these standards were last updated over 20 years ago and epa has issued two rounds of information collection requests to inform its rulemaking in october 2009 federal epa issued a final report for the power plant sector and determined that revisions to its existing standards are necessary but epa has not yet proposed any specific requirements until new standards are proposed we cannot predict the outcome or impact of these rules on our operations 

  

  

  

 

our operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including flyash bottom ash gypsum and other materials in december 2008 the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority’s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties prompting federal and state reviews of ash storage and disposal practices at many coalfired electric generating facilities including ours aep operates 37 ash ponds and we manage these ponds in a manner that complies with state and local requirements including dam safety rules designed to assure the structural integrity of these facilities we also operate a number of dry disposal facilities in accordance with state standards including ground water monitoring and other applicable standards federal epa completed an extensive study of the characteristics of coal ash in 2000 and concluded that combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous waste 

in june 2010 the federal epa published a proposed rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units for additional information regarding federal epa action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on our operations see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters—coal combustion residual rule 

 

position and strategy   we continue to support a federal legislative approach to energy policy as the most effective means of reducing emissions of co 2 and other greenhouse gases generally referred to as co 2  that recognizes that a reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to economic recovery and growth we do not believe regulating co 2 emissions under the clean air act is the appropriate solution during the past decade we have taken voluntary actions to reduce and offset our co 2 emissions unfortunately two of the voluntary programs that helped businesses such as aep to set quantitative commitments no longer exist the us epa’s climate leaders program and the chicago climate exchange both ended their reduction obligations at the end of 2010 however through these programs and others we voluntarily reduced our co 2 emissions by approximately 94 million metric tons during the 2003 to 2009 period we expect our emissions to continue to decline over time as we diversify our generating sources and operate fewer coal units the projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals our strategy for this transformation is to protect the reliability of the electric system and reduce our emissions by pursuing multiple options these include diversifying our fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas supporting incentives to invest in more nuclear generation carbon capture and storage and other advanced coal technologies increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources where there is regulatory support meanwhile the us epa began regulating co 2 emissions from large stationary sources such as power plants in 2011 by issuing a series of rules under the nsr prevention of significant deterioration and title v operating permit programs in the states 

for additional information on legislative and regulatory responses to global warming including limitations on co 2 emissions see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the headings entitled environmental matters – global warming  specific steps taken to reduce co 2 emissions include the following 

carbon capture and storage 

the 20 mw ccs validation project at the mountaineer plant in west virginia successfully captured over 27000 metric tons of co 2 between 2009 and 2010 and stored over 17000 metric tons underground in january 2011 we began preliminary engineering and design work for a second commercialscale coalderived co 2 capture and storage system at the mountaineer plant we are also updating our estimates for the costs related to the commercial scale project we will evaluate the updated estimates before any decision is made to seek the necessary regulatory approvals to build the commercial scale project the project will be partially funded through the us department of energy’s clean coal power initiative aep was awarded federal grant funding of 334 million which represents approximately half the expected cost of this project exclusive of asset retirement obligations 

  

  

  

renewable sources of energy 

some of our states have laws or commission orders that establish requirements or goals for renewable andor alternative energy louisiana ohio arkansas michigan west virginia texas virginia and oklahoma and we are taking steps to comply with these rules in a timely fashion a key sustainability commitment we made is to increase renewable power by an additional 2000 mw from 2007 levels by 2011 subject to regulatory approval by the end of 2010 aep secured through power purchase agreements an additional 1111 mw of renewable power 

end user energy efficiency 

energy efficiency is a high priority for aep because it can be a costeffective way to reduce energy demand and potentially delay the need for new power plants we work collaboratively with regulators technical experts environmental groups and others to develop and implement efficiency and demand response programs from 2008 through 2010 we have achieved approximately 321 mw and 1072000 mwh of demand and energy reductions respectively we have a company 2012 goal to reduce 1000 mw of demand and 2250000 mwh of energy consumption we expect to surpass our energy reduction target subject to regulatory approvals appropriate cost recovery and continued customer demand for programs in 2010 we invested over 70 million throughout most of our service territory in energy efficiency initiatives 

gridsmart   ® 

aep’s gridsmart ® initiative is designed to demonstrate the potential benefits of the smart grid by integrating advanced grid technologies into existing electric networks aep is deploying smart grid technologies in several jurisdictions with regulatory support 

 

 

 

 

current and projected co 2 emissions   our total co 2 emissions in 2009 including our ownership in the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately 136 million metric tons we estimate that our 2010 emissions were approximately 140 million metric tons  emissions in 2011 and beyond will be affected by continued changes in our generation portfolio market prices the pace and scale of the economic recovery in our jurisdictions available capital weather and other factors we expect overall increases in co 2 emissions during the next few years to be small if at all realized as our sales and generation rebound somewhat from recession lows in 2009 however over much of the remainder of the decade we expect emissions to decline as modest sales growth is offset by retirements of older less efficient coalfired units and increased utilization of natural gas 

corporate governance   in response to a shareholder proposal several years ago our board of directors created an ad hoc committee to evaluate our actions to mitigate the economic impact from future policies to reduce co 2 and other emissions our board of directors continually reviews the risks posed by and our actions in response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of our strategic plan the board of directors is frequently informed of any new material environmental issues including changes to regulations and proposed legislation the board’s committee on directors and corporate governance oversees the company’s annual corporate accountability report which includes information on environmental issues environmental planning and policy leadership are criteria incorporated into our executive compensation plan

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2008 2009 and 2010 and the current estimates for 2011 2012 and 2013 are shown below in each case excluding afudc or capitalized interest estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital aep expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2011 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2 becomes regulated while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system see management’s financial discussion and analysis under the heading entitled environmental matters and   note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2010 annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 

  

 

 includes expenditures of the subsidiaries shown and other subsidiaries not shown the figures reflect construction expenditures not investments in subsidiary companies excludes discontinued operations 

 swepco 2010 actual environmental cost includes reclassifications of project costs for suspended capital projects 

  

  

  

electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances a number of studies in the past have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include i the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and ii the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

electric generation 

facilities 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries own or lease approximately 37000 mw of domestic generation see item 2 — properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

aep power pool 

apco cspco im kpco opco and aepsc are parties to the interconnection agreement which was originally approved by the ferc in 1951 and subsequently amended in 1951 1962 1975 1979 twice and 1980 this agreement defines how the member companies share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “member load ratio” the member load ratio is calculated monthly by dividing each company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all member companies the member load ratio multiplied by the aggregate generation capacity of all the member companies determines each member companys capacity obligation the difference between each member companys obligation and its own generation capacity determines the capacity surplus or deficit of each member company the agreement requires the deficit companies to make monthly capacity equalization payments to the surplus companies based on the surplus companies average fixed cost of generation member companies that deliver energy to other member companies to meet their internal load requirements are reimbursed at average variable costs in addition all member companies share offsystem sales margins based upon each member companys member load ratio consequently the agreement provides a strong risk sharing and mitigation arrangement among the member companies as of december 31 2010 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

  

  

  

apco cspco im kpco and opco are parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement which has been approved by the ferc and provides among other things for the transfer of so 2 emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement during the years ended december 31 2008 2009 and 2010 

 

notification of termination of the power pool 

much has changed since the interconnection agreement was originally executed in 1951 these changes include evolving environmental regulations the introduction of “open access” to transmission facilities the implementation of rtos including pjm which is a robust generation power pool that has generating capacity of over 167000 mws movement towards industry deregulation increased competition in wholesale generation markets and the effects of these changes on such things as costs load and the array of supply and demandside resources available to the aepeast operating companies today 

consequently in december 2010 each power pool member gave written notice to the other members and aepsc the pool’s agent of its decision to terminate the interconnection agreement effective january 1 2014 or such other date as approved by ferc subject to state regulatory input this decision to terminate is subject to ongoing evaluation by aep because the interconnection agreement is a rate schedule on file at ferc its termination will not be effective until accepted for filing by ferc the interim allowance agreement would also be terminated on the same date 

by giving notice to terminate the interconnection agreement and the interim allowance agreement the power pool members are providing a timeline within which all power pool members will decide how they will respond to the impacts from modifying or terminating the interconnection agreement the result of this process might be a modified or different type of pool final resolution could involve bilateral contracts or sales of generating assets from surplus members to deficit members if the power pool members do not reach a consensus the power pool members could revoke their notices of termination and the interconnection agreement would remain in place 

csw operating agreement 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to the csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2008 2009 and 2010 

 

  

  

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale see regulation — rates under item 1 utility operations  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading  below  for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east companies pso and swepco this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates and in adjacent regions these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by netting into offsetting contracts   these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2010 counterparties have posted approximately 28 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately 172 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s financial discussion and analysis  included in the 2010 annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk management activities   for additional information 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system 

 

price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in increased use of other fuels variations in the generation of nuclear power are primarily related to a 2008 forced outage caused by a low pressure turbine blade failure event the unit returned to service in december 2009 

 

  

  

management believes that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 8100 railcars 672 barges 17 towboats and a coal handling terminal with 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities see aep river operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep’s utility operations segment 

during 2010 spot market prices for coal generally increased throughout the year among other things these increases are due to higher international demand for us coals and increased mining costs related to regulatory and permitting issues most of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts the price we pay under a number of these contracts is often lower than the spot market price for similar coal as term contracts expire they are replaced with new agreements often at higher prices the price we paid for coal delivered in 2010 decreased from the prior year due in part to the expiration of several high spot market contracts that were entered into in 2007 and 2008 for 2009 and the reopening of some contracts to current market prices 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by aep system companies 

 

 

in cases of emergency or shortage aep has developed programs to conserve coal supplies at its plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with federally approved electric reliability organizations in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

  natural gas  through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed nearly 134 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2010 for generating power this represents a significant increase from 2009 due to lower natural gas prices and the addition of the 508 mw combinedcycle unit at swepco’s j lamar stall facility and the overall increased natural gas demand throughout aep’s system many of the natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of longterm monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate 

 

    n uclear im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel requirements 

  

  

  

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im anticipates that the cook plant has sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations through 2013 im has entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks is tentatively scheduled to begin in 2012 

  

  nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program in 2009 when the most recent study was done the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 831 million to 15 billion in 2009 nondiscounted dollars at december 31 2010 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 12 billion the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies   under the heading nuclear contingencies  included in the 2010 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste  the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available but utah licenses a lowlevel radioactive waste disposal site which currently accepts lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan im ships some of its low level waste to a facility in utah there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to the utah facility im stores the remaining type of lowlevel waste onsite in order to have capacity for the duration of its licensed operation of cook plant for onsite storage of waste not shipped to utah im will have to modify its existing facilities sometime in the next ten to fifteen years 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc called the mone plant opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2012 as extended following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

  

  

  

certain power agreements 

im  the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

cspco  the unit power agreement between aegco and cspco dated march 15 2007 provides for the sale by aegco to cspco of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to aegco at the lawrenceburg plant that are scheduled and dispatched by cspco cspco is obligated to pay a capacity charge whether or not power is available from the lawrenceburg plant and the fuel operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by cspco and to reimburse aegco for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the lawrenceburg plant the agreement will continue in effect until december 31 2017 unless extended as set forth in the agreement 

ovec  aep and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco cspco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each will expire by its terms in march 2026 negotiations are in process among the owners to extend this agreement until 2040 aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests as of december 2010 ovec’s board of directors has authorized capital expenditures totaling approximately 135 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generating plants ovec has completed the financing of approximately 950 million for these projects through debt issuances and would expect to finance the remaining cost by issuing additional debt 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2—properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 –utility operations  regulation—rates  the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1 –utility operations  regulation—ferc  as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

  

  

  

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 –utility operations  competition  

aep transmission pool 

transmission agreement   apco cspco im kpco and opco operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and coordinated system in the aep east transmission zone and are parties to the transmission agreement ta defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the bulk transmission system lines operated at 138kv and above and stations containing extra high voltage equipment the ta has been approved by the ferc sharing under the ta is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies the respective peak demands and memberloadratios as of december 31 2010 are set forth above in the section titled electric generation – aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

in october 2010 the ferc approved our request to amend the ta effective november 1 2010 kgpco and wpco were added as parties to the ta in addition the amendments generally provide for the allocation of pjm transmission costs on the basis of the ta parties’ 12month coincident peak and reimburse transmission revenues based on individual cost of service instead of the memberload ratio method previously used 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the ta during the years ended december 31 2008 2009 and 2010 

 

transmission coordination agreement  oatt and ercot protocols    pso swepco tnc and aepsc are parties to the tca under the tca a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of i overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement including the performance of transmission planning studies ii the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and iii compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff pursuant to the tca aepsc has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the oatt on behalf of the other parties to the agreement the tca also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the oatt these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp with respect to pso and swepco and puctapproved protocols for ercot with respect to tcc and tnc 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated pursuant to the tca spp oatt and ercot protocols as described above during the years ended december 31 2008 2009 and 2010 

 

  

  

transmission services for nonaffiliates   in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 –utility operations – electric transmission and distribution  regional transmission organizations below  transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission   aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the ta and the tca the system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

the aep east companies are members of pjm and swepco and pso are members of the spp both fercapproved rtos rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not the remaining aep west companies tcc and tnc are members of ercot see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2010 annual reports under the heading entitled regional transmission rate proceedings at the ferc for additional information regarding rtos 

regulation 

general 

except for transmission andor retail generation sales in certain of its jurisdictions aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions as well as certain unbundled retail transmission rates mainly in ohio im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact provides the ferc limited “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of i a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and ii such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

  

  

  

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and difficult capital markets we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers securitization formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

in many jurisdictions the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in the ercot area of texas our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service only in ohio rates for electric service are unbundled for generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2010 annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana  im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

ohio  cspco and opco provide “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act cspco and opco exclusively provide distribution and transmission services to retail customers within their service territories at costbased rates approved by the puco transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc cspco and opco’s generationsupply rates are subject to their electric security plans that the puco modified and approved in a march 2009 order the order established standard service offer rates in effect through 2011 the order also provides a fuel adjustment clause for the threeyear period of the esp the order has been appealed by various parties to the supreme court of ohio although the supreme court of ohio has rejected or dismissed a number of procedural and other challenges to the order the order remains on appeal with that court with oral arguments scheduled in february 2011 in january 2011 cspco and opco filed an application with the ferc requesting approval for cspco to merge into opco effective in october 2011 decisions are pending from the puco and the ferc approval of the merger will not affect their rates until such time as the puco approves new rates 

oklahoma  pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 

texas    retail customers in tcc’s and tnc’s ercot service area of texas are served through nonaffiliated retail electric providers “reps” tcc and tnc provide transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules effective september 2009 competition in the spp area of texas has been delayed until certain steps defined by statute and by puct rule have been accomplished as such the puct continues to approve base and fuel rates for swepco’s texas operations on a cost of service basis 

  

  

  

virginia    apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the vscc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc apco is permitted to retain a minimum of 25 of the margins from its offsystem sales with the remaining margins from such sales credited against its fuel adjustment clause factor with a trueup to actual in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 

west virginia  apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy clause which truesup to actual expenses 

other jurisdictions  the public utility subsidiaries of aep also provide service at cost based regulated bundled rates in arkansas kentucky louisiana and tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in michigan these jurisdictions provide for the timely recovery of fuel costs through fuel adjustment clauses that trueup to actual expenses 

  

  

  

the following table illustrates certain regulatory information with respect to the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

ferc 

under the fpa the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by i approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and ii granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its control area of the spp aep has marketrate authority from the ferc under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals the aep east companies are members of pjm swepco and pso are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc limited “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

competition 

under current ohio legislation electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and our native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service competitive power suppliers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service a growing number of cspcos commercial retail customers have switched to alternative generation providers while additional ohio customers have provided notice of their intent to switch in 2010 cspco lost about 3 of its total load due to customer switching these evolving market conditions will continue to impact cspco’s results of operations to date opco’s customer losses have been insignificant in february 2010 the puco granted a retail supply subsidiary of aep a certificate to operate as a competitive retail electric service provider in ohio 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

  

  

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations

our aep river operations segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants we charge affiliated customers rates that reflect our costs aep river operations includes approximately 2581 barges 45 towboats and 26 harbor boats that we own or lease these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment see item 1 – utility operations  electric generation —fuel supply—coal and lignite 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to   customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility information timeliness and equipment the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather and inefficient older river locks operated by others may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

generation and marketing 

our generation and marketing segment consists of nonutility generating assets and a competitive power supply and energy trading and marketing business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in the ercot market and to a lesser extent ohio in pjm and miso as of december 31 2010 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 mw of companyowned domestic wind power facilities  177 mw of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 377 mw of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers tnc’s interest   in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc in 2006 tnc transferred 

  

  

  

its coalfired generation capacity to comply with the separation requirements of the texas act the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations in 2010 we started operations of a retail energy business in the state of ohio the purpose of this operation is to sell competitive power supply to residential commercial and industrial customers in the deregulated areas of ohio 




 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction andor acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

 

swepco is in the process of building the john w turk plant the “turk plant” in southwest arkansas and holds a 73 ownership interest in the planned 600mw coalfired generating facility its construction and anticipated operation has resulted in numerous legal challenges including 

 

 

 

 

 

if swepco is unable to complete the turk plant construction and place the turk plant in service or if swepco cannot recover all of its investment in and expenses related to the turk plant it would materially reduce future net income and cash flows and materially impact financial condition 

  

  

  

our request for rate recovery in ohio for distribution service may not be approved in its entirety   applies to aep cspco and opco 

in january 2011 cspco and opco filed a notice of intent with the puco to file for an annual increase in distribution rates of 34 million and 59 million respectively either as individual companies or if their proposed merger is approved as a single merged entity the increase is based upon an 1115 return on common equity to be effective january 2012 if the puco denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

our request for rate recovery in ohio for generation service may not be approved in its entirety   applies to aep cspco and opco 

in january 2011 cspco and opco filed an application with the puco to approve the new esp that includes a standard service offer pricing for generation effective with the first billing cycle of january 2012 through the last billing cycle of may 2014 the requested increase in 2012 is 54 million and in 2013 is 106 million if the puco denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

ohio may require us to refund revenue that we have collected applies to aep cspco and opco 

ohio law requires that the puco determine on an annual basis if rate adjustments included in prior orders resulted in significantly excessive earnings if the rate adjustments result in significantly excessive earnings the excess amount could be returned to customers in september 2010 cspco and opco filed their 2009 significantly excessive earnings filings with the puco in january 2011 the puco ruled that cspco generated approximately 43 million in significantly excessive earnings during 2009 the ruling is subject to rehearing by the puco and could be appealed in the courts if rehearing or a final appeal if any results in findings of additional significantly excessive earnings then further amounts will be returned to customers cspco and opco must file their 2010 significantly excessive earnings filings with the puco if the puco determines that cspco’s andor opco’s 2010 earnings were significantly excessive cspco andor opco may be required to return a portion of their revenues to customers 

  

ohio may require us to refund fuel costs that we have collected applies to opco 

the puco selected an outside consultant to conduct an audit of recovery under the fuel adjustment clause for the period of january 2009 through december 2009 the audit report included a recommendation that the puco should review whether any proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement which totaled 72 million should reduce opco’s underrecovery balance of the total proceeds approximately 58 million was recognized as a reduction to fuel expense prior to 2009 and 14 million reduced fuel expense in 2009 and 2010 if the puco orders any portion of the 58 million or other future adjustments be used to reduce the current year fuel adjustment clause deferral it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

ohio may require us to refund rider revenue that we have collected applies to cspco and opco 

the puco approved recovery of an economic development rider edr by cspco and opco an intervenor in that proceeding has filed a notice of appeal of that award with the supreme court of ohio as of december 31 2010 cspco and opco have incurred 38 million and 30 million respectively in edr costs including carrying costs if cspco and opco are not ultimately permitted to recover their deferrals it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

  

  

 

in may 2010 apco and wpco filed a request with the wvpsc to increase annual base rates by 156 million based on an 1175 return on common equity to be effective march 2011 if the wvpsc denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

oklahoma may require us to refund fuel costs that we have collected applies to pso 

in july 2009 the occ initiated a proceeding to review pso’s fuel and purchased power adjustment clause for the calendar year 2008 and also initiated a prudence review of the related costs in march 2010 the oklahoma attorney general and an intervenor recommended the fuel clause adjustment rider be amended to decrease the shareholder’s portion of offsystem sales margins from 25 to 10 that intervenor also recommended that the occ conduct a comprehensive review of all affiliate transactions during 2007 and 2008 in july 2010 additional testimony regarding the 2007 transfer of ercot trading contracts to aep energy partners was filed included in this testimony were unquantified refund recommendations relating to repricing of contract transactions if the occ were to issue an unfavorable decision it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition 

our future access to assets used to serve a major customer is in question applies to im 

since 1975 im has leased certain energy delivery assets from the city of fort wayne indiana under a longterm lease that expired on february 28 2010 as a result of a courtsponsored mediation process im agreed to purchase the leased assets from fort wayne the agreement was signed in october 2010 and is subject to approval by the iurc if the iurc does not approve the agreement or the recovery of the costs resulting from the agreement or the lease it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

we may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled applies to each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects is canceled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition if we have recorded any construction work or investments as a regulatory asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements additions and other costs applies to each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus commissionapproved rates may or may not match a utility’s expenses at any given time there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered traditionally we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and difficult capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments and improvements while we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow including preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates there can be no assurance that these will be adopted that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will be done in a timely manner 

  

  

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities however could negatively impact our revenues operating and capital expenditures and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials we could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or 89 of the electricity we generate we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

  

  

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs our ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect our performance in these regions  applies to each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

the amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities is subject to refund  applies to aep apco cspco im and opco 

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and miso to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those rtos to mitigate the impact of lost to revenues the ferc approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation seca transition rates beginning in december 2004 and extending through march 2006 because intervenors objected to this decision the seca fees we collected 220 million are subject to refund some claims for refund have been settled and we have recorded a provision for estimated settlement refunds for the remaining unsettled 108 million of gross seca revenues collected any payments in excess of the reserve balance could harm our results of operations and financial position 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc these standards which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis became mandatory in june 2007 the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity applies to each registrant 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforeseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power from the market this would increase the pressure on our shortterm debt financing capacity in times of tight liquidity we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers and the time lag between incurring costs and recovery can be long since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage were brief we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations 

  

  

  

risks related to market economic or financial volatility 

if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could have an adverse impact on our net income cash flows and financial condition applies to each registrant 

we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could have an adverse impact on net income cash flows and financial condition 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses  applies to each registrant 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive in periods of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

our pension plan will require additional significant contributions applies to each registrant 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plan the volatility of the capital markets in the past years has led to a decline in the market value of these assets also a decline in interest rates on corporate bonds in 2010 has impacted the benchmark discount rate in a way that results in a higher calculated pension liability accordingly our future required contributions to fund obligations under our defined benefit plan could increase significantly 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep could be subject to regulatory restrictions aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations 

  

  

  

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic conditions   applies to each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations   applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance   applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures according to our estimates we have procured sufficient emission allowances to cover nearly all of our projected needs for the next two years as well as a majority of our needs beyond that timeframe at some future point additional costs may be incurred if forthcoming regulation changes require supplemental allowances for compliance if and when we obtain additional allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained 

  

  

  

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources our ability to make offsystem sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our offsystem sales prices so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and on occasion we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the recent past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal emission allowances or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

risks relating to state restructuring 

our customers have recently begun to select alternative electric generation service providers as allowed by ohio legislation applies to aep and cspco 

  

under current ohio legislation electric generation is sold in a competitive market in ohio and our native load customers in ohio have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service competitive power suppliers are targeting retail customers by offering alternative generation service a growing number of cspcos commercial retail customers have switched to alternative generation providers while additional ohio customers have provided notice of their intent to switch in 2010 cspco lost about 3 of its total load due to customer switching to date opco’s losses have not been significant these evolving market conditions will continue to impact cspcos results of operations 

there is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in texas   applies to aep 

restructuring legislation in texas required utilities with stranded costs to use marketbased methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs we elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of tcc’s generation assets for stranded cost purposes in general terms the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount by which the book value of generating assets including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized exceeds the market value of the generation assets as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion we have appealed the puct’s final order seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas restructuring legislation and related rules other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any future court appeals or any future remanded puct proceeding 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps   applies to aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately one hundred reps in 2010 tcc’s largest customer accounted for 25 of its operating revenue and its second largest customer accounted for 13 of its operating revenue tnc’s largest customer a nonutility affiliate accounted for 29 of its operating revenues and its second largest customer accounted for 16 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

  

  

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant   applies to each registrant 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our net income and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions  either through legislation or by the federal epa could materially increase   costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain    applies to each registrant 

in june 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy security act aces aces is a comprehensive energy and global warming bill that includes a number of provisions that would directly affect our business including energy efficiency and renewable electricity standards funding for carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects co 2   emission standards and an economywide cap and trade program for large sources of co 2   emissions that would reduce emissions by 17 in 2020 and just over 80 by 2050 from 2005 levels costs of compliance with the proposed legislation could adversely affect our net income and financial position this legislation did not become law 

separately in december 2009 the federal epa issued a final endangerment finding under the caa regarding emissions from motor vehicles several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding the endangerment finding will lead to regulation of co 2   and other gases under existing laws management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major us industrial enterprises including us and our customers 

if co 2 and other emission standards are imposed the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units while we expect that costs of complying with new co 2 and other ghg emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to limit or reduce our co 2 emissions   applies to each registrant 

in 2004 eight states and the city of new york filed an action in federal district court for the southern district of new york against aep cinergy corp xcel energy southern company and tennessee valley authority the natural resources defense council on behalf of three special interest groups filed a similar complaint against the same defendants the actions allege that co 2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance under federal common law due to impacts of global warming and sought injunctive relief in the form of specific emission reduction commitments from the defendants the second circuit court of appeals reinstated this lawsuit on appeal after the lower court had dismissed it the us supreme court has agreed to hear the defendants’ request for appeal 

  

  

the trial court adjudicating the reinstated nuisance claims may order the defendants including us to limit or reduce co 2 emissions this or similar remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers this could have a material impact on our costs while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

if these or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay penalties andor halt operations moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

we may not fully recover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged equipment in cook plant unit 1 and may be required to pay additional accidental outage insurance proceeds to ratepayers   applies to aep and im 

cook plant unit 1 is a 1084 mw nuclear generating unit located in bridgman michigan in september 2008 im shut down cook plant unit 1 unit 1 due to turbine vibrations caused by blade failure which resulted in significant turbine damage and a small fire on the electric generator this equipment located in the turbine building is separate and isolated from the nuclear reactor the turbine rotors that caused the vibration were installed in 2006 and were within the vendor’s warranty period the warranty provides for the repair or replacement of the turbine rotors if the damage was caused by a defect in materials or workmanship repair of the property damage and replacement of the turbine rotors and other equipment could cost up to approximately  395 million management believes that im should recover a significant portion of these costs through the turbine vendor’s warranty insurance and the regulatory process im repaired unit 1 and it resumed operations in december 2009 at slightly reduced power if the ultimate costs of the incident are not covered by warranty insurance or through the regulatory process or if any future regulatory proceedings are adverse it could have an adverse impact on net income cash flows and financial condition 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control  applies to each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 

  

  

  

volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities applies to each registrant 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements   we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures   these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities   as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio   to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities   these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made   even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our electric generating facilities successfully applies to each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities   operating electric generating facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

a decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations 

  

  

  

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations  applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations   should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses   although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control   if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power  applies to each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale   this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks   if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power   if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited   if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales   although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable   we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities  applies to each registrant 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations   in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts   these activities expose us to risks from price movements   if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices   however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility   to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market 

financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations  applies to each registrant 

in july 2010 federal legislation was enacted to reform financial markets that significantly alter how overthecounter otc derivatives are regulated the law increased regulatory oversight of otc energy derivatives including 1 requiring standardized otc derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges regulated by the commodity futures trading commission cftc 2 imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements and 3 authorizing the establishment of overall volume and position limits the law gives the cftc authority to exempt end users of energy commodities which could reduce but not eliminate the applicability of these measures to us and other end users these requirements could cause our otc transactions to be more costly and have an adverse effect on our liquidity due to additional capital requirements in addition as these reforms aim to standardize otc products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor otc derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to manage

transmission and distribution facilities 

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the aep system and its operating companies and that portion of the total representing 765kv lines 

 

 

 

transmission initiatives 

we continue our pursuit of transmission opportunities throughout the us in 2009 we announced that our recently formed transmission company aep transmission company llc will pursue new transmission investments within our retail service territories through joint ventures with various other companies we have existing andor planned transmission projects and opportunities outside of our retail service territories we plan to invest approximately 273 million in these projects in 2011 see management’s financial discussion and analysis included in the 2010 annual reports under the heading transmission initiatives  for more information 

titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

  

  

  

construction program 

 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 25 billion of construction expenditures for 2011 excluding the debt and equity components of afudc and assets acquired under leases estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital 

construction expenditures 

the following table shows construction expenditures including environmental expenditures during 2008 2009 and 2010 and a current estimate of 2011 construction expenditures actual amounts for 2008 2009 and 2010 exclude the equity component of afudc and assets acquired under leases budgeted amounts for 2011 exclude the debt and equity components of afudc and assets acquired under leases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand business and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital environmental requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules and costs and in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities as well as variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal income and other taxes and other factors affecting cash requirements may increase or decrease the estimated capital requirements for the system’s construction program 

potential uninsured losses 

some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to our generating plants and costs of replacement power unless allowed to be recovered through rates future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep and other aep system companies for risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the aep system are outlined below 

clean air act requirements 

the caa establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions the major caa programs affecting our power plants are described below the states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements 

national ambient air quality standards the caa requires the federal epa to review periodically the available scientific data for six criteria pollutants and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin these concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards naaqs 

each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the naaqs attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas each state must develop a state implementation plan sip to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs and maintain good air quality in attainment areas all sips are submitted to the federal epa for approval if a state fails to develop adequate plans the federal epa develops and implements a plan as the federal epa reviews the naaqs the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new sips in 2008 the federal epa issued revised naaqs for both ozone and fine particulate matter pm 25  the pm 25 standard was remanded by the dc circuit court of appeals but a new standard has not yet been proposed in 2009 the obama administration reconsidered the ozone standard and proposed a more stringent standard federal epa has also proposed a new shortterm standard for so 2 and a new lower standard for no 2  the federal epa also established a lower standard for lead these new standards could result in additional emission reductions being required from our facilities 

in 2005 the federal epa issued the clean air interstate rule cair it requires specific reductions in so 2 and no x emissions from power plants and assists states developing new sips to meet the naaqs cair reduces regional emissions of so 2 and no x which can be transformed into pm and ozone from power plants in the eastern us 28 states and the district of columbia cair requires power plants within these states to reduce emissions of so 2 by 45 by 2010 and by 57 by 2015 from 2003 levels no x emissions were subject to additional limits beginning in 2009 and would be reduced by a total of 61 by 2015 from 2003 levels reduction of both so 2 and no x emissions under cair is to be achieved through a capandtrade program in july 2008 the dc circuit court of appeals remanded cair to the federal epa cair remains in effect while federal epa conducts further rulemaking and we are complying with our obligations under cair we are unable to predict how the federal epa will respond to the remand but we expect a proposal from federal epa in the spring of 2010 a sip that complied with cair also established compliance with other caa requirements including certain visibility goals it is uncertain how federal epa will deal with these requirements on remand the federal epa or states may elect to seek further reductions of so 2 and no x in response to more stringent pm and ozone naaqs or restrict or eliminate the trading programs in the replacement developed for cair 

hazardous air pollutants as a result of the 1990 amendments to the caa the federal epa investigated hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to congress identifying mercury emissions from coalfired power plants as warranting further study in 2005 the federal epa issued a clean air mercury rule camr setting new source performance standards nsps for mercury emissions from new and modified coalfired power plants and requiring all states to issue new sips including mercury requirements for existing coalfired power plants the federal epa issued a model federal rule based on a capandtrade program for mercury emissions from existing coalfired power plants that would reduce mercury emissions to 38 tons per year from all existing plants in 2010 and to 15 tons per year in 2018 

in 2008 the dc circuit court of appeals vacated and remanded camr to the federal epa the federal epa has issued an information collection request to coalfired power plants for emission information on mercury and several additional haps and has announced its intention to issue a proposed rule in 2011 we are unable to predict at this time how the federal epa response to the remand will affect our facilities or their costs of operation but it could be material 

to comply with the remand of cair federal epa may impose no x andor so 2 budgets on a statebystate basis rather than across a multistate region if federal epa takes this approach we would have significantly less flexibility planning for compliance and may have to install additional environmental control equipment on some of our units in addition with the remand of camr federal epa will likely establish maximum achievable control technology mact standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants that could require installation of scrubbers on all coal units regardless of age or size it would be costly and inefficient to retrofit all of our units with such controls and we will urge federal epa to carefully consider all of the options available to it to avoid such a result however we have a number of our older units including some that are already subject to control requirements under the nsr consent decree for which it may be economically inefficient to install scrubbers or other environmental controls including ccs the timing and ultimate disposition of those units will be dictated by environmental regulations the economics of maintaining or retrofitting the units transmission requirements demand for electricity availability and cost of replacement power legislative mandates and capital requirements and regulatory decisions about cost recovery of the remaining investment in retired units in addition if some coal units are prematurely forced to retire we may need to make investments in new transmission lines and substations to create stronger interconnections with neighboring systems 

the acid rain program the 1990 amendments to the caa include a capandtrade emission reduction program for so 2 emissions from power plants by 2000 the program established a nationwide cap on power plant so 2 emissions of 89 million tons per year the 1990 amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce no x emissions through the use of available combustion controls 

the success of the so 2 capandtrade program encouraged the federal epa and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs including cair and camr we continue to meet our obligations under the acid rain program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets cair currently uses the so 2 allowances originally allocated through the acid rain program as the basis for its so 2 capandtrade system we are unable to predict if or how any replacement for cair will utilize the so 2 allowances from the acid rain program 

regional haze  the caa establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit sips that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas regional haze program in 2005 the federal epa issued its clean air visibility rule cavr detailing how the caa’s best available retrofit technology bart requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants the final rule contains a demonstration that cair will result in more visibility improvements than bart for power plants subject to it thus states are allowed to substitute cair requirements in their regional haze program sips for controls that would otherwise be required by bart for barteligible facilities located in states not subject to cair requirements for so 2 and no x oklahoma texas and arkansas of the aep system some additional controls will be required the courts upheld the final rule 

in january 2009 the federal epa issued a determination that 37 states including indiana ohio oklahoma texas and virginia failed to submit sips fulfilling the regional haze program requirements by the deadline and commencing a 2year period for the development of a federal implementation plan fip in these states we are unable to predict if or how the remand of cair or the development of a fip to satisfy cavr in certain states may affect our compliance obligations for the regional haze programs 

 

our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in our power plants in 2004 the federal epa issued a final rule requiring all large existing power plants with oncethrough cooling water systems to meet certain standards to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against the plant’s cooling water intake screen or entrained in the cooling water the standards vary based on the water bodies from which the plants draw their cooling water we expected additional capital and operating expenses which the federal epa estimated could be 193 million for our plants we undertook sitespecific studies and have been evaluating sitespecific compliance or mitigation measures that could significantly change these cost estimates 

in july 2007 the federal epa suspended the 2004 rule except for the requirement that permitting agencies develop best professional judgment bpj controls for existing facility cooling water intake structures that reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact the result is that the bpj control standard for cooling water intake structures in effect prior to the 2004 rule is used as the applicable standard by permitting agencies pending finalization of revised rules by the federal epa 

in april 2009 the us supreme court issued a decision that allows the federal epa the discretion to rely on costbenefit analysis in setting national performance standards and in providing for costbenefit variances from those standards as part of the regulations we cannot predict if or how the federal epa will apply this decision to any revision of the regulations or what effect it may have on similar requirements adopted by the states we expect federal epa to issue revised rules in 2010 

federal epa is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technologybased standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the clean water act’s npdes program these standards were last updated over 20 years ago and epa has issued two rounds of information collection requests to inform its rulemaking in october 2009 federal epa issued a final report for the power plant sector and determined that revisions to its existing standards are necessary but epa has not yet proposed any specific requirements until new standards are proposed we cannot predict the outcome or impact of these rules on our operations 

 

our operations produce a number of different coal combustion products including flyash bottom ash gypsum and other materials in december 2008 the breach of a dike at the tennessee valley authority’s kingston station resulted in a spill of several million cubic yards of ash into a nearby river and onto private properties prompting federal and state reviews of ash storage and disposal practices at many coalfired electric generating facilities including ours aep operates 37 ash ponds and we manage these ponds in a manner that complies with state and local requirements including dam safety rules designed to assure the structural integrity of these facilities we also operate a number of dry disposal facilities in accordance with state standards including ground water monitoring and other applicable standards approximately 40 of aep’s coal combustion products are recycled federal epa completed an extensive study of the characteristics of coal ash in 2000 and concluded that combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous waste however federal epa issued a notice of data availability and request for public comment in 2007 and is expected to propose new management standards for coal ash and related wastes in early 2010 which could require conversion of ash impoundments to dry disposal facilities or impose hazardous waste regulations upon these wastes until these standards are proposed we cannot predict the outcome or impact of these rules on our operations but the costs could be material and could reduce our ability to market combustion wastes for beneficial uses 

 

position and strategy  the topics of whether the earth is warming how much and how fast what role human activity plays and what to do about it are very controversial and actively debated the public policy makers and influencers in washington and in the 11 states we serve have conflicting views we are focused on taking in the short term actions that we see as prudent such as improving energy efficiency investing in developing costeffective and less carbonintensive technologies and evaluating our assets across a range of plausible scenarios and outcomes we are also active participants in a variety of public policy discussions at state and federal levels to assure that proposed new requirements are feasible and the economies of the states we serve are not placed at a competitive disadvantage 

we support a reasonable approach to reduce emissions of co 2 and other greenhouse gases generally referred to throughout as co 2  that recognizes that a reliable and affordable electric supply is vital to economic stability we have taken measurable voluntary actions to reduce and offset our own co 2 emissions we participate in a number of voluntary programs to monitor mitigate and reduce co 2 emissions including the federal epa’s climate leaders program the doe’s co 2 reporting program and the chicago climate exchange we are considering several options that protect the reliability of the electric system while reducing our carbon emissions our strategy is to pursue multiple options including renewable energy energy efficiency new technologies offsets and nuclear generation at the same time we will continue to improve the efficiency of our plants retire or mothball some older inefficient coal units when factors warrant and complete our environmental retrofit program for additional information on legislative and regulatory responses to global warming including limitations on co 2 emissions see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the headings entitled environmental matters – global warming specific steps taken to reduce co 2 emissions include the following 

carbon capture and storage 

we successfully captured transported and stored co 2 emissions from a coalfired power plant in deep geologic formations for the first time in october 2009 for 20 mw of our 1300 mw mountaineer plant in west virginia the next phase of this project – to install the nation’s first commercialscale coalderived co 2 capture and storage system at the mountaineer plant—will be partially funded through the us department of energy’s doe clean coal power initiative aep has been awarded federal grant funding of 334 million which represents approximately half the cost of this phase of the project exclusive of asset retirement obligations the commercialscale phase of aep’s co 2 program will capture approximately 90 of the co 2 from 235 mw of the plant’s 1300 mw of capacity 

renewable sources of energy 

some of our states have passed legislation establishing renewable energy alternative energy andor energy efficiency requirements or goals including ohio texas michigan virginia and west virginia and we are taking steps to comply with these requirements in a timely fashion in order to meet these requirements and as a key part of its corporate sustainability effort aep pledged to increase its renewable power by an additional 2000 mw from its 2007 levels by 2011 subject to regulatory approval by the end of 2009 aep has already secured through power purchase agreements an additional 10135 mw of renewable power aep’s integrated resource plan contains a 10 renewable energy target by 2020 which together with other qualifying alternative energy and energy efficiency measures will exceed the clean energy requirements currently in effect in our states 

limiting emissions through energy efficiency 

energy efficiency is a high priority for us because it is a costeffective way to reduce co 2 emissions and can delay the need to build new power plants we work closely with regulators environmental groups technical experts and others to develop and implement efficiency and demand response programs we have a 2012 goal to reduce 1000 mw of demand and 2250000 mwh of energy consumption through 2009 we have achieved 152 mw and 471000 mwh of demand and energy reduction respectively 

with regulatory support from the puco and partial funding from the doe aep ohio’s gridsmart sm demonstration project will install 110000 advanced electricity meters smart appliances secure integrated smart grid technology and enable plugin hybrid electric vehicles and other consumer systems that will help customers manage electricity use and costs the 150 million project 75 million of which will come from federal stimulus funds is designed to reduce energy consumption by 18000 mwh and peak demand by 15 mw over a three year period – eliminating the equivalent of the energy needed to power 1800 homes to pay for this project the puco approved project trackers in customer rates that allow us to recover costs specific to these programs in a timely manner 

current and projected co 2 emissions our total co 2 emissions in 2008 including our ownership in the kyger creek and clifty creek plants were approximately 155 million metric tons we estimate that our 2009 emissions were approximately 140 million metric tons since 2004 our cumulative co 2 emission reductions were 51 million metric tons by the end of 2008 from adjusted baseline levels in 1998 through 2001 and will be in excess of 70 million tons at the end of 2009 emissions in 2010 and beyond will be affected by continued changes in our generation portfolio market prices the pace and scale of the economic recovery in our jurisdictions available capital weather and other factors we expect overall increases in co 2 emissions during the 20102012 timeframe as our sales and generation rebound somewhat from recession lows in 2009 however over much of the remainder of the decade we expect emissions growth to be relatively flat as increased fossil generation needed to meet modest sales growth is largely offset by retirements of some older coalfired units and increased use of renewable energy particularly from wind 

corporate governance several years ago in response to a shareholder proposal our board of directors created an ad hoc committee to evaluate our actions to mitigate the economic impact from future policies to reduce co 2 and other emissions our board of directors continues to review environmental issues on a regular basis and in connection with its review of our strategic plan the board of directors is also frequently informed of any new material environmental issues including updates on any proposed legislation the board of directors’ committee on directors and corporate governance oversees our sustainability report including the portion of the report that relates to environmental issues environmental planning and policy leadership are criteria incorporated into our executive incentive compensation plan 

other environmental issues and matters 

 

 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2007 2008 and 2009 and the current estimates for 2010 2011 and 2012 are shown below in each case excluding afudc or capitalized interest aep expects to make substantial investments in addition to the amounts set forth below in future years in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2012 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2 becomes regulated while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and   note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2009 annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 

 

 

electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances a number of studies in the past have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 

 

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include i the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and ii the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

electric generation 

facilities 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries own or lease approximately 37000 mw of domestic generation see item 2 — properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

apco cspco im kpco opco and aepsc are parties to the aep interconnection agreement which has been approved by the ferc this agreement defines how the member companies share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “member load ratio” the member load ratio is calculated monthly by dividing each company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all member companies the member load ratio multiplied by the aggregate generation capacity of all the member companies determines each member companys capacity obligation the difference between each member companys obligation and its own generation capacity determines the capacity surplus or deficit of each member company the agreement requires the deficit companies to make monthly capacity equalization payments to the surplus companies based on the surplus companies average fixed cost of generation member companies that deliver energy to other member companies to meet their internal load requirements are reimbursed at average variable costs in addition all member companies share offsystem sales margins based upon each member companys member load ratio consequently the agreement provides a strong risk sharing and mitigation arrangement among the member companies as of december 31 2009 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

apco cspco im kpco and opco are parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement which has been approved by the ferc and provides among other things for the transfer of so 2 emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement during the years ended december 31 2007 2008 and 2009 

 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to a restated and amended operating agreement csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties the separation of the generation business undertaken by tcc and tnc to comply with the texas act has made their business operations incompatible with the csw operating agreement as a result with ferc approval these companies as of may 1 2006 are no longer parties to and no longer supply generating capacity under the csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2007 2008 and 2009 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale see regulation — rates under item 1 utility operations  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading  below  for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east companies pso and swepco this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone because tcc and tnc have exited the generation business these two companies are no longer parties to the system integration agreement 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates and in adjacent regions these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by netting into offsetting contracts   these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2009 counterparties have posted approximately 52 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately 203 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2009 annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk management activities for additional information 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system 

 

price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in increased use of other fuels variations in the generation of nuclear power are primarily related to a 2008 forced outage caused by a low pressure turbine blade failure event refueling and maintenance outages 

  coal and lignite  aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms the economic climate in 2009 exerted downward pressure on electric demand resulting in lower market prices for fuel this lower demand led to a significant decrease in aep’s coal consumption in 2009 as a result of decreased coal consumption and corresponding increases in fuel inventory aep initiated discussions with its coal suppliers in an effort to better match deliveries with consumption and to minimize the impact on fuel inventory costs carrying costs and cash 

 

most of the coal purchased by aep is procured through term contracts generally the prices paid under these term contracts are often lower than spot coal market prices as term contracts expire they are replaced with new agreements often at higher prices the price we paid for coal delivered in 2009 rose from the prior year primarily as a result of this contract replacement process 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by aep system companies 

 

management believes that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 9000 railcars 697 barges 18 towboats and a coal handling terminal with 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities see aep river operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep’s utility operations segment 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries at december 31 2009 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 61 days 

in cases of emergency or shortage aep has developed programs to conserve coal supplies at its plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with federally approved electric reliability organizations in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

natural gas  through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed nearly 96 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2009 for generating power this represents a slight decrease from 2008 due to reduced demand in aep’s western jurisdictions many of the natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of longterm monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as needed 

nuclear im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel requirements 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im anticipates that the cook plant has sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations through 2013 im has entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks is tentatively scheduled to begin in 2012 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program in 2009 when the most recent study was done the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 831 million to 15 billion in 2009 nondiscounted dollars at december 31 2009 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was approximately 11 billion the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies   under the heading nuclear contingencies  included in the 2009 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste  the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available but utah licenses a lowlevel radioactive waste disposal site which currently accepts lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan im ships some of its low level waste to a facility in utah there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to the utah facility im stores the remaining type of lowlevel waste onsite in order to have capacity for the duration of its licensed operation of cook plant for onsite storage of waste not shipped to utah im will have to modify its existing facilities sometime in the next ten to fifteen years 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc called the mone plant opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2012 as extended following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

certain power agreements 

im  the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

cspco  the unit power agreement between aegco and cspco dated march 15 2007 provides for the sale by aegco to cspco of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to aegco at the lawrenceburg plant that are scheduled and dispatched by cspco cspco is obligated to pay a capacity charge whether or not power is available from the lawrenceburg plant and the fuel operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by cspco and to reimburse aegco for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the lawrenceburg plant the agreement will continue in effect until december 31 2017 unless extended as set forth in the agreement 

ovec    aep and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are now entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco cspco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the amended and restated intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each will expire by its terms in march 2026 aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests as of december 2009 ovec’s board of directors has authorized capital expenditures totaling approximately 1 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generating plants ovec’s board of directors has delayed for an indeterminate period final completion of construction at both of the plants if approved and fully funded the estimated total cost to complete the scrubber and landfill projects would be in excess of 13 billion which ovec would expect to finance through issuing debt 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2—properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 –utility operations  regulation—rates  the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1 –utility operations  regulation—ferc  as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 –utility operations  competition  

aep transmission pool 

transmission agreement   apco cspco im kpco and opco operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and coordinated system in the aep east transmission zone and are parties to the transmission agreement ta defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the bulk transmission system lines operated at 138kv and above and stations containing extra high voltage equipment the ta has been approved by the ferc sharing under the ta is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies the respective peak demands and memberloadratios as of december 31 2009 are set forth above in the section titled electric generation – aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

in june 2009 aep filed with ferc to amend the ta in order to add wpco and kgpco and to reallocate pjm costs on an individual basis instead of on a memberloadratio basis in august 2009 ferc accepted the proposed amendment to the ta for filing suspended it for a nominal period to become effective on the first day of the month after a final ferc order in the proceeding as requested subject to refund ferc established a hearing and settlement procedure settlement discussions in the case are currently underway

transmission services for nonaffiliates   in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 –utility operations – electric transmission and distribution  regional transmission organizations below  transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission   aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the ta and the tca the system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

the aep east companies are members of pjm a fercapproved rto swepco and pso are members of the spp another fercapproved rto rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not the remaining aep west companies tcc and tnc are members of ercot see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2009 annual reports under the heading entitled regional transmission rate proceedings at the ferc for additional information regarding rtos 

regulation 

general 

except for transmission andor retail generation sales in certain of its jurisdictions aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions as well as certain unbundled retail transmission rates mainly in ohio im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact provides the ferc limited “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight the law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce co 2 emissions 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of i a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and ii such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and difficult capital markets we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives continue to engage our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers securitization formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

in many jurisdictions the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in the ercot area of texas our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service only in ohio rates for electric service are unbundled for generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2009 annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana  im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

ohio  cspco and opco each operate as a functionally separated utility and provide “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act cspco and opco provide distribution services to retail customers at cost based rates approved by the puco transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc cspco and opco’s generationsupply rates are subject to their electric security plans that the puco modified and approved in a march 2009 order the order established standard service offer rates in effect through 2011 the order also provides a fuel adjustment clause for the threeyear period of the esp the order has been appealed by various parties to the supreme court of ohio although the supreme court of ohio has rejected or dismissed a number of procedural and other challenges to the order the order remains on appeal with that court 

oklahoma  pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are recovered or refunded by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 

texas   tcc has sold all of its generation assets tnc has one active generation unit however all of the output from that unit is sold to a nonutility affiliate pursuant to an agreement effective through 2027 retail customers in tcc’s and tnc’s ercot service area of texas are served through nonaffiliated retail electric providers “reps” tcc and tnc provide transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules effective september 2009 competition in the spp area of texas has been delayed until certain steps defined by statute and by puct rule have been accomplished as such the puct continues to approve base and fuel rates for swepco’s texas operations on a cost of service basis 

virginia   apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates approved by the vscc virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause transmission services are provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc apco is permitted to retain a minimum of 25 of the margins from its offsystem sales with the remaining margins from such sales credited against its fuel adjustment clause factor with a trueup to actual in addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery apco is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses 

west virginia  apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc with rates set on a costofservice basis west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy clause which trues up to actual expenses 

other jurisdictions  the public utility subsidiaries of aep also provide service at cost based regulated bundled rates in arkansas kentucky louisiana and tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in michigan these jurisdictions provide for the timely recovery of fuel costs through fuel adjustment clauses that trueup to actual expenses 

the following table illustrates certain regulatory information with respect to the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ferc 

under the fpa the ferc regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by i approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and ii granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its control area of the spp aep has marketrate authority from the ferc under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals the aep east companies are members of pjm swepco and pso are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc limited “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

competition 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval while competition for retail electric service is required by law in the states of michigan and ohio the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they are unlikely to be materially affected by this competition in an adverse manner 

in ohio cspco has seen an increase in the number of customers and their associated loads switching from cspco to generation service from other providers although as of december 31 2009 the amount switching was less than 1 of cspco’s entire load in february 2010 the puco granted a retail supply subsidiary of aep a certificate to operate as a competitive retail electric service provider in ohio 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

aep river operations 

our aep river operations segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants we charge affiliated customers rates that reflect our costs aep river operations includes approximately 2287 barges 46 towboats and 26 harbor boats that we own or lease these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment see item 1 – utility operations  electric generation —fuel supply—coal and lignite 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to   customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility information timeliness and equipment the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed 

 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

generation and marketing 

 

our generation and marketing segment consists of nonutility generating assets and a competitive power supply and energy trading and marketing business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in the ercot market as of december 31 2009 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 mw of companyowned domestic wind power facilities  177 mw of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements and 377 mw of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers tnc’s interest   in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc tnc transfered its coalfired generation capacity to comply with the separation requirements of the texas act the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction andor acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

our planned capital investment program coincides with a material increase in the price of the fuels used to generate electricity most of our jurisdictions have fuel clauses that permit us to recover these increased fuel costs through rates without a general rate case while prudent capital investment and variable fuel costs each generally warrant recovery in practical terms our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates any such limitation could cause our financial results to be diminished 

turk plant construction and operation permits could be reversed on appeal applies to swepco 

in november 2007 the apsc granted approval for swepco to build the turk plant in arkansas by issuing a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need in june 2009 the arkansas court of appeals issued a unanimous decision that would reverse the apsc’s grant of its permission for construction of the turk plant to serve arkansas retail customers in october 2009 the arkansas supreme court granted the petitions filed by swepco and the apsc to review the arkansas court of appeals decision while the appeal is pending swepco is continuing construction on the plant 

in november 2008 swepco received the required air permit approval for the turk plant from the arkansas department of environmental quality in december 2008 certain opponents filed an appeal of the air permit with the arkansas pollution control and ecology commission the commission upheld the air permit in a january 2010 ruling these same opponents filed a petition with the federal epa to review the air permit in december 2009 the federal epa rejected their petition on every issue except one where the federal epa asked the adeq to supplement the air permit record on one aspect of its best available control technology analysis the turk plant cannot be placed into service without an air permit if swepco is unable to complete the turk plant construction and place the turk plant in service it would reduce net income cash flow and possibly harm our financial condition unless the resultant losses can be fully recovered with a return on unrecovered balances through rates in all of its jurisdictions 

rate recovery approved in ohio may be overturned on appeal may not provide full recovery of fuel costs andor may have to be returned applies to aep opco and cspco 

the puco issued an order in march 2009 that modified and approved the electric security plans “esps” of cspco and opco the esps established rates in effect through 2011 the esp order generally authorized rate increases during the esp period subject to caps that limit the rate increases for cspco to 7 in 2009 6 in 2010 and 6 in 2011 and for opco to 8 in 2009 7 in 2010 and 8 in 2011 the order also provides a fuel adjustment clause “fac” for the threeyear period of the esp the fac increase will be phased in to avoid having the resultant rate increases exceed the ordered annual caps the order allows cspco and opco to defer unrecovered fac costs and to accrue carrying charges on such deferrals at cspco’s and opco’s weighted average cost of capital the deferred fac balance at the end of the threeyear esp period will be recovered through a nonbypassable surcharge over the period 2012 through 2018 although the supreme court of ohio has rejected or dismissed a number of procedural and other challenges to the order the order remains on appeal with that court 

under our esp orders cspco and opco may be required to return recovery awarded if their earnings meet a certain threshold identified by the significantly excessive earnings test seet the puco must determine if rate adjustments included in the esp result in significantly excessive earnings if so the excess amount must be returned to customers the puco’s decision on the seet review of cspco’s and opco’s 2009 earnings is not expected to be finalized until a seet filing is made by cspco and opco in 2010 and the puco issues an order the puco staff recommended that the seet be calculated on an individual company basis and not on a combined cspcoopco basis 

if the puco andor the supreme court of ohio reverses all or part of the rate recovery if deferred fuel costs are not fully recovered for other reasons or if the puco determines cspco’s or opco’s earnings are significantly excessive it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

rate recovery approved in texas may be overturned on appeal applies to aep 

in march 2008 the puct issued an order that increased tcc’s annual pretax income by approximately 50 million various parties appealed the puct decision in february 2009 the texas district court affirmed the puct in most respects in march 2009 various intervenors appealed the texas district court decision to the texas court of appeals management is unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings if the appeals are successful it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

our request for rate recovery in texas may not be approved in its entirety applies to aep and swepco 

in august 2009 swepco filed a base rate case with the puct to increase nonfuel base rates by approximately 75 million annually based on a requested return on common equity of 115 if the puct denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

our request for rate recovery in virginia may not be approved in its entirety applies to aep and apco 

in july 2009 apco filed a base rate case with the virginia scc requesting an increase in the generation and distribution portions of its base rates of 169 million later adjusted to 154 million annually and a 1335 return on equity if the virginia scc denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

our request for rate recovery in kentucky may not be approved in its entirety applies to aep 

in december 2009 kpco filed a base rate case with the kentucky public service commission requesting an increase in its base rates by 124 million annually and a 1175 return on equity if the kentucky public service commission denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

our request for rate recovery in michigan may not be approved in its entirety applies to im 

in january 2010 im filed a base rate case with the michigan public service commission seeking a 63 million increase in revenue based on 1175 return on equity if the michigan public service commission denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

our future access to assets used to serve a major customer is in question applies to im 

since 1975 im has leased certain energy delivery assets from the city of fort wayne indiana under a longterm lease that expires on february 28 2010 im has been negotiating with fort wayne to purchase the remaining assets at the end of the lease but no agreement has been reached fort wayne issued a technical notice of default under the lease to im in august 2009 in october 2009 im filed for declaratory and injunctive relief in indiana state court the court had ordered additional mediation im will seek recovery in rates for any amount it may pay related to this dispute at this time management cannot predict the outcome of this dispute while management believes any triggered costs should be recoverable from customers any unrecovered costs could reduce future net income and cash flows 

oklahoma may require us to refund fuel costs that we have collected applies to pso  

pso underrecovered 42 million of fuel costs resulting from a reallocation of purchased power costs among aep west companies for periods prior to 2002 pso recovered the 42 million by offsetting it against an existing fuel overrecovery during the period june 2007 through may 2008 an association of industrial consumers has contended that pso should not have collected the 42 million without specific occ approval and that the occ should require pso to refund what it collected through its fuel clause the occ has heard the association’s appeal and a decision is pending if the occ were to order pso to refund all or a part of the 42 million it could reduce future net income and cash flows 

we may not recover costs incurred to begin constructing generating plants that are canceled applies to each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new generating units involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other third party suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects is canceled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition if we have recorded any construction work or investments as a regulatory asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements additions and other costs applies to each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered traditionally we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and difficult capital markets have heightened the risks involved in our capital investments and improvements while we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow including preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates there can be no assurance that these will be adopted that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of our costs in a timely manner 

our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities however could negatively impact our revenues operating and capital expenditures and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials we could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or 89 of the electricity we generate we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing market and transmission structures which could affect our performance in these regions  applies to each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

the amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities is subject to refund  applies to aep apco cspco im and opco 

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and miso to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those rtos to mitigate the impact of lost to revenues the ferc approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation seca transition rates beginning in december 2004 and extending through march 2006 because intervenors objected to this decision the seca fees we collected 220 million are subject to refund 

in august 2006 an alj ruled that the seca rates charged were unfair unjust and discriminatory and that new compliance filings and refunds should be made the ferc has not ruled on the matter if the ferc upholds the decision of the alj it would disallow 90 million of the aep east companies’ remaining unsettled 108 million of unsettled gross seca revenues aep has settled 112 million of seca revenues for 10 million we have recorded a provision for estimated settlement refunds any payments in excess of the reserve balance could harm our results of operations and financial position 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc these standards which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis became mandatory in june 2007 the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity applies to each registrant 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforeseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power from the market this would increase the pressure on our shortterm debt financing capacity in times of tight liquidity we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers and the time lag between incurring costs and recovery can be long since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage were brief we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility 

if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could have an adverse impact on our net income cash flows and financial condition applies to each registrant 

we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could have an adverse impact on net income cash flows and financial condition 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses  applies to each registrant 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive in periods of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

our pension plan requires additional significant contributions applies to each registrant 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plan the volatility of the capital markets in recent years has led to a decline in the market value of these assets also a decline in interest rates on corporate bonds in 2009 has impacted the benchmark discount rate in a way that results in a higher calculated pension liability accordingly our future required contributions to fund obligations under our defined benefit plan could increase significantly 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep could be subject to regulatory restrictions aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are effectively subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic conditions   applies to each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions for example offsystem sales volumes decreased by 50 and industrial kwh sales were down 16 in 2009 a period of prolonged diminished economic activity 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations   applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

for example in our continuing environmental investment program we chose to retrofit wet flue gas desulfurization systems on several of our units utilizing the jet bubbling reactor technology these include two coowned units each at the kyger creek and clifty creek plants three coowned units at the cardinal plant and one coowned unit at the conesville plant and in preliminary stages a unit each at our muskingum river and big sandy plants due to unfavorable operating results we completed an extensive review of the design and manufacture of jet bubbling reactor internal components our review concluded that there are fundamental design deficiencies and that inferior andor inappropriate materials were selected for the internal fiberglass components we are negotiating with the original equipment manufacturer to develop a repair or replacement corrective action plan we might incur losses or delays if the original equipment manufacturer does not remediate the deficiencies in a timely manner 

changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance   applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures according to our estimates we have procured sufficient emission allowances to cover nearly all of our projected needs for the next two years as well as a majority of our needs beyond that timeframe at some future point additional costs may be incurred if forthcoming regulation changes require supplemental allowances for compliance if and when we obtain additional allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources our ability to make offsystem sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our offsystem sales prices so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and on occasion we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants 

prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material upward and downward swings in the recent past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal emission allowances or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

risks relating to state restructuring 

there is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in texas   applies to aep 

restructuring legislation in texas required utilities with stranded costs to use marketbased methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs we elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of tcc’s generation assets for stranded cost purposes in general terms the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount by which the book value of generating assets including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized exceeds the market value of the generation assets as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion we have appealed the puct’s final order seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas restructuring legislation and related rules other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any future court appeals or any future remanded puct proceeding 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps   applies to aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately seventy reps in 2009 tcc’s largest customer accounted for 28 of its operating revenue and its second largest customer accounted for 17 of its operating revenue tnc’s largest customer a nonutility affiliate accounted for 30 of its operating revenues and its second largest customer accounted for 18 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant   applies to each registrant 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our net income and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and possibly harm our financial condition 

regulation of co 2 emissions  either through legislation or by the federal epa could materially increase costs to us and our customers or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain applies to each registrant 

in june 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy security act aces aces is a comprehensive energy and global warming bill that includes a number of provisions that would directly affect our business including energy efficiency and renewable electricity standards funding for carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects co 2 emission standards and an economywide cap and trade program for large sources of co 2 emissions that would reduce emissions by 17 in 2020 and just over 80 by 2050 from 2005 levels the senate environment and public works committee passed a bill out of committee in september costs of compliance with the proposed legislation could adversely affect our net income and financial position 

separately in december 2009 the federal epa issued a final endangerment finding under the caa regarding emissions from motor vehicles several groups have filed challenges to the endangerment finding the endangerment finding will lead to regulation of co 2   and other gases under existing laws management believes some policy approaches being discussed would have significant and widespread negative consequences for the national economy and major us industrial enterprises including us and our customers 

if co 2 and other emission standards are imposed the standards could require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would impact the ultimate retirement of older lessefficient coalfired units while we expect that costs of complying with new co 2 and other ghg emission standards will be treated like all other reasonable costs of serving customers and should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims against us may order us to limit or reduce our co 2 emissions   applies to each registrant 

in 2004 eight states and the city of new york filed an action in federal district court for the southern district of new york against aep cinergy corp xcel energy southern company and tennessee valley authority the natural resources defense council on behalf of three special interest groups filed a similar complaint against the same defendants the actions allege that co 2 emissions from the defendants’ power plants constitute a public nuisance under federal common law due to impacts of global warming and sought injunctive relief in the form of specific emission reduction commitments from the defendants the second circuit court of appeals reinstated this lawsuit on appeal after the lower court had dismissed it similarly in october 2009 the fifth circuit court of appeals reversed a decision by the trial court dismissing state common law nuisance claims in a putative class action by mississippi residents asserting that co 2 emissions exacerbated the effects of hurricane katrina 

the trial courts adjudicating these reinstated nuisance claims may order the defendants including us to limit or reduce co 2 emissions this or similar remedies could require us to purchase power from third parties to fulfill our commitments to supply power to our customers this could have a material impact on our costs while management believes such costs should be recoverable from customers as costs of doing business without such recovery those costs could reduce our future net income and cash flows and harm our financial condition 

if these or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay penalties andor halt certain operations moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

we may not fully recover the costs of repairing or replacing damaged equipment in cook plant unit 1   applies to aep and im 

cook plant unit 1 is a 1084 mw nuclear generating unit located in bridgman michigan in september 2008 im shut down unit 1 due to turbine vibrations which resulted in a fire on the electric generator unit 1 resumed operations in december 2009 at reduced power but repair of the property damage and replacement of the turbine rotors and other equipment are estimated to cost approximately 395 million management believes that im should recover a significant portion of these costs through the turbine vendor’s warranty insurance and the regulatory process 

in 2009 im entered into a settlement agreement with intervenors to collect a prior underrecovered fuel balance under the settlement agreement a subdocket was established to consider issues relating to the unit 1 shutdown the use of the accidental outage insurance proceeds and im’s fuel procurement practices management cannot predict the outcome of the subdocket proceeding or future fuel clause proceedings including the treatment of the accidental outage insurance proceeds and whether any fuel clause revenues or insurance proceeds recognized will have to be refunded which could reduce future net income and cash flows 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control  applies to each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 

volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities applies to each registrant 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements   we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures   these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities   as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio   to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities   these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made   even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our pooled electric generating facilities successfully applies to each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities   operating electric generating facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

a decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations  applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations   should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses   although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control   if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power  applies to each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale   this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks   if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power   if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited   if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales   although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable   we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities  applies to each registrant 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations   in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts   these activities expose us to risks from price movements   if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices   however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility   to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market 

proposed financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of our commercial trading operations   applies to each registrant 

in 2009 legislation was introduced in congress to reform financial markets that could significantly alter how overthecounter “otc” derivatives are regulated in december 2009 the us house of representatives adopted legislation that would increase regulatory oversight of otc energy derivatives including 1 requiring standardized otc derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges regulated by the cftc 2 imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements and 3 authorizing the establishment of overall volume and position limits the legislation contains certain exceptions that apply to endusers of energy commodities which could reduce but not eliminate the applicability of these measures to us and other endusers these requirements would cause our otc transactions to be more costly and have an adverse effect on our liquidity due to additional capital requirements in addition as these reforms aim to standardize otc products it could limit the effectiveness of our hedging programs because we would have less ability to tailor otc derivatives to match the precise risk we are seeking to protect

the following table provides operating information relating to the cook plant 

 

 

 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities the ability of im to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured such costs may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the aep system and its operating companies and that portion of the total representing 765kv lines 

 

 

 

titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts approximately 22 billion of construction expenditures excluding afudc for 2010 estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital 

new generation 

aep is in various stages of construction of the following generation facilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turk plant 

swepco is currently constructing the turk plant a new base load 600 mw pulverized coal ultrasupercritical generating unit in arkansas which is expected to be inservice in 2012 swepco owns 73 of the turk plant and will operate the completed facility the turk plant is currently estimated to cost 16 billion excluding afudc with swepco’s share estimated to cost 12 billion excluding afudc several notices of appeal are outstanding at the arkansas supreme court and the puct see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters under the heading turk plant for more information 

transmission initiatives 

we continue our pursuit of transmission opportunities throughout the us in 2009 we announced that our recently formed transmission company aep transmission company llc will pursue new transmission investments within our retail service territories we plan to invest approximately 120 million in these projects in 2010 through joint ventures with various other companies we have existing andor planned transmission projects and opportunities outside of our retail service territories see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations included in the 2009 annual reports under the heading transmission initiatives  for more information

the following table shows construction expenditures including environmental expenditures during 2007 2008 and 2009 and a current estimate of 2010 construction expenditures in each case excluding afudc capitalized interest and assets acquired under leases 

 

 

 

 

 

the system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand business and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital environmental requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules and costs and in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities as well as variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal income and other taxes and other factors affecting cash requirements may increase or decrease the estimated capital requirements for the system’s construction program 

potential uninsured losses 

some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to our generating plants and costs of replacement power unless allowed to be recovered through rates future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep and other aep system companies for risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies under the heading nuclear contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance

 item 9a controls and procedures 

during 2009 management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each of american electric power company inc appalachian power company columbus southern power company indiana michigan power company ohio power company public service company of oklahoma and southwestern electric power company each a “registrant” and collectively the “registrants” evaluated each respective registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures are defined as controls and other procedures of the registrants that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrants in the reports that they file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to each registrant’s management including the principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as of december 31 2009 these officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures in place are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures accomplished their objectives the registrants continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as events warrant 

there have been no changes in the registrants’ internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2009 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting 

management is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 as a result of that assessment management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of december 31 2009 and therefore concluded that each registrant’s internal control over financial reporting was effective

classes of service 

the principal classes of service from which aep and the registrant subsidiaries of aep derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the year ended december 31 2008 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt is also used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand borrowing under aeps revolving credit agreements and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2008 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information concerning shortterm funding and our access to bank lines of credit commercial paper and capital markets 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and a 50 million crossacceleration provision at december 31 2008 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of aep would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2008 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

credit ratings 

the credit ratings of aep and its registrant subsidiaries as of february 18 2009 are set forth below over the first two months of 2009 moody’s placed the senior unsecured debt rating of aep on negative outlook the senior unsecured debt rating of opco swepco tcc and tnc on review for possible downgrade and changed the outlook of apco from negative to stable in february 2008 fitch downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of pso to bbb with stable outlook fitch placed the senior unsecured debt rating of apco and tcc on negative outlook in may 2008 and february 2009 respectively see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2008 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to the credit ratings of the registrants 

 

 sstable outlook nnegative outlook  runder review for possible downgrade 

 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that are potentially material to the aep system include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines injunctive relief and other sanctions see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters  included in the 2008 annual reports   for further information with respect to environmental issues  

while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2008 annual reports for more information regarding environmental matters 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2006 2007 and 2008 and the current estimates for 2009 2010 and 2011 are shown below in each case excluding afudc or capitalized interest aep expects to make substantial investments in addition to the amounts set forth below in future years in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards which have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2010 or have been proposed and may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2 becomes regulated see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and   note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2008 annual reports for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general 

 

 

electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances a number of studies in the past have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include i the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and ii the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

electric generation 

facilities 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries own or lease approximately 37000 mw of domestic generation see item 2 — properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

apco cspco im kpco and opco are parties to the interconnection agreement defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the interconnection agreement has been approved by the ferc the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all aep east companies as of december 31 2008 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

ohio’s electric restructuring law the ohio act was enacted in 2001 to comply with that law cspco and opco functionally separated their generation business from their remaining operations they remained functionally separated through december 31 2008 as authorized by their rate stabilization plans approved by the puco pursuant to rules recently adopted by the puco cspco and opco expect to file corporate separation plans with the puco see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2008 annual reports for more information 

apco cspco im kpco and opco are parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement which provides among other things for the transfer of emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement during the years ended december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 

 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to a restated and amended operating agreement originally dated as of january 1 1997 csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties the separation of the generation business undertaken by tcc and tnc to comply with the texas act has made their business operations incompatible with the csw operating agreement as a result with ferc approval these companies as of may 1 2006 are no longer parties to and no longer supply generating capacity under the csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale in ohio and virginia such rates are based on a statutory formula as ohio considers continuing to transition to the use of market rates for generation and as virginia completes its final year of transition before returning to a form of costbased regulation see regulation — rates under item 1 utility operations  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading  below  for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east companies pso and swepco this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone because tcc and tnc have exited the generation business these two companies are no longer parties to the system integration agreement in an order issued november 26 2008 the ferc ruled that aep should reallocate pretax trading margins from offsystem sales between the aep east companies and the aep west companies during the period from june 2000 to march 2006 governed by the previous system integration agreement see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2008 annual reports under the heading entitled ferc rate matters for additional information 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates and in adjacent regions these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts   these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2008 counterparties have posted approximately 29 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately 100 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market power prices exposures change daily see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2008 annual reports under the heading entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk management activities   for additional information 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system 

 

price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels generally result in increased use of other fuels 

coal and lignite  aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms the price for most solid fuels has been increasing due to increased mining costs including labor diesel fuel mining equipment implementation of new safety regulations and permitting difficulties in addition to higher international demand for eastern us coals to the extent practical management has responded to increases in the price of coal by rebalancing the coal used in its generating facilities with products from different coal regions and sources that have different heat and sulfur contents this rebalancing is an ongoing process that is expected to continue significantly enabled by the installation of scrubbers at a number of our generating facilities management believes that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 9000 railcars 726 barges 18 towboats and a coal handling terminal with 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in our generating facilities see aep river operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep’s utility operations segment 

the price of coal in the various spot markets remains volatile during the first half of 2008 spot market prices for coal generally rose in the second half of 2008 spot market prices for coal generally decreased most of the coal we purchase is procured through longterm contracts the prices we pay under these contracts is usually lower than the spot market price of coal as these longterm contracts expire they are replaced with new agreements often at higher prices the price we paid for coal in 2008 rose from the prior year as a result of this we expect this trend to continue in 2009 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by aep system companies 

 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries at december 31 2008 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 32 days of normal usage this estimate assumes that the total supply would be utilized through the operation of plants that use coal most efficiently 

in cases of emergency or shortage aep has developed programs to conserve coal supplies at its plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with federally approved electric reliability organizations in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

natural gas  through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed nearly 103 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2008 for generating power this represents a slight decrease from 2007 due to reduced demand in aep’s eastern jurisdictions many of the natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of longterm monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant as needed 

n uclear im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel requirements 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im anticipates that the cook plant has sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations through 2013 im has entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks is tentatively scheduled to begin in 2011 which should permit normal operations through 2037 its current licensing period 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program in 2006 when the most recent study was done the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 733 million to 13 billion in 2006 nondiscounted dollars at december 31 2008 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was 959 million the balance of funds available to decommission cook plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements entitled nuclear  included in the 2008 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste  the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available but utah licenses a lowlevel radioactive waste disposal site s which currently accepts lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan im’s access to the barnwell south carolina facility ended in 2008 with some modifications to existing facilities im will have capacity for onsite storage of that waste previously shipped to barnwell south carolina for the duration of its licensed operation of cook plant there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to the utah facility however this facility does not accept all classifications of low level waste 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc and called the mone plant opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2012 as extended following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

certain power agreements 

im  the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

cspco  the unit power agreement between aegco and cspco dated march 15 2007 provides for the sale by aegco to cspco of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to aegco at the lawrenceburg plant that are scheduled and dispatched by cspco cspco is obligated to pay a capacity charge whether or not power is available from the lawrenceburg plant and the fuel operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by cspco and to reimburse aegco for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the lawrenceburg plant the agreement will continue in effect until december 31 2017 unless extended as set forth in the agreement 

ovec    aep and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until september 1 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are now entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco cspco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the amended and restated intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each will expire by its terms on march 12 2026 aep and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests as of december 2008 ovec’s board of directors has authorized capital expenditures totaling 9816 million in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization sulfur dioxide scrubber projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generating plants ovec’s board of directors has delayed for at least eighteen months final completion of construction on one of the plants if approved and fully funded the estimated total cost to complete the scrubber and landfill projects would be in excess of 12 billion which ovec would expect to finance through issuing debt 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2—properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see item 1 –utility operations  regulation—rates  the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1 –utility operations  regulation—ferc  as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 –utility operations  competition  

aep transmission pool 

transmission agreement   apco cspco im kpco and opco operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and coordinated system in aep east transmission zone and are parties to the tea defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the extrahighvoltage transmission system facilities rated 345kv and above and certain facilities operated at lower voltages 138kv up to 345kv the tea has been approved by the ferc sharing under the tea is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies the respective peak demands and memberloadratios as of december 31 2008 are set forth above in the section titled electric generation – aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tea during the years ended december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 

 

transmission coordination agreement   pso swepco tcc tnc and aepsc are parties to the tca which has been approved by the ferc under the tca a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of i overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the aep west companies in the aep west transmission zone including the performance of transmission planning studies ii the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and iii compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff pursuant to the tca the aep west companies have delegated to aepsc responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the aep oatt on their behalf prior to september 2005 the tca also provided for the allocation among the aep west companies of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the aep oatt since then these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp with respect to pso and swepco and puctapproved protocols for ercot with respect to tcc and tnc 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated pursuant to the spp oatt and ercot protocols as described above during the years ended december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 

 

transmission services for nonaffiliates   in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 –utility operations – electric transmission and distribution  regional transmission organizations below  transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission   aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the tea and the tca the system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

the aep east companies are members of pjm a fercapproved rto swepco and pso are members of the spp another fercapproved rto rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not the remaining aep west companies tcc and tnc are members of ercot see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2008 annual reports under the heading entitled regional transmission rate proceedings at the ferc for additional information regarding rtos 

regulation 

general 

except for transmission andor retail generation sales in certain of its jurisdictions aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions see item 1 – utility operations  electric restructuring and customer choice legislation and rates below aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions as well as certain unbundled retail transmission rates mainly in ohio im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact contains key provisions affecting the electric power industry such as giving the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight the law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of i a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and ii such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and difficult capital markets we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow aep representatives are leading the dialogue with our state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process these options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers securitization formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 

in many jurisdictions the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in the ercot area of texas our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service only in ohio rates for electric service are unbundled for generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes while the historical framework remains in a portion of aep’s service territory cspco and opco did not have a fuel adjustment clause to recover increased fuel costs in ohio through 2008 cspco and opco are seeking to implement a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2008 annual reports for more information regarding pending rate matters 

indiana  im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism 

ohio  cspco and opco each operated as a functionally separated utility and provided “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act pursuant to rate stabilization plans approved by the puco cspco and opco provide retail generation service at rates approved by the puco cspco and opco are providing and will continue to provide distribution services to retail customers at cost based rates approved by the puco transmission services will continue to be provided at oatt rates based on rates established by the ferc cspco and opco’s generationsupply rates are no longer cost based regulated pursuant to the ohio amendments cspco and opco have filed their esp with puco each requesting an annual rate increase for 2009 through 2011 that would not exceed approximately 15 per year a significant portion of the requested increases results from the implementation of a fuel cost recovery mechanism that primarily includes fuel costs purchased power costs including mandated renewable energy consumables such as urea other variable production costs and gains and losses on sales of emission allowances cspco and opco have not had a fuel adjustment clause since 1999 

oklahoma  pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above the amount included in base rates are recovered by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established 

texas   tcc has sold all of its generation assets tnc has one active generation unit however all of the output from that unit is sold to a nonutility affiliate pursuant to an agreement effective through 2027 most retail customers in tcc’s and tnc’s ercot service area of texas are served through nonaffiliated retail electric providers “reps” tcc and tnc provide retail transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules in august 2006 the puct delayed competition in the spp area of texas until at least january 1 2011 as such the puct continues to approve base and fuel rates for swepco’s texas operations on a cost of service basis 

virginia   apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates in april 2007 the virginia legislature adopted a comprehensive law providing for the reregulation of electric utilities’ generation and supply rates after the december 31 2008 expiration of capped rates the law provides for among other things biennial rate reviews beginning in 2009 rate adjustment clauses for the recovery of a variety of costs and a minimum allowed return on equity which will be based on the average earned return on equity of regional vertically integrated electric utilities the law also provides that utilities may retain a minimum of 25 of the margins from offsystem sales with the remaining margins from such sales credited against a fuel adjustment clause factor with a trueup to actual 

west virginia  apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy clause which trues up to actual expenses 

other jurisdictions  the public utility subsidiaries of aep also provide service at cost based regulated bundled rates in arkansas kentucky louisiana and tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in michigan these jurisdictions provide for the timely recovery of fuel costs through fuel adjustment clauses that trueup to actual expenses 

the following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ferc 

under the fpa the ferc regulates rates for interstate sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by i approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and ii granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its control area of the spp aep has marketrate authority from the ferc under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an rto file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an rto to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and require utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees 

the ferc oversees the voluntary formation of rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals as a condition of the ferc’s approval in 2000 of aep’s merger with csw aep was required to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities including oasis and tariff responsibilities to one or more rtos as a result the aep east companies are members of pjm swepco and pso are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

electric restructuring and customer choice legislation 

certain states in aep’s service area have adopted restructuring or customer choice legislation in general this legislation provides for a transition from bundled costbased rate regulated electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service and market pricing for the supply of electricity with customer choice of supplier at a minimum this legislation allows retail customers to select alternative generation suppliers electric restructuring andor customer choice began on january 1 2001 in ohio and on january 1 2002 in michigan and the ercot area of texas electric restructuring in the spp area of texas has been delayed by the puct until at least 2011 aep’s public utility subsidiaries operate in both the ercot and spp areas of texas customer choice also began in virginia on january 1 2002 but ended in 2009 for residential customers except those seeking green power pursuant to a new law providing for the reregulation of electric utilities’ generation and supply rates 

ohio restructuring 

currently the ohio act requires vertically integrated electric utility companies that are in the business of providing competitive retail electric service in ohio to separate their generating functions from their transmission and distribution functions following the market development period which ended december 31 2005 retail customers receive distribution and where applicable transmission service from the incumbent utility whose costbased distribution rates are approved by the puco and whose costbased transmission rates are based on rates established by the ferc see item 1 – utility operations  regulation—ferc for a discussion of ferc regulation of transmission rates regulation—rates—ohio and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2008 annual reports  for a discussion of the impact of restructuring on distribution rates the puco has authorized cspco and opco to remain functionally separated 

pursuant to the ohio amendments cspco and opco have filed esp with the puco each requesting an annual rate increase for 2009 through 2011 that would not exceed approximately 15 per year a significant portion of the requested increases results from the implementation of a fuel cost recovery mechanism that primarily includes fuel costs purchased power costs including mandated renewable energy consumables such as urea other variable production costs and gains and losses on sales of emission allowances see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2008 annual reports for more information 

texas restructuring 

the texas act substantially amended the regulatory structure governing electric utilities in texas in order to allow retail electric competition for customers among other things the texas act 

 

 

 

the texas act also provides each affected utility an opportunity to recover its generationrelated regulatory assets and stranded costs resulting from the legal separation of the transmission and distribution utility from the generation facilities and the related introduction of retail electric competition at noncost based rates for generationsupply of electricity regulatory assets consist of the texas jurisdictional amount of generationrelated regulatory assets and liabilities in the audited financial statements as of december 31 1998 stranded costs consist of the excess of the net regulated book value of generation assets as of december 31 2001 over the market value of those assets taking specified factors into account as ultimately determined in a puct trueup proceeding 

tcc elected to sell its generating facilities to establish its recoverable stranded costs in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application or trueup proceeding with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large tcc has appealed seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas act and related rules tcc intends to appeal any final adverse rulings regarding the puct’s order in the trueup proceedings 

after puct approval in october 2006 tcc issued 174 billion of securitization bonds including additional issuance and carrying costs through the date of issuance for a discussion of i regulatory assets and stranded costs subject to recovery by tcc and ii rate adjustments made after implementation of restructuring to allow recovery of certain costs by or with respect to tcc and tnc see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2008 annual reports  

michigan customer choice 

customer choice commenced for im’s michigan customers on january 1 2002 in october 2008 the governor of michigan signed legislation to limit customer choice load to no more than 10 of the annual retail load for the preceding calendar year rates for retail electric service for im’s michigan customers were unbundled though they continue to be cost based regulated to allow customers the ability to evaluate the cost of generation service for comparison with other suppliers at december 31 2008 none of im’s michigan customers have elected to change suppliers and no alternative electric suppliers are registered to compete in im’s michigan service territory 

virginia reregulation 

in april 2007 the virginia legislature adopted a comprehensive law providing for the reregulation of electric utilities’ generation and supply rates after the december 31 2008 expiration of adjusted capped rates the law provides for among other things biennial rate reviews beginning in 2009 rate adjustment clauses for the recovery of a variety of costs and a minimum allowed return on equity which will be based on the average earned return on equity of regional vertically integrated electric utilities the law also provides that utilities may retain a minimum of 25 of the margins from offsystem sales with the remaining margins from such sales credited against apco’s fuel adjustment clause factor with a trueup to actual 

competition 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they are unlikely to be materially affected by this competition in an adverse manner 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

aep river operations 

our aep river operations segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we permit aep utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that reflect our cost our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants we charge affiliated customers rates that reflect our costs aep river operations includes approximately 2252 barges 42 towboats and 22 harbor boats that we own or lease these assets are separate from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior segment see item 1 – utility operations  electric generation —fuel supply—coal and lignite 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to   customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility information timeliness and equipment the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed 

 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

 

generation and marketing 

 

our generation and marketing segment consists of nonutility generating assets and a competitive power supply and energy trading and marketing business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in the ercot market as of december 31 2008 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 mw of companyowned domestic wind power facilities  75mw of domestic wind power from a longterm purchase power agreement and 377 mw of coalfired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers tnc’s interest   in the oklaunion power station to aep energy partners inc during first quarter of 2009 one of our nonutility affiliates aep energy partners inc entered into a purchase power agreement effective through 2029 that entitles us to the output of a wind farm of approximately 100mw capacity tnc’s transfer of coalfired generation capacity is in order to comply with the separation requirements of the texas act the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ercot we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations 

 

other 

plaquemine cogeneration facility 

pursuant to an agreement with dow aep constructed an 880 mw cogeneration facility “facility” at dow’s chemical facility in plaquemine louisiana that achieved commercial operation status in 2004 dow used a portion of the energy produced by the facility and sold the excess power to us we agreed to sell up to all of the excess 800 mw to tractebel litigation in connection with that power agreement was settled in august 2005 for more information see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies  in november 2006 we sold our interest in the facility to dow negotiations for the sale resulted in an aftertax impairment of approximately 136 million see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations and impairments  

for information regarding other noncore investments see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations and impairments  included in the 2008 annual reports 




 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions   applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction andor acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

our planned capital investment program coincides with a material increase in the price of the fuels used to generate electricity most of our jurisdictions have fuel clauses that permit us to recover these increased fuel costs through rates without a general rate case while prudent capital investment and variable fuel costs each generally warrant recovery in practical terms our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates any such limitation could cause our financial results to be diminished 

while indiana permits the recovery of prudently incurred costs our request for rate recovery may not be approved in its entirety   applies to aep and im 

in january 2008 im filed a request to increase base rates in its indiana jurisdiction by approximately 80 million the request included a return on equity of 115 and the ability to introduce additional riders the requested increase is attributable to additional costs relating to operating in the pjm reliability enhancement demand side management additional offsystem sales margin sharing and environmental compliance costs while regulation in indiana provides for a return on costs prudently incurred there can be no assurance that the iurc will approve all of the costs included in our filing or that this process will result in rates providing full recovery in a timely manner if the iurc denies the requested rate recovery it could adversely impact future results of operations cash flows and financial conditions 

our request for rate recovery in ohio may not be approved   in its entirety  applies to aep opco and cspco 

in july 2008 within the parameters of the esp cspco and opco filed with the puco to establish rates for 2009 through 2011 cspco and opco each requested an annual rate increase for 2009 through 2011 that would not exceed approximately 15 per year a significant portion of the requested increases results from the implementation of a fuel cost recovery mechanism that primarily includes fuel costs purchased power costs including renewable energy consumables such as urea other variable production costs and gains and losses on sales of emission allowances management expects a puco decision on the esp filings in the first quarter of 2009 cspco and opco have requested retroactive application of the new rates back to january 1 2009 upon approval if the puco denies all or part of the requested rate recovery it could have an adverse effect on future net income cash flows and financial condition 

we may not recover costs incurred to begin construct ing generating plants that are canceled   applies to each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new generating units involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects is canceled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition if we have recorded any construction work or investments as a regulatory asset we may need to impair that asset in the event the project is canceled 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of capital improvements  additions and other costs   applies to each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered traditionally we have financed capital investments and improvements until the new asset was placed in service provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment the asset was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and difficult capital markets has heightened the risks involved in our capital investments and improvements while we are actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow including preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers securitization formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates there can be no assurance that these will be adopted that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of our costs in a timely manner 

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

our operations are structured to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and we take measures to minimize the risk of significant disruptions material disruptions at one or more of our operational facilities however could negatively impact our revenues operating and capital expenditures and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials we could experience unexpected but significant interruption due to several events including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2191 mw or 89 of the electricity we generate we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing transmission regulatory structures which could affect our performance in these regions  applies to each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

the amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities has been reduced and is subject to refund    applies to aep apco cspco im and opco 

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and miso to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those rtos the elimination of the to rates reduced the transmission service revenues collected by the rtos and thereby reduced the revenues received by transmission owners under the rtos’ revenue distribution protocols to mitigate the impact of lost to revenues the ferc approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation seca transition rates beginning in december 2004 and extending through march 2006 because intervenors objected to this decision the seca fees we collected 220 million are subject to refund 

a hearing was held in may 2006 to determine whether any of the seca revenues should be refunded in august 2006 the alj ruled that the rate design for the recovery of seca charges was flawed and that a large portion was not recoverable the alj found that the seca rates charged were unfair unjust and discriminatory and that new compliance filings and refunds should be made the alj also found that unpaid seca rates must be paid in the recommended reduced amount the ferc has not ruled on the matter if the ferc upholds the decision of the alj it would disallow 90 million of the aep east companies’ remaining unsettled 108 million of unsettled gross seca revenues aep has settled 112 million of seca revenues for 10 million we have recorded a provision for estimated settlement refunds after completed and inprocess settlements the aep east companies have a remaining reserve balance of 34 million to settle the remaining 108 million in unsettled gross seca revenues based on this settlement history the 34 million reserve balance should be adequate to absorb the potential refund of the remaining contested seca rates assuming that the claims are settled payments in excess of the reserve balance could harm our results of operations and financial position 

an increase in the amount pjm charges us for transmitting power over its network may not be fully recoverable  applies to aep and im 

on june 1 2007 in response to a 2006 ferc order pjm revised its methodology for calculating the effect of transmission line losses in generation dispatch when determining locational marginal prices the new method is designed to recognize the varying delivery costs of transmitting electricity from individual generator locations to the places where customers consume the energy due to the implementation of the new methodology we experienced an increase in the cost of transmitting energy to customer load zones in the pjm aep has initiated discussions with pjm regarding the impact of the new methodology and will pursue a modification through the appropriate stakeholder processes management believes these additional costs should be recoverable through retail andor costbased wholesale rates recovery has been authorized by the puco kpsc vscc and wvpsc the adjudication of the filing with the iurc is pending in the interim such costs in these jurisdictions will have an adverse effect on future results of operations and cash flows management is unable to predict whether full recovery will ultimately be approved 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc these standards which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis became mandatory in june 2007 the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity   applies to each registrant 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforeseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power from the market this would increase the pressure on our shortterm debt financing capacity in times of tight liquidity we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers and the time lag between incurring costs and recovery can be long since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage were brief we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility 

if we are unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms it could have an adverse impact on our net income cash flows and financial condition applies to each registrant 

we rely on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows the recent volatility and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect our ability to raise capital and fund our capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness in addition if capital is available only on less than reasonable terms or to borrowers whose creditworthiness is better than ours capital costs could increase materially restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could have an adverse impact on net income cash flows and financial condition 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses  applies to each registrant 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive in the current period of market turmoil access to capital is difficult for all borrowers if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our costs of capital will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

if moody’s or sp were to downgrade the longterm rating of any of the securities of the registrants  particularly below investment grade the borrowing costs of that registrant would increase which would diminish its financial results in addition the registrant’s potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease over the first two months of 2009 moody’s placed the senior unsecured debt rating of aep on negative outlook the senior unsecured debt rating of opco swepco tcc and tnc on review for possible downgrade and changed the outlook of apco from negative to stable in february 2008 fitch downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of pso to bbb with stable outlook fitch placed the senior unsecured debt rating of apco and tcc on negative outlook in may 2008 and february 2009 respectively 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

our retirement plans may require additional significant contributions applies to each registrant 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plans the recent deterioration of the capital markets has led to a decline in the market value of these assets and a reduction in the benchmark discount rate with respect to a return on these assets accordingly we expect that our future funding requirements of the obligations under our defined benefit plans to significantly increase 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep would be subject to regulatory or contractual restrictions aep indebtedness and common stock dividends are effectively subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness and preferred stock obligations 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis   and with general economic conditions   applies to each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable further deteriorating economic conditions generally result in reduced consumption by our customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate on the basis of prevailing economic conditions for example a leading customer of apco century aluminum in west virginia announced in february 2009 that it was ceasing operations 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

 

certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations  applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices and the costs of transport may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance   applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal and the price and availability to transport coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures according to our estimates we have procured sufficient emission allowances to cover our projected needs for the next two years and for much of the projected needs for periods beyond that at some point however we may have to obtain additional allowances and those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources our ability to make offsystem sales at a profit is highly dependent on the price of natural gas as the price of natural gas falls other market participants that utilize natural gasfired generation will be able to offer electricity at increasingly competitive prices relative to our offsystem sales prices so the margins we realize from sales will be lower and on occasion we may need to curtail operation of marginal plants 

the price trends for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material increases in the recent past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal emission allowances or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

in ohio we have limited ability to pass on our fuel costs to our customers  applies to aep cspco and opco 

because generation is no longer regulated in ohio we are exposed to risk from changes in the market prices of coal natural gas and emissions allowances used to generate power the prices of coal natural gas and emissions allowances have increased materially in the recent past the protection afforded by retail fuel clause recovery mechanisms has been eliminated by the implementation of customer choice in ohio which represents approximately 20 of our fuel costs as long as generating costs cannot be passed through to customers as a matter of right in ohio we retain these risks if we cannot recover an amount sufficient to cover our actual fuel costs our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

risks relating to state restructuring 

there is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in texas  applies to aep 

restructuring legislation in texas required utilities with stranded costs to use marketbased methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs we elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of tcc’s generation assets for stranded cost purposes in general terms the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount by which the book value of generating assets including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized exceeds the market value of the generation assets as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion we have appealed the puct’s final order seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas restructuring legislation and related rules other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any future court appeals or any future remanded puct proceeding 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps   applies to aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately seventy reps in 2008 tcc’s largest customer accounted for 28 of its operating revenues tnc’s largest customer a nonutility affiliate accounted for 28 of its operating revenues and its second largest customer accounted for 12 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could harm our cash flow and profitability or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to maintain or operate applies to each registrant 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety approximately 90 of the electricity generated by the aep system is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future further environmental advocacy groups other organizations and some agencies in the united states are focusing considerable attention on co 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change although several bills have been introduced in congress that would compel co 2 emission reductions none have advanced through the legislature in april 2007 the us supreme court determined that co 2 is an “air pollutant” and that the federal epa has authority to regulate co 2 emissions under the caa in july 2008 the federal epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr that requests comments on a wide variety of issues in response to the us supreme court’s decision the anpr could lead to regulations limiting the emissions of co 2 from our generating plants in addition the obama administration has indicated that it intends to focus on reducing co 2   emissions 

costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our net income and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase all of our estimates are subject to significant uncertainties about the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables including timing of implementation required levels of reductions allocation requirements of the new rules and our selected compliance alternatives as a result we cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty the actual costs to comply could differ significantly from our estimates all of the costs are incremental to our current investment base and operating cost structure in addition any legal obligation that would require us to substantially reduce our emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and in the case of co 2 legislation would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels particularly coal as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices without such recovery those costs could adversely affect future net income and cash flows and possibly financial condition 

governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations   applies to each registrant  

if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations even if caused by factors beyond our control that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us in july 2004 attorneys general of eight states and others sued aep and other utilities alleging that co 2 emissions from power generating facilities constitute a public nuisance under federal common law the trial court dismissed the suits and plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal while we believe the claims are without merit the costs associated with reducing co 2 emissions could harm our business and our results of operations and financial position 

if these or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay penalties andor halt operations moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

our financial performance may be impaired if cook plant unit 1 is not returned to service in a reasonable period of time or in a costefficient manner applies to aep and im 

cook plant unit 1 is a 1055 mw nuclear generating unit located in bridgman michigan in september 2008 im shut down unit 1 due to turbine vibrations likely caused by blade failure which resulted in a fire on the electric generator im is working with its insurance company and turbine vendor to evaluate the extent of the damage resulting from the incident and the costs to return the unit to service repair and replacement of the turbine rotors is estimated to cost up to approximately 330 million management believes that im should recover a significant portion of these costs through the turbine vendor’s warranty insurance and the regulatory process if any of these costs are not covered by warranty insurance or recovered through the regulatory process or if the unit is not returned to service in a reasonable period of time it could have an adverse impact on net income cash flows and financial condition 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control  applies to each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market or other competitive power markets or on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions the rate of return on our capital investments is not determined through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 

volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our power trading including coal gas and e mission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities applies to each registrant 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our pooled electric generating facilities successfully  applies to each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities operating electric generating facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

a decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations  applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power  applies to each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities  applies to each registrant 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market

the following table provides operating information relating to the cook plant 

 

 

 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities the ability of im to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured such costs may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the aep system and its operating companies and that portion of the total representing 765kv lines 

 

 

 

titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations included in the 2008 annual reports for more information on current siting proceedings

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that are potentially material to the aep system include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines injunctive relief and other sanctions see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters  included in the 2007 annual reports   for further information with respect to environmental issues  

while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices in ohio and texas without such recovery those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system in october 2007 we settled the new source review litigation with the epa the united states department of justice various states and special interest groups the litigation challenged whether modifications to or maintenance of certain coalfired generating plants required additional permitting or pollution control technology in settling we agreed to invest in additional environmental controls for our plants before 2019 we also paid a 15 million civil penalty and will provide 36 million for environmental projects coordinated with the federal government and 24 million to the states for environmental mitigation see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2007 annual reports for more information regarding the settled litigation and other environmental matters

electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances a number of studies in the past several years have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to a restated and amended operating agreement originally dated as of january 1 1997 csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties the separation of the generation business undertaken by tcc and tnc to comply with the texas act has made their business operations incompatible with the csw operating agreement as a result with ferc approval these companies are no longer parties to and no longer supply generating capacity under the csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2005 2006 and 2007 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale in ohio and virginia such rates are based on a statutory formula as ohio considers continuing to transition to the use of market rates for generation and as virginia completes it final year of transition before returning to a form of costbased regulation see regulation — rates under item 1 utility operations  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading  below  for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement which has been approved by the ferc provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east companies pso and swepco this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone because tcc and tnc have exited the generation business these two companies are no longer parties to the system integration agreement 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts   these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2007 counterparties and exchanges have posted approximately 43 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately 77 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on market power prices exposures change daily 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of fuel used by the aep system 

 

variations in the generation of nuclear power are primarily related to refueling and maintenance outages price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels generally result in increased use of other fuels 

coal and lignite  aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms the price for most solid fuels generally has been increasing management has responded to increases in the price of coal by rebalancing the coal used in its generating facilities with coal from different coal regions and sources that have different heat and sulfur contents this rebalancing is an ongoing process that is expected to continue significantly enabled by the installation of scrubbers at a number of our generating facilities management believes that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns leases or controls more than 8400 railcars 692 barges 16 towboats and a coal handling terminal with 20 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in its generating facilities see memco operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep’s utility operations segment 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by system companies 

 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries at december 31 2007 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 29  33 days of normal usage this estimate assumes that the total supply would be utilized through the operation of plants that use coal most efficiently 

in cases of emergency or shortage system companies have developed programs to conserve coal supplies at their plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with officials of federal and state agencies and in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

natural gas  through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed over 108 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2007 for generating power a portfolio of longterm monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant 

nuclear   im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets im also leases nuclear fuel 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im anticipates that the cook plant has sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations through 2013 im has entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program in 2006 when the most recent study was done the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranged from 733 million to 13 billion in 2006 nondiscounted dollars at december 31 2007 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was 1057 billion the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections we will seek recovery from customers through our regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our projections see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements entitled nuclear  included in the 2007 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste  the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available but south carolina and utah license lowlevel radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan im’s access to the barnwell south carolina facility is currently allowed through the end of fiscal year 2008 with some modifications to existing facilities im will have capacity for onsite storage of that waste currently shipped to barnwell south carolina for the duration of its licensed operation of cook plant there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to the utah facility however this facility does not accept all classifications of low level waste 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc and called the mone plant opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2012 as extended following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

certain power agreements 

im  the unit power agreement between aegco and im dated march 31 1982 provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im the agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts that im would have paid aegco under the terms of the unit power agreement between aegco and im for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

cspco  the unit power agreement between aegco and cspco dated march 15 2007 provides for the sale by aegco to cspco of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to aegco at the lawrenceburg plant that are scheduled and dispatched by cspco cspco is obligated to pay a capacity charge whether or not power is available from the lawrenceburg plant the fuel operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by cspco and to reimburse aegco for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the lawrenceburg plant the agreement will continue in effect until december 31 2017 unless extended as set forth in the agreement 

ovec   aep and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until september 1 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are now entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco cspco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the amended and restated intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each will expire by its terms on march 12 2026 aep and the other owners have been evaluating the need for environmental investments related to their ownership interests which are material in december 2006 ovec’s board of directors authorized interim capital expenditures totaling 366 million in order to complete detailed engineering and began construction of flue gas desulfurization sulfur dioxide scrubber projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills in november 2007 ovec’s board of directors authorized additional interim capital expenditures of up to 828 million for completion of the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills if approved the estimated total cost to complete the scrubber and landfill projects would be in excess of 1 billion which ovec would expect to finance through issuing debt 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2—properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates established and approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see regulation—rates  the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1 –utility operations  regulation—ferc  as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1 –utility operations  competition  

aep transmission pool 

transmission equalization agreement   apco cspco im kpco and opco operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and coordinated system and are parties to the tea defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the extrahighvoltage transmission system facilities rated 345kv and above and certain facilities operated at lower voltages 138kv up to 345kv the tea has been approved by the ferc sharing under the tea is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies the respective peak demands and memberloadratios as of december 31 2007 are set forth above in the section titled electric generation – aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tea during the years ended december 31 2005 2006 and 2007 

 

transmission coordination agreement   pso swepco tcc tnc and aepsc are parties to the tca which has been approved by the ferc under the tca a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of i overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the aep west companies including the performance of transmission planning studies ii the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and iii compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff pursuant to the tca the aep west companies have delegated to aepsc responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the aep oatt on their behalf prior to september 2005 the tca also provided for the allocation among the aep west companies of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the aep oatt since then these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp with respect to pso and swepco and puctapproved protocols for ercot with respect to tcc and tnc 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tca prior to september 2005 and pursuant to the spp oatt and ercot protocols as described above during the years ended december 31 2005 2006 and 2007 

 

transmission services for nonaffiliates   in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1 –utility operations  regional transmission organizations below  transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission   aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the tea and the tca the system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

the aep east companies are members of pjm a fercapproved rto swepco and pso are members of the spp another fercapproved rto rtos operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not the remaining aep west companies tcc and tnc are members of ercot see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2007 annual reports under the heading entitled rto formationintegration costs and transmission rate proceedings at the ferc for a discussion of public utility subsidiary participation in rtos 

regulation 

general 

except for transmission andor retail generation sales in certain of its jurisdictions aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional regulation by the state utility commissions see item 1 – utility operations  electric restructuring and customer choice legislation and rates below aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact contains key provisions affecting the electric power industry such as giving the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight the law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of i a utility’s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and ii such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

in many jurisdictions the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in the ercot area of texas our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service in ohio rates for electric service are unbundled for generation transmission and distribution service historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes while the historical framework remains in a portion of aep’s service territory recovery of increased fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause is no longer provided for in ohio 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction 

indiana  im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc with rates set on a costofservice basis in january 2008 im filed for an increase in its indiana base rates of 82 million based on a return on equity of 115 and a september 30 2007 test year the base rate increase includes a 69 million reduction in depreciation the filing requests trackers for certain variable components of the cost of service including additional pjm costs reliability enhancement costs demand side managementenergy efficiency costs offsystem sales margins and net environmental compliance costs the trackers would increase annual revenues by 46 million im proposes to share 50 of an estimated 96 million of offsystem sales margins with ratepayers with a guaranteed minimum of 20 million a decision is expected from the iurc in early 2009 

ohio  cspco and opco each operated as a functionally separated utility and provided “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act through december 31 2007 the puco approved the rate stabilization plans filed by cspco and opco which among other things address default retail generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 retail generation rates are determined consistent with the rate stabilization plan until december 31 2008 cspco and opco are providing and will continue to provide distribution services to retail customers at rates approved by the puco these rates are frozen from their levels as of december 31 2005 through december 31 2008 transmission services will continue to be provided at rates based on rates established by the ferc cspco and opco have been involved in discussions with various stakeholders in ohio about pending legislation to address the period following the expiration of the rate stabilization plans see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2007 annual reports for more information 

oklahoma  pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above the amount included in base rates are recovered by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year following when new annual factors are established in november 2006 pso filed a request with the occ seeking an increase in base rates and other rate relief and the occ issued a final order in october 2007 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2007 annual reports for additional information 

texas   tcc has sold all of its generation assets tnc has one active generation unit however all of the output from that unit is sold to a nonutility affiliate pursuant to a 20year agreement most retail customers in tcc’s and tnc’s ercot service area of texas are served through nonaffiliated retail electric providers “reps” tcc and tnc provide retail transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules in november 2006 tcc and tnc filed requests with the puct seeking increases in the rates charged to reps for delivering electricity over their transmission and distribution lines the puct granted increases during 2007 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2007 annual reports for additional information in august 2006 the puct delayed competition in the spp area of texas until at least january 1 2011 as such the puct continues to approve base and fuel rates for swepco’s texas operations 

virginia   apco currently provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates in april 2007 the virginia legislature adopted a comprehensive law providing for the reregulation of electric utilities’ generation and supply rates after the december 31 2008 expiration of capped rates the law provides for among other things biennial rate reviews beginning in 2009 rate adjustment clauses for the recovery of a variety of costs and a minimum allowed return on equity which will be based on the average earned return on equity of regional vertically integrated electric utilities the law also provides that utilities may retain a minimum of 25 of the margins from offsystem sales with the remaining margins from such sales credited against fuel factor expenses with a trueup to actual 

in may 2007 the vscc approved an overall annual increase in base rates in december 2007 the vscc approved recovery of certain recurring environmental and reliability costs the first of several anticipated requests for costs expected to be incurred in february 2008 the vscc approved an adjustment in apco’s fuel factor and the submission of pjmrelated costs in fuel factor review and recovery and authorized apco to retain a share of margins from its offsystem sales for a more complete discussion of these matters see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2007 annual reports 

west virginia  apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs in june 2007 the wvpsc approved a settlement agreement that provided for recovery of additional costs effective july 1 2007 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2007 annual reports for additional information on current rate proceedings 

other jurisdictions  the public utility subsidiaries of aep also provide service at regulated bundled rates in arkansas kentucky louisiana and tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in michigan 

the following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ferc 

under the fpa the ferc regulates rates for interstate sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects the ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates the ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers the ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by i approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and ii granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its control area of the spp aep has marketrate authority from the ferc under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place the ferc requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the ferc also requires all transmitting utilities to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and require utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ system operators from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s merchant energy employees utilities are permitted to seek recovery of certain prudently incurred stranded costs that result from unbundled transmission services 

the ferc oversees the voluntary formation of rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals as a condition of the ferc’s approval in 2000 of aep’s merger with csw aep was required to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to one or more rtos the aep east companies are members of pjm swepco and pso are members of spp 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both the ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

electric restructuring and customer choice legislation 

certain states in aep’s service area have adopted restructuring or customer choice legislation in general this legislation provides for a transition from bundled costbased rate regulated electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service and market pricing for the supply of electricity with customer choice of supplier at a minimum this legislation allows retail customers to select alternative generation suppliers electric restructuring andor customer choice began on january 1 2001 in ohio and on january 1 2002 in michigan and the ercot area of texas electric restructuring in the spp area of texas has been delayed by the puct until at least 2011 aep’s public utility subsidiaries operate in both the ercot and spp areas of texas customer choice also began in virginia on january 1 2002 but will end beginning in 2009 pursuant to the passage of legislation providing for the reregulation of electric utilities’ generation and supply rates 

ohio restructuring 

currently the ohio act requires vertically integrated electric utility companies that are in the business of providing competitive retail electric service in ohio to separate their generating functions from their transmission and distribution functions following the market development period which ended december 31 2005 retail customers receive distribution and where applicable transmission service from the incumbent utility whose distribution rates are approved by the puco and whose transmission rates are based on rates established by the ferc the puco approved cspco’s and opco’s rsps that among other things addressed default generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 see item 1 – utility operations  regulation—ferc for a discussion of ferc regulation of transmission rates regulation—rates—ohio and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2007 annual reports  for a discussion of the impact of restructuring on distribution rates the puco authorized cspco and opco to remain functionally separated through 2008 

the ohio act requires cspco and opco to begin implementing marketbased rates on january 1 2009 following the expiration of their rsps however in august 2007 legislation was introduced that would significantly reduce the likelihood of cspco’s and opco’s ability to charge marketbased rates for generation at the expiration of their rsps the legislation has been passed by the ohio senate and is being considered by the ohio house of representatives aep management is working closely with various stakeholders to achieve a principled fair and wellconsidered approach to electric supply pricing 

texas restructuring 

signed into law in june of 1999 the texas act substantially amended the regulatory structure governing electric utilities in texas in order to allow retail electric competition for customers among other things the texas act 

 

 

 

the texas act provides each affected utility an opportunity to recover its generationrelated regulatory assets and stranded costs resulting from the legal separation of the transmission and distribution utility from the generation facilities and the related introduction of retail electric competition regulatory assets consist of the texas jurisdictional amount of generationrelated regulatory assets and liabilities in the audited financial statements as of december 31 1998 stranded costs consist of the positive excess of the net regulated book value of generation assets as of december 31 2001 over the market value of those assets taking specified factors into account as ultimately determined in a puct trueup proceeding 

in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application or trueup proceeding with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large tcc has appealed seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas act and related rules tcc intends to appeal any final adverse rulings regarding the puct’s order in the trueup proceedings 

after puct approval in october 2006 tcc issued 174 billion of securitization bonds including additional issuance and carrying costs through the date of issuance the puct authorized negative competition transition charges in the amount of 356 million in october 2006 tcc is required to refund this amount to its ratepayers for a discussion of i regulatory assets and stranded costs subject to recovery by tcc and ii rate adjustments made after implementation of restructuring to allow recovery of certain costs by or with respect to tcc and tnc see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2007 annual reports  

michigan customer choice 

customer choice commenced for im’s michigan customers on january 1 2002 rates for retail electric service for im’s michigan customers were unbundled though they continue to be regulated to allow customers the ability to evaluate the cost of generation service for comparison with other suppliers at december 31 2007 none of im’s michigan customers have elected to change suppliers and no alternative electric suppliers are registered to compete in im’s michigan service territory 

virginia reregulation 

in april 2007 the virginia legislature adopted a comprehensive law providing for the reregulation of electric utilities’ generation and supply rates after the december 31 2008 expiration of capped rates the law provides for among other things biennial rate reviews beginning in 2009 rate adjustment clauses for the recovery of a variety of costs and a minimum allowed return on equity which will be based on the average earned return on equity of regional vertically integrated electric utilities the law also provides that utilities may retain a minimum of 25 of the margins from offsystem sales with the remaining margins from such sales credited against fuel factor expenses with a trueup to actual 

competition 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with and approved by the various state commissions occasionally these rates are negotiated with the customer and then filed with the state commissions for approval the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they are unlikely to be materially affected by this competition in an adverse manner 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

memco operations 

our memco operations segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we have also served aep utility subsidiary affiliates our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants we charged affiliated customers rates that reflected our costs the memco operations include approximately 1992 barges 38 towboats and 14 harbor boats that we own or lease 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to   customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility information timeliness and equipment the industry continues to experience consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed 

 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

 

generation and marketing 

 

our generation and marketing segment consists of nonutility generating assets and a competitive power supply and energy trading business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in the ercot market the assets utilized in this segment include approximately 310 mw of domestic wind power facilities and 377 mw of coalfired capacity obtained from tnc’s interest in the oklaunion power station tnc has entered into a 20year power agreement transferring this generating capacity to a nonutility affiliate that we operate in order to comply with the separation requirements of the texas act the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is to be marketed and sold in ercot we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations 

 

other 

gas operations 

in january 2005 we sold a 98 controlling interest in hpl and related assets with the remaining 2 interest being sold to the buyer in november 2005 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments and assets held for sale  included in the 2007 annual reports for more information as a result management anticipates that our gas marketing operations will be limited to managing our obligations with respect to the gas transactions entered into before these sales 

plaquemine cogeneration facility 

pursuant to an agreement with dow aep constructed an 880 mw cogeneration facility “facility” at dow’s chemical facility in plaquemine louisiana that achieved commercial operation status in 2004 dow used a portion of the energy produced by the facility and sold the excess power to us we agreed to sell up to all of the excess 800 mw to tractebel litigation in connection with that power agreement has been settled for more information see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies  in november 2006 we sold our interest in the facility to dow negotiations for the sale resulted in an aftertax impairment of approximately 136 million see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments and assets held for sale 

for information regarding other noncore investments see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments and assets held for sale included in the 2007 annual reports 




 item 1a risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions   applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction andor acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

our planned capital investment program coincides with a material increase in the price of the fuels used to generate electricity many of our jurisdictions have fuel clauses that permit us to recover these increased fuel costs through rates without a general rate case while prudent capital investment and variable fuel costs each generally warrant recovery in practical terms our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates any such limitation could cause our financial results to be diminished 

while indiana permits the recovery of prudently incurred costs our request for rate recovery may not be approved applies to aep and im 

in january 2008 im filed a request to increase base rates in its indiana jurisdiction by approximately 82 million the request included a return on equity of 115 and the ability to introduce additional riders the requested increase is attributable to additional costs relating to operating in the pjm reliability enhancement demand side management additional offsystem sales margin sharing and environmental compliance costs while regulation in indiana provides for a return on costs prudently incurred there can be no assurance that the iurc will approve all of the costs included in our filing or that this process will result in rates providing full recovery in a timely manner if the iurc denies the requested rate recovery it could adversely impact future results of operations cash flows and financial conditions 

the internal allocation of aep system offsystem sales margins has been challenged applies to apco cspco im and opco 

offsystem sales margins are allocated among the aep system companies pursuant to a fercapproved agreement among those companies entered into at the time of the merger with csw in november 2005 we filed with the ferc a proposed allocation methodology to be used in 2006 and beyond the original allocations have been challenged in different forums including a pso fuel clause recovery proceeding before the occ in general the challenges assert that aep west companies acquired in the merger with csw are being allocated a disproportionately small amount of the offsystem sales margins the occ and separately a federal district court in texas have each held that the ferc is the only appropriate adjudicator of such challenges this holding has been affirmed by a federal appellate court no proceeding questioning the allocation of our offsystem sales is currently before the ferc if the ferc were to retroactively allocate additional offsystem sales margins to the aep west companies the aep east companies may be required to pay money to the aep west companies any such payments could have an adverse effect on the results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition of the aep east companies 

we may not recover costs incurred to construct generating plants that are canceled   applies to each registrant 

our business plan for the construction of new generating units involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs to limit the risks of these construction projects we enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits if any of these projects are cancelled for any reason including our failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits we could incur significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts in addition we may need to impair any construction workin process assets for any expenses we have incurred 

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

unless mitigated by timely and adequate regulatory recovery the cost of repairing damage to our utility facilities due to storms natural disasters wars terrorist acts and other catastrophic events in excess of insurance coverage when applicable may adversely impact our revenues operating and capital expenses and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2143 mw or 6 of our generation capacity we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing transmission regulatory structures which could affect our performance in these regions  applies to each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets the rules governing the various regional power markets including spp and pjm may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because the manner in which rtos will evolve remains unclear we are unable to assess fully the impact that changes in these power markets may have on our business 

the amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities has been reduced and is subject to refund    applies to aep apco cspco im and opco 

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and miso to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those rtos the elimination of the to rates reduced the transmission service revenues collected by the rtos and thereby reduced the revenues received by transmission owners under the rtos’ revenue distribution protocols to mitigate the impact of lost to revenues the ferc approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation seca transition rates beginning in december 2004 and extending through march 2006 because intervenors objected to this decision the seca fees we collected 220 million are subject to refund 

a hearing was held in may 2006 to determine whether any of the seca revenues should be refunded in august 2006 the alj ruled that the rate design for the recovery of seca charges was flawed and that a large portion was not recoverable the alj found that the seca rates charged were unfair unjust and discriminatory and that new compliance filings and refunds should be made the alj also found that unpaid seca rates must be paid in the recommended reduced amount the ferc has not ruled on the matter if the ferc upholds the decision of the alj it would disallow 90 million of the aep east companies’ remaining 115 million of unsettled gross seca revenues we have recorded provisions in the aggregate amount of 37 million related to the potential refund of seca rates after completed and inprocess settlements the aep east companies will have a remaining reserve balance of 35 million to settle the remaining unsettled gross seca revenues 

an increase in the amount pjm charges us for transmitting power over its network may not be fully recoverable  applies to aep and im 

on june 1 2007 in response to a 2006 ferc order pjm revised its methodology for calculating the effect of transmission line losses in generation dispatch when determining locational marginal prices the new method is designed to recognize the varying delivery costs of transmitting electricity from individual generator locations to the places where customers consume the energy due to the implementation of the new methodology we experienced an increase in the cost of transmitting energy to customer load zones in the pjm aep has initiated discussions with pjm regarding the impact of the new methodology and will pursue a modification through the appropriate stakeholder processes management believes these additional costs should be recoverable through retail andor costbased wholesale rates recovery has been authorized by the puco and vscc the filing with the iurc is pending and filings in other affected jurisdictions are planned in the interim such costs in these jurisdictions will have an adverse effect on future results of operations and cash flows management is unable to predict whether full recovery will ultimately be approved 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards applies to each registrant 

as a result of epact owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the north american electric reliability corporation and enforced by the ferc these standards which previously were being applied on a voluntary basis became mandatory in june 2007 the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with new reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures while we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner if we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of costs   applies to each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered while rate regulation is premised on providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of our costs in a timely manner 

we operate in a nonuniform and fluid regulatory environment  applies to each registrant 

in addition to the multiple levels of state regulation at the states in which we operate our business is subject to extensive federal regulation developments in federal legislative and regulatory initiatives which have occurred over the past few years and which have generally facilitated competition in the energy sector andor 2 state regulation could cause the regulatory environment to become significantly more restrictive further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate will impact the effectiveness of our business plan and may because of the continued uncertainty harm our financial condition and results of operations 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity   applies to each registrant 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforeseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power from the market we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage were brief we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses  applies to each registrant 

since the bankruptcy of enron the credit ratings agencies have periodically reviewed our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

if moody’s or sp were to downgrade the longterm rating of any of the securities of the registrants  particularly below investment grade the borrowing costs of that registrant would increase which would diminish its financial results in addition the registrant’s potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease in february 2008 fitch downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of pso to bbb with stable outlook moody’s placed the senior unsecured debt rating of apco opco swepco and tcc on negative outlook in january 2008 moody’s assigns the following ratings to the senior unsecured debt of these companies apco baa2 opco a3 swepco baa1 and tcc baa2 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep would be subject to regulatory or contractual restrictions 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis   applies to each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations  applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance   applies to each registrant 

we are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures according to our estimates we have procured sufficient emission allowances to cover our projected needs for the next two years and for much of the projected needs for periods beyond that at some point however we may have to obtain additional allowances and those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources 

the price trends for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material increases in the recent past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal emission allowances or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

in ohio we have limited ability to pass on our fuel costs to our customers  applies to aep cspco and opco 

because generation is no longer regulated in ohio we are exposed to risk from changes in the market prices of coal natural gas and emissions allowances used to generate power the prices of coal natural gas and emissions allowances have increased materially in the recent past the protection afforded by retail fuel clause recovery mechanisms has been eliminated by the implementation of customer choice in ohio which represents approximately 20 of our fuel costs as long as generating costs cannot be passed through to customers as a matter of right in ohio we retain these risks if we cannot recover an amount sufficient to cover our actual fuel costs our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

downgrades in the credit ratings of companies insuring certain of our financings could cause our costs of borrowing to increase for the foreseeable future applies to each registrant 

a significant amount of our financings involve the periodic resetting of the interest rates applicable in those financings pursuant to auctions among investors “auction rate bonds” in order to attract additional investors to these auctions we often procure financial guaranty policies that insure our obligation to pay interest and principal on our auction rate bonds credit downgrades and financial difficulties of certain providers of financial guaranty policies have significantly reduced investor willingness to place bids on auction rate bonds these events have caused the interest rates on auction rate bonds to increase thereby increasing our cost of capital and diminishing our earnings while we may seek to limit the impact of these increased costs by attempting to refinance our auction rate bonds there can be no assurance as to our ability to do so at attractive rates 

risks relating to state restructuring 

in ohio our future rates are uncertain applies to aep opco and cspco 

cspco and opco are involved in discussions with various stakeholders in ohio about potential legislation to address the period following the expiration of the rsps on december 31 2008 in august 2007 legislation was introduced that would significantly reduce the likelihood of cspco’s and opco’s ability to charge marketbased rates for generation at the expiration of their rsps the legislation has been passed by the ohio senate and still must be considered by the ohio house of representatives at this time management is unable to predict whether cspco and opco will transition to market pricing extend their rsp rates with or without modification or become subject to a legislative reinstatement of some form of costbased regulation for their generation supply business on january 1 2009 a return to costbased rates for generation supply in ohio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition future results of operations and cash flows further the return of costbased regulation could cause the generation business of cspco and opco to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting principles results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if and when cspco and opco are required to reestablish certain net regulatory liabilities applicable to their generation supply business 

there is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in texas  applies to aep 

restructuring legislation in texas required utilities with stranded costs to use marketbased methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs we elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of tcc’s generation assets for stranded cost purposes in general terms the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount by which the book value of generating assets including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized exceeds the market value of the generation assets as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion we have appealed the puct’s final order seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas restructuring legislation and related rules other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any future court appeals or any future remanded puct proceeding 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps   applies to aep 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately seventy reps in 2007 tcc’s largest customer accounted for 23 of its operating revenues tnc’s largest customer a nonutility affiliate accounted for 35 of its operating revenues and its second largest customer accounted for 15 of its operating revenues adverse economic conditions structural problems in the texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could harm our cash flow and profitability or cause some of our electric generating units to be uneconomical to maintain or operate  applies to each registrant  

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future further environmental advocacy groups other organizations and some agencies in the united states are focusing considerable attention on co 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change although several bills have been introduced in congress that would compel co 2 emission reductions none have advanced through the legislature on april 2 2007 the us supreme court issued a decision holding that the federal epa has authority to regulate emissions of co 2 and other greenhouse gases under the caa costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase all of our estimates are subject to significant uncertainties about the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables including timing of implementation required levels of reductions allocation requirements of the new rules and our selected compliance alternatives as a result we cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty the actual costs to comply could differ significantly from our estimates all of the costs are incremental to our current investment base and operating cost structure in addition any legal obligation that would require us to substantially reduce our emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and in the case of co 2 legislation would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels particularly coal as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities while we expect to recover our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices in ohio and texas without such recovery those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition 

governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations   applies to each registrant  

if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations even if caused by factors beyond our control that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us in july 2004 attorneys general of eight states and others sued aep and other utilities alleging that co 2 emissions from power generating facilities constitute a public nuisance under federal common law the trial court dismissed the suits and plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal while we believe the claims are without merit the costs associated with reducing co 2 emissions could harm our business and our results of operations and financial position 

if these or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay penalties andor halt operations moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control  applies to each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market or other competitive power markets or on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions we are generally not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition the ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or the ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 

volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our power trading including coal gas and e mission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities applies to each registrant 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our pooled electric generating facilities successfully  applies to each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities operating electric generating facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

a decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations  applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power  applies to each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities  applies to each registrant 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market

cook nuclear plant 

the following table provides operating information relating to the cook plant 

 

 

costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities however the ability of im to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured such costs may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs

transmission and distribution facilities 

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the aep system and its operating companies and that portion of the total representing 765kv lines 

 

 

 

titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations included in the 2007 annual reports for more information on current siting proceedings 

construction program 

general 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts 38 billion 37 billion and 36 billion of construction expenditures excluding afudc for 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital

classes of service 

the principal classes of service from which the public utility subsidiaries of aep derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the year ended december 31 2006 are as follows 

 

 

 

epact and the repeal of puhca 

epact was signed into law on august 8 2005 among other things epact repealed puhca effective february 8 2006 puhca regulated many significant aspects of a registered holding company system such as the aep system puhca limited the operations of a registered holding company system to a single integrated public utility system and such other businesses as were incidental or necessary to the operations of the system puhca also required that transactions between associated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at cost with limited exceptions as a result of puhca’s repeal utility holding companies including the aep system are no longer limited to a single integrated public utility system further utility holding companies are no longer restricted from acquiring businesses that may not be related to the utility business jurisdiction over certain holding company related activities has been transferred to the ferc including the issuances of securities by public utilities the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both ferc and state regulators will be permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

epact contains key provisions affecting the electric power industry these provisions include tax changes for the utility industry incentives for emissions reductions and federal insurance and incentives to build new nuclear power plants it gives the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight the law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases ferc has issued regulations implementing epact we do not expect compliance with these regulations to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt is also used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and a 50 million crossacceleration provision at december 31 2006 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2006 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities 

credit ratings 

in september 2005 moody’s upgraded aep’s senior unsecured rating to baa2 from baa3 and its commercial paper rating to prime2 from prime3 there were no changes in the ratings or rating outlook for aep or aep’s rated subsidiaries by moody’s since that time sp did not change the ratings of aep or its rated subsidiaries during 2006 it did improve our business risk profile rating from six to five fitch placed tnc on negative outlook in april 2006 but has made no other changes to the ratings of aep or its rated subsidiaries during 2006 

see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2006 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to the credit ratings of the registrants other than aegco 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that are potentially material to the aep system include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines injunctive relief and other sanctions see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters  included in the 2006 annual reports   for further information with respect to environmental issues  

if our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices in deregulated jurisdictions those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition 

the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system 

see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2006 annual reports for further information with respect to environmental matters 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2004 2005 and 2006 and the current estimates for 2007 2008 and 2009 are shown below in each case excluding afudc or capitalized interest substantial investments in addition to the amounts set forth below are expected by the system in future years in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls in order to comply with air and water quality standards which have been or may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if litigation regarding whether aep properly installed emission control equipment on its plants is resolved against any aep subsidiaries or emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous or if co 2 becomes regulated see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and   note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies included in the 2006 annual reports for more information regarding this litigation and environmental expenditures in general 

 

figures set forth in parentheses reflect amounts invested and later expensed as a result of project cancellation or significant delay 

electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances 

a number of studies in the past several years have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers   

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include i the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and ii the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

electric generation 

facilities 

 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries own or lease approximately 35000 mw of domestic generation see item 2 — properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

apco cspco im kpco and opco are parties to the interconnection agreement defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the interconnection agreement has been approved by the ferc 

the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all aep east companies as of december 31 2006 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

the ohio act was enacted in 2001 to comply with that law cspco and opco functionally separated their generation business from their remaining operations they plan to remain functionally separated through at least december 31 2008 as authorized by their rate stabilization plans approved by the puco cspco and opco have been involved in discussions with various stakeholders in ohio about potential legislation to address the period following the expiration of the rate stabilization plans see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2006 annual reports for more information 

since 1995 apco cspco im kpco and opco have been parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement which provides among other things for the transfer of emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement during the years ended december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 

 

pso swepco and aepsc are parties to a restated and amended operating agreement originally dated as of january 1 1997 csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties the separation of the generation business undertaken by tcc and tnc to comply with the texas act has made the business operations of tcc and tnc incompatible with the csw operating agreement as a result with ferc approval these companies are no longer parties to and no longer supply generating capacity under the csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale in ohio and virginia such rates are based on a statutory formula as those jurisdictions continue to transition to the use of market rates for generation see regulation — rates under item 1 utility operations  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading  below  for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement which has been approved by the ferc provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east companies pso and swepco this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone the separation of the generation business undertaken by tcc and tnc to comply with the texas act has also made the business operations of tcc and tnc incompatible with the system integration agreement as a result with ferc approval these two companies have been removed from this agreement 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts   these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2006 counterparties and exchanges have posted approximately 156 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately 110 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on changes in market power prices exposures change daily 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of power generated by the aep system 

 

variations in the generation of nuclear power are primarily related to refueling and maintenance outages in addition to the sale of tcc’s share of a nuclear generating unit in may 2005 variations in the generation of natural gas power are primarily related to the availability of cheaper alternatives to fulfill certain power requirements and the deactivation or sale of certain gasfired plants owned by tcc and tnc price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels generally result in increased use of other fuels 

coal and lignite  aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations shortterm and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms the price for most solid fuels generally has been increasing management has responded to increases in the price of coal by rebalancing the coal used in its generating facilities with products from different coal regions and sources that have different heat and sulfur contents this rebalancing is an ongoing process that is expected to continue  primarily enabled by the installation of scrubbers at many of our generating facilities management believes but cannot provide assurances that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units through subsidiaries aep owns or leases more than 7000 railcars 600 barges 15 towboats and a coal handling terminal with 20 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in its generating facilities see memco operations for a discussion of aep’s forprofit coal and other drybulk commodity transportation operations that are not part of aep’s utility operations segment 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system during the past three years and the average delivered price of spot coal purchased by system companies 

 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including customers’ usage of electric power space limitations the rate of consumption at particular plants labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt deliveries at december 31 2006 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 44 days of normal usage this estimate assumes that the total supply would be utilized through the operation of plants that use coal most efficiently 

in cases of emergency or shortage system companies have developed programs to conserve coal supplies at their plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with officials of federal and state agencies and in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

natural gas  through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed over 104 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2006 for generating power a majority of the natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of longterm monthly seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant 

nuclear   im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets until it decides that deliveries under longterm supply contracts are warranted 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im anticipates that the cook plant has sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations through 2013 im has initiated a project to study the use of dry cask storage 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by nrc regulations and the snf disposal program the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the cook plant ranges from 733 million to 13 billion in 2006 nondiscounted dollars at december 31 2006 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the cook plant was 974 million the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections 

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements entitled nuclear  included in the 2006 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning 

lowlevel radioactive waste  the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available but south carolina and utah operate lowlevel radioactive waste disposal sites and currently accept lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan im’s access to the south carolina facility is currently allowed through the end of fiscal year 2008 there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to the utah facility 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc and called the mone plant opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2007 as extended following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

certain power agreements 

aegco  since its formation in 1982 aegco’s business has consisted of the ownership and financing of its 50 interest in unit 1 of the rockport plant and since 1989 its 50 leasehold interest in unit 2 of the rockport plant substantially all of the operating revenues of aegco are derived from the sale of capacity and energy associated with its interest in the rockport plant to im and kpco pursuant to unit power agreements which have been approved by the ferc 

the im power agreement provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power and as an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im when added to amounts received by aegco from any other sources such amounts will be at least sufficient to enable aegco to pay all its operating and other expenses including a rate of return on the common equity of aegco as approved by ferc currently 1216 the im power agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts which im would have paid aegco under the terms of the im power agreement for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

aegco and aep have entered into a capital funds agreement pursuant to which among other things aep has unconditionally agreed to make cash capital contributions or in certain circumstances subordinated loans to aegco to the extent necessary to enable aegco to i maintain such an equity component of capitalization as required by governmental regulatory authorities ii provide its proportionate share of the funds required to permit commercial operation of the rockport plant iii enable aegco to perform all of its obligations covenants and agreements under among other things all loan agreements leases and related documents to which aegco is or becomes a party aegco agreements and iv pay all indebtedness obligations and liabilities of aegco aegco obligations under the aegco agreements other than indebtedness obligations or liabilities owing to aep the capital funds agreement will terminate after all aegco obligations have been paid in full 

ovec   aep and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep in ovec is 4347 until september 1 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are now entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their respective power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco cspco im and opco is 4347 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the amended and restated intercompany power agreement which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each will expire by its terms on march 12 2026 aep and the other owners have been evaluating the need for environmental investments related to their ownership interests which are material in december 2006 ovec’s board of directors authorized interim capital expenditures totaling 366 million in order to complete detailed engineering and begin construction of flue gas desulfurization sulfur dioxide scrubber projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills if approved the estimated total cost to complete the projects would be slightly in excess of 1 billion which ovec would expect to finance through issuing debt with the expiration of that provision buckeye is entitled to receive and must pay for power up to its proportionate share of the station 

buckeye on october 1 2004 aep joined pjm and the buckeye transmission service over the aep system was transferred under the pjm open access transmission tariff oatt the cardinal station agreement between opco and buckeye contains a provision that expired in may 2006 under that provision buckeye was entitled to receive and was obligated to pay for the excess of its maximum onehour coincident peak demand plus a 15 reserve margin over the 1226500 kilowatts of capacity of the generating units which buckeye currently owns in the cardinal station such demand which occurred on july 25 2005 was recorded at 1434807 kilowatts with the expiration of that provision buckeye is entitled to receive and must pay for power in amounts equal to its proportionate share of the station 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2—properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates established and approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see regulation—rates  the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1  businessutility operations  regulation—ferc  as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1  businessutility operations  competition  

aep transmission pool 

transmission equalization agreement   apco cspco im kpco and opco operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and coordinated system and are parties to the tea defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the extrahighvoltage transmission system facilities rated 345kv and above and certain facilities operated at lower voltages 138kv up to 345kv the tea has been approved by the ferc sharing under the tea is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies the respective peak demands and memberloadratios as of december 31 2006 are set forth above in the section titled electric generation  aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tea during the years ended december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 

 

transmission coordination agreement   pso swepco tcc tnc and aepsc are parties to the tca the tca has been approved by the ferc and establishes a coordinating committee which is charged with the responsibility of i overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the aep west companies including the performance of transmission planning studies ii the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and iii compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff 

under the tca the aep west companies have delegated to aepsc the responsibility of monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the aep oatt on their behalf prior to september 2005 the tca also provided for the allocation among the aep west companies of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the aep oatt since then these allocations have been determined by the fercapproved oatt for the spp with respect to pso and swepco and puctapproved protocols for ercot with respect to tcc and tnc 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tca prior to september 2005 and pursuant to the spp oatt and ercot protocols as described above during the years ended december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 

 

transmission services for nonaffiliates   in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1  businessutility operations  regional transmission organizations below  transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission   aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep east and aep west companies the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the tea and the tca the system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

on april 24 1996 the ferc issued orders 888 and 889 these orders require each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the orders also require utilities to functionally unbundle their services by requiring them to use their own tariffs in making offsystem and thirdparty sales as part of the orders the ferc issued a proforma tariff that reflects the commission’s views on the minimum nonprice terms and conditions for nondiscriminatory transmission service in addition the orders require all transmitting utilities to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and require utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ system operators from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s merchant energy employees the orders also allow a utility to seek recovery of certain prudently incurred stranded costs that result from unbundled transmission service 

in december 1999 ferc issued order 2000 which provides for the voluntary formation of rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals as a condition of ferc’s approval in 2000 of aep’s merger with csw aep was required to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to one or more rtos the aep east companies integrated into pjm a fercapproved rto on october 1 2004 

swepco and pso are members of the spp in february 2004 the ferc conditionally approved spp as an rto in october 2004 the ferc issued an order granting rto status to spp subject to certain filings the apsc and lpsc have ordered the utilities in those states including our utilities to analyze and submit to them the costs and benefits of rto options available to the utilities certain states in the region have undertaken and released a study investigating the costs and benefits of spp developing into a rto that administers energy and associated markets on august 10 2006 the apsc issued an order approving among other things swepco’s participation in spp subject to certain reporting and continuing oversight conditions 

the remaining aep west companies tcc and tnc are members of ercot

regulation 

general 

except for retail generation sales in ohio virginia and the ercot area of texas aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional regulation by the state utility commissions while still regulated retail sales in michigan are now made at unbundled rates see item 1  utility operations  electric restructuring and customer choice legislation and rates below aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact contains key provisions affecting the electric power industry such as giving the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight the law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of i a utility’s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and ii such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

in many jurisdictions the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in the ercot area of texas our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service in ohio rates are transitioning from bundled costbased rates for electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand and market pricing for andor customer choice of generation on the other historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes while the historical framework remains in a portion of aep’s service territory recovery of increased fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause is no longer provided for in ohio 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction 

indiana  im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc while rates are set on a costofservice basis im’s base rates are capped through june 30 2007 its fuel recovery rate is capped through that time period at a level that automatically increased in january 2006 and january 2007 im expects however that its actual fuel costs will exceed the capped fuel rates permitted through june 30 2007 

ohio  cspco and opco each operated as a functionally separated utility and provided “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act through december 31 2006 the puco approved the rate stabilization plans filed by cspco and opco which among other things address default retail generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 t he ohio supreme court vacated and remanded the puco’s approval of the rate stabilization plans in response the puco issued an order requiring cspco and opco to make additional filings and holding that their rate stabilization plans remained in effect cspco and opco have submitted proposals with the puco addressing the matters identified by the puco retail generation rates will be determined consistent with the rate stabilization plan until december 31 2008 cspco and opco are providing and will continue to provide distribution services to retail customers at rates approved by the puco these rates will be frozen with certain exceptions including automatic annual increases in generation rates of 3 and 7 for cspco and opco respectively from their levels as of december 31 2005 through december 31 2008 transmission services will continue to be provided at rates established by the ferc cspco and opco have been involved in discussions with various stakeholders in ohio about potential legislation to address the period following the expiration of the rate stabilization plans see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2006 annual reports for more information 

oklahoma  pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above the amount included in base rates are recovered by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers when new annual factors are established in november 2006 pso filed a request with the occ seeking an increase in base rates and other rate relief the occ has not yet ruled on this filing see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2006 annual reports for information regarding current rate proceedings 

texas   tcc has sold all of its generation assets and tnc has transferred its active generation capacity to a nonutility affiliate pursuant to a 20year agreement tcc and tnc serve most of their retail customers in the ercot area of texas through nonaffiliated reps tcc and tnc provide retail transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules in november 2006 tcc and tnc filed requests with the puct seeking increases in the rates charged to reps for delivering electricity over their transmission and distribution lines the puct has not ruled on the filings see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2006 annual reports for information on current rate proceedings in august 2006 the puct delayed competition in the spp area of texas until at least january 1 2011 as such swepco’s texas operations continue to operate and to be regulated as a traditional bundled utility with both base and fuel rates 

virginia   apco provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates in february 2007 the virginia legislature adopted amendments to its previouslyenacted electric restructuring law the amendments would cut two years off of the transition period from 2010 to 2008 after which rates for retail generation supply would return to a form of costbased regulation the governor of virginia has not yet signed this legislation apco’s unbundled generation transmission which reflect fercapproved transmission rates and distribution rates as well as its functional separation plan were approved by the vscc in december 2001 apco’s base rates are capped at their mid1999 levels until the end of the transition period now december 31 2010 or sooner if the vscc finds that a competitive market for generation exists in virginia but apco is permitted to seek two changes to its capped rates through december 31 2010 in addition apco is entitled to annual rate changes to recover the incremental costs it incurs for transmission and distribution reliability and compliance with state or federal environmental laws or regulations in may 2006 apco filed a request with the vscc seeking an increase in base rates hearings on this request were held in december 2006 apco expects a ruling in 2007 apco is entitled to adjustments to fuel rates through 2010 to recover its actual fuel costs the fuel component of its purchased power costs and certain capacity charges apco recovers its generation capacity charges through capped base rates in november 2006 the vscc approved apco’s previous request to recover additional environmental and reliabilityrelated costs see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2006 annual reports for additional information on these matters 

west virginia  apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs in july 2006 the wvpsc approved an increase in the retail rates of apco and wpco and the reactivation of their suspended operative fuel clause and other recovery mechanisms see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2006 annual reports for additional information on current rate proceedings 

other jurisdictions  the public utility subsidiaries of aep also provide service at regulated bundled rates in arkansas kentucky louisiana and tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in michigan 

the following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

 

 

ferc 

under the fpa ferc regulates rates for interstate sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers ferc also regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by i approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and ii granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices except for wholesale power that aep delivers within its control area of the spp aep has marketrate authority from ferc under which much of its wholesale marketing activity takes place 

the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both ferc and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

electric restructuring and customer choice legislation 

certain states in aep’s service area have adopted restructuring or customer choice legislation in general this legislation provides for a transition from bundled costbased rate regulated electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service and market pricing for the supply of electricity with customer choice of supplier at a minimum this legislation allows retail customers to select alternative generation suppliers electric restructuring andor customer choice began on january 1 2001 in ohio and on january 1 2002 in michigan virginia and the ercot area of texas electric restructuring in the spp area of texas has been delayed by the puct until at least 2011 aep’s public utility subsidiaries operate in both the ercot and spp areas of texas see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters for additional information 

ohio restructuring 

the ohio act requires vertically integrated electric utility companies that are in the business of providing competitive retail electric service in ohio to separate their generating functions from their transmission and distribution functions following the market development period which ended december 31 2005 retail customers receive distribution and where applicable transmission service from the incumbent utility whose distribution rates are approved by the puco and whose transmission rates are based on rates established by the ferc the puco approved cspco’s and opco’s rate stabilization plans that among other things addressed default generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 see item 1  utility operations  regulation—ferc for a discussion of ferc regulation of transmission rates regulation—rates—ohio and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2006 annual reports  for a discussion of the impact of restructuring on distribution rates the puco authorized cspco and opco to remain functionally separated through the end of that threeyear period the supreme court of ohio vacated and remanded the puco’s order authorizing the rate stabilization plans in response the puco issued an order in august 2006 requiring cspco and opco to make additional filings and holding that the rate stabilization plans remained in effect cspco and opco have submitted proposals with the puco addressing the matters identified by the puco cspco and opco have been involved in discussions with various stakeholders in ohio about potential legislation to address the period following the expiration of the rate stabilization plans 

texas restructuring 

signed into law in june of 1999 the texas act substantially amended the regulatory structure governing electric utilities in texas in order to allow retail electric competition for customers among other things the texas act 

 

 

 

the texas act provides each affected utility an opportunity to recover its generation related regulatory assets and stranded costs resulting from the legal separation of the transmission and distribution utility from the generation facilities and the related introduction of retail electric competition regulatory assets consist of the texas jurisdictional amount of generationrelated regulatory assets and liabilities in the audited financial statements as of december 31 1998 stranded costs consist of the positive excess of the net regulated book value of generation assets as of december 31 2001 over the market value of those assets taking specified factors into account as ultimately determined in a puct trueup proceeding 

in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application or trueup proceeding with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large tcc has appealed seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas act and related rules in a preliminary ruling filed in february 2007 the texas state district court adjudicating the appeal of the final order in the trueup proceeding found that the puct erred in several respects including the method used to determine stranded costs and the awarding of certain carrying costs following the preliminary ruling the court granted a rehearing of the issue regarding the method to determine stranded costs that rehearing is scheduled for late march 2007 tcc intends to appeal any final adverse rulings regarding the puct’s order in the trueup proceedings 

after puct approval in october 2006 tcc issued 174 billion of securitization bonds including additional issuance and carrying costs through the date of issuance the puct authorized negative competition transition charges in the amount of 356 million in october 2006 tcc is required to refund this amount to its ratepayers for a discussion of i regulatory assets and stranded costs subject to recovery by tcc and ii rate adjustments made after implementation of restructuring to allow recovery of certain costs by or with respect to tcc and tnc see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters included in the 2006 annual reports    

michigan customer choice 

customer choice commenced for im’s michigan customers on january 1 2002 rates for retail electric service for im’s michigan customers were unbundled though they continue to be regulated to allow customers the ability to evaluate the cost of generation service for comparison with other suppliers at december 31 2006 none of im’s michigan customers have elected to change suppliers and no alternative electric suppliers are registered to compete in im’s michigan service territory 

virginia restructuring 

in april 2004 the governor of virginia signed legislation that extends the transition period for electricity restructuring including capped rates through december 31 2010 the legislation provides specified cost recovery opportunities during the capped rate period including two optional general base rate changes and an opportunity for timely recovery through a separate rate mechanism of certain incremental environmental and reliability costs incurred on and after july 1 2004   in february 2007 the virginia legislature adopted amendments to its previouslyenacted electric restructuring law the amendments would cut two years off of the transition period from 2010 to 2008 after which rates for retail generation supply would return to a form of costbased regulation the governor of virginia has not yet signed this legislation 

competition 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy in recent years have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with the various state commissions occasionally these rates are first negotiated and then filed with the state commissions the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they are unlikely to be materially adversely affected by this competition 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

memco operations 

our memco business segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the ohio illinois and lower mississippi rivers almost all of our customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport coal and dry bulk commodities for various uses we charge these customers market rates for the purpose of making a profit depending on market conditions and other factors including barge availability we have also served aep utility subsidiary affiliates our affiliated utility customers procure the transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating plants we charge affiliated customers rates that reflect our costs the memco operations include approximately 2038 barges 37 towboats and 10 harbor boats that we own or lease 

competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense with a number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve we compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping rates but also with respect to   customer service available routes valueadded services including scheduling convenience and flexibility information timeliness and equipment since 1980 the industry has experienced consolidation the resulting companies increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers demand for barging services can be seasonal particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall cold winter weather may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we serve are closed 

 

our transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard federal laws state laws and certain international conventions legislation has been proposed that could make our towboats subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

 

generation and marketing 

 

our generation and marketing business segment consists of nonutility generating assets and as of january 2007 a competitive power supply and energy trading business we enter into short and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services primarily in the ercot market the assets utilized in this segment include approximately 791 mw of domestic wind power and gasfired generation facilities of which aep ownership is approximately 551 mw and since january 2007 377 mw of coalfired capacity obtained from tnc’s interest in the oklaunion power station tnc has entered into a 20year power agreement transferring this generating capacity to a nonutility affiliate that we operate in order to comply with the separation requirements of the texas act the power obtained from the oklaunion power station is to be marketed and sold in ercot we are regulated by the puct for transactions inside ercot and by the ferc for transactions outside of ercot while peak load in ercot typically occurs in the summer we do not necessarily expect seasonal variation in our operations 

 

other 

gas operations 

in january 2005 we sold a 98 controlling interest in hpl and related assets with the remaining 2 interest being sold to the buyer in november 2005 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments and assets held for sale  included in the 2006 annual reports for more information as a result management anticipates that our gas marketing operations will be limited to managing our obligations with respect to the gas transactions entered into before these sales 

plaquemine cogeneration facility 

pursuant to an agreement with dow aep constructed an 880 mw cogeneration facility “facility” at dow’s chemical facility in plaquemine louisiana that achieved commercial operation status in 2004 dow used a portion of the energy produced by the facility and sold the excess power to us we agreed to sell up to all of the excess 800 mw to tractebel that power agreement is currently being litigated see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments guarantees and contingencies  in november 2006 we sold our interest in the facility to dow negotiations for the sale resulted in an aftertax impairment of approximately 136 million see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments and assets held for sale 

for information regarding other noncore investments see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments and assets held for sale included in the 2006 annual reports 




 item 1a   risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions   applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction andor acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

our planned capital investment program coincides with a material increase in the price of the fuels used to generate electricity many of our jurisdictions have fuel clauses that permit us to recover these increased fuel costs through rates without a general rate case while prudent capital investment and variable fuel costs each generally warrant recovery in practical terms our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates any such limitation could cause our financial results to be diminished 

our request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in virginia   applies to aep and apco 

apco filed a request with the vscc in may 2006 seeking a net increase in base rates of 198 million to recover increasing costs including a return on equity of 115 apco also requested to apply its offsystem sales margins currently credited to customers through base rates to the fuel factor where they can be adjusted annually apco also requested to retain a portion of the offsystem sales margins in may 2006 the vscc issued an order placing the net requested base rate increase into effect as of october 2 2006 subject to refund in october 2006 the vscc staff filed direct testimony recommending a base rate increase of 13 million with a return on equity of 99 and no offsystem sales margin sharing other intervenors have recommended base rate increases ranging from 42 million to 112 million apco has filed rebuttal testimony and hearings were held in december 2006 if the vscc denies the requested rate recovery it could adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

our request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in texas   applies to aep tcc and tnc 

tcc and tnc have filed requests with the puct to increase their transmission and distribution rates the rate requests include the amounts charged for the delivery of electricity over tcc´s and tnc´s transmission and distribution lines tcc is seeking approval of an 81 million increase which includes the expiration of 20 million in billing credits that the puct required in approving the merger of csw into aep the credits have been in place since 2000 tnc is seeking approval of a 25 million increase which includes the expiration of 62 million in billing credits tcc and tnc are requesting a return on equity of 1125 with a capital structure of approximately 60 debt40 equity if the puct denies the requested rate recovery it could adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

our request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in oklahoma   applies to aep and pso 

pso filed a request with the occ in november 2006 seeking approval of a 50 million overall increase in base rates an annually adjusted rate mechanism to recover the expected significant investment pso will be making in new facilities several new and restructured tariffs to allow pso to begin to reduce the relationship between its revenues and its sales volumes and to implement some demand side management tariffs pso´s planned investments over the next five years include new generation facilities 112 billion new and refurbished transmission substations and lines 302 million and new distribution lines and equipment 582 million if the occ denies the requested rate recovery it could adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to recover all of our fuel costs in indiana applies to aep and im 

im entered into a settlement agreement which the iurc approved in 2005 the approved settlement caps fuel rates through june 2007 at increasing rates during agreedupon intervals im has experienced a cumulative underrecovery of fuel costs through december 2006 if future fuel costs through june 30 2007 continue to exceed the agreedupon caps future results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

the rates that swepco may charge its customers may be reduced applies to swepco 

at the time of the csw merger swepco agreed to file with the lpsc detailed financial information typically utilized in a revenue requirement filing on a periodic basis in order to demonstrate the lack of adverse impact from the merger the first such filing was in october 2002 and the second was in april 2004 both filings indicated swepco’s rates should not be reduced in april 2006 the lpsc and swepco agreed to update the financial information based on a 2005 test year swepco filed financial review schedules in may 2006 showing a return on equity of 944 compared to the previously authorized return on equity of 111 in july 2006 consultants to the lpsc staff filed direct testimony recommending a base rate reduction in the range of 12 million to 20 million for swepco’s louisiana jurisdiction customers which included a 10 return on equity the recommended reduction range is subject to swepco validating certain ongoing operations and maintenance expense levels and the recommended base rate reduction does not include the impact of a proposed consolidated federal income tax adjustment which would increase the proposed rate reduction swepco filed rebuttal testimony in october 2006 refuting the consultants’ recommendations in december 2006 the lpsc staff’s consultants filed reply testimony asserting that swepco’s louisiana base rates are excessive by 17 million which includes a proposed return on equity of 98 swepco filed testimony in the first quarter of 2007 hearings are expected to occur in early 2007 a decision is expected in midtolate 2007 at this time management is unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding if a rate reduction were ultimately ordered it would adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

the amount that pso seeks to recover for fuel costs is currently being reviewed   applies to pso 

in 2002 pso experienced a 44 million underrecovery of fuel costs resulting from a reallocation among aep west companies of purchased power costs for periods prior to january 1 2002 in july 2003 pso filed with the occ offering to collect the underrecovery over 18 months an intervenor the staff of the occ and the attorney general of oklahoma have made filings indicating that recovery should be reduced substantially or disallowed altogether these filings disputed the allocation of aep system offsystem sales margins pursuant to an agreement approved by ferc in september 2003 the occ expanded the case to include a full review of pso’s 2001 fuel and purchased power practices the allocation issue was referred to an alj the alj recommended that the occ lacks authority to examine whether pso deviated from the ferc allocation methodology and that any such complaints should be addressed at the ferc the occ conducted a hearing on the jurisdictional matter in january 2005 but has not issued a decision if the occ determines as a result of the review that a portion of pso’s fuel and purchased power costs should not be recovered there could be an adverse effect on pso’s results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition 

the internal allocation of aep system offsystem sales margins has been challenged applies to apco cspco im kpco and opco 

offsystem sales margins are allocated among the aep system companies pursuant to a fercapproved agreement among those companies entered into at the time of the merger with csw in november 2005 we filed with the ferc a proposed allocation methodology to be used in 2006 and beyond the original allocations have been challenged in different forums including pso’s fuel clause recovery proceeding before the occ in general the challenges assert that aep west companies acquired in the merger with csw are being allocated a disproportionately small amount of the offsystem sales margins an alj in the occ proceeding and separately a federal district court in texas have each held that the ferc is the only appropriate adjudicator of such challenges this holding has been affirmed by a federal appellate court no proceeding questioning the allocation of our offsystem sales is currently before the ferc the occ however has yet to rule on whether it has jurisdiction over this issue if the ferc or another entity of competent authority were to retroactively allocate additional offsystem sales margins to the aep west companies the aep east companies may be required to pay money to the aep west companies any such payments could have an adverse effect on the results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition of the aep east companies 

the base rates that certain of our utilities charge are currently capped or frozen applies to aep cspco im and opco 

base rates charged to customers in michigan and ohio are currently either frozen or capped to the extent our costs in these states exceed the applicable cap or frozen rate those costs are not recoverable from customers 

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

unless mitigated by timely and adequate regulatory recovery the cost of repairing damage to our utility facilities due to storms natural disasters wars terrorist acts and other catastrophic events in excess of insurance coverage when applicable may adversely impact our revenues operating and capital expenses and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2143 mw or 6 of our generation capacity we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at a nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing transmission regulatory structures which could affect our performance in these regions applies to each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets problems or delays that may arise in the operation of new regional transmission organization rto power markets may restrict our ability to sell power produced by our generating capacity to certain markets if there is insufficient transmission capacity available to fully support market operation the rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional power markets or the manner in which rtos will evolve or the regions they will cover we are unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets may have on our business 

aep east companies joined pjm on october 1 2004 swepco and pso are members of spp in february 2004 ferc granted rto status to spp subject to fulfilling specified requirements in october 2004 the ferc issued an order granting final rto status to spp subject to certain filings 

the lpsc has ordered the utilities subject to its jurisdiction including swepco to analyze and submit to them the costs and benefits of rto options available to the utilities certain states in the region have undertaken and released a study investigating the costs and benefits of spp developing into a rto that administers energy and associated markets 

to the extent we are faced with conflicting state and federal requirements as to our participation in rtos it could adversely affect our ability to operate and recover transmission costs from retail customers management is unable to predict the outcome of these transmission regulatory actions and proceedings or their impact on the timing and operation of rtos our transmission operations or future results of operations and cash flows 

the amount we charged third parties for using our transmission facilities has been reduced is subject to refund and may not be completely restored in the future   applies to aep and aep east companies  

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and the miso to make compliance filings for their respective tariffs to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within those rtos the elimination of the to rates reduces the transmission service revenues collected by the rtos and thereby reduces the revenues received by transmission owners under the rtos’ revenue distribution protocols to mitigate the impact of lost to revenues the ferc approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost allocation seca transition rates beginning in december 2004 and extending through march 2006 intervenors objected to this decision therefore the seca fees we collected  220 million are subject to refund approximately 19 million of the seca revenues that we billed were never collected the aep east zone public utilities filed a motion with the ferc to force payment of these seca billings 

a hearing was held in may 2006 to determine whether any of the seca revenues should be refunded in august 2006 the alj issued an initial decision finding that the rate design for the recovery of seca charges was flawed and that a large portion of the “lost revenues” reflected in the seca rates were not recoverable the alj found that the seca rates charged were unfair unjust and discriminatory and that new compliance filings and refunds should be made the alj also found that unpaid seca rates must be paid in the recommended reduced amount the ferc has not ruled on the matter if the ferc upholds the decision of the alj up to 126 million of collected seca rates could be refunded by the aep east zone public utilities we have recorded provisions in the aggregate amount of 37 million related to the potential refund of seca rates pending settlement negotiations with various intervenors 

seca transition rates expired at the end of march 2006 and did not fully compensate aep for ongoing lost to revenues  as a result of rate relief in certain jurisdictions however approximately 85 of the ongoing lost to revenues are now being recovered from native load customers of aep east companies in those jurisdictions  the portion attributable to virginia is being collected subject to refund   

in addition to seeking retail rate recovery from native load customers in the applicable states aep and another member of pjm have filed an application with the ferc seeking compensation from other unaffiliated members of pjm for the costs associated with those members’ use of our respective transmission assets a majority of pjm members have filed in opposition to the proposal hearings were held in april 2006 an alj recommended a rate design that would result in greater recovery for aep than the proposal aep had submitted the alj also recommended however that the design be phasedin which could limit the amount of recovery for aep the ferc has not yet ruled on this matter management cannot at this time estimate the outcome of these proceedings 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of costs   applies to each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time additionally there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered while rate regulation is premised on providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of our costs in a timely manner 

we operate in a nonuniform and fluid regulatory environment applies to each registrant 

in addition to the multiple levels of state regulation at the states in which we operate our business is subject to extensive federal regulation there can be no assurance that 1 the federal legislative and regulatory initiatives which have occurred over the past few years and which have generally facilitated competition in the energy sector will continue or will not be reversed or 2 state regulation will not become significantly more restrictive further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate will impact the effectiveness of our business plan and may because of the continued uncertainty harm our financial condition and results of operations 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity  applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforeseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power from the market we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers because some of the states we operate in do not allow us to increase our rates in response to increased fuel cost charges since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage were brief we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses applies to each registrant other than aegco 

following the bankruptcy of enron the credit ratings agencies initiated a thorough review of the capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings of energy companies including us the agencies revised ratings at that time further negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

if moody’s or sp were to downgrade the longterm rating of any of the registrants  particularly below investment grade the borrowing costs of that registrant would increase which would diminish its financial results in addition the registrant’s potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep would be subject to regulatory or contractual restrictions 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis  applies to each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives we are exposed to the risk of substantial price increases in the costs of materials used in construction we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services as a result we are also exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance  applies to each registrant 

we are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise are not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances based on the amount of coal we use as fuel and the reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures according to our estimates we have procured sufficient emission allowances to cover our projected needs for the next two years and for much of the projected needs for periods beyond that at some point however we may have to obtain additional allowances and those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to market prices of natural gas natural gas prices tend to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources 

the price trends for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material increases in the recent past changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal emission allowances or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers in addition the prices we can charge our retail customers in some jurisdictions are capped 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

in certain jurisdictions we have limited ability to pass on our fuel costs to our customers applies to aep cspco im and opco 

we are exposed to risk from changes in the market prices of coal natural gas and emissions allowances used to generate power where generation is no longer regulated or where existing fuel clauses are suspended or frozen the prices of coal natural gas and emissions allowances have increased materially in the recent past the protection afforded by retail fuel clause recovery mechanisms has been eliminated by the implementation of customer choice in ohio which represents approximately 20 of our fuel costs because the risk of generating costs cannot be passed through to customers as a matter of right in ohio we retain these risks we also have a fuel cap in indiana that may not allow us to fully recover our fuel costs there if we cannot recover an amount sufficient to cover our actual fuel costs our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

we are exposed to losses resulting from the bankruptcy of enron corp applies to aep 

on june 1 2001 we purchased houston pipe line company “hpl” from enron corp “enron” later that year enron and its subsidiaries filed bankruptcy proceedings in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york various hpl related contingencies and indemnities from enron remained unsettled at the date of enron’s bankruptcy in connection with the 2001 acquisition of hpl we entered into an agreement with bam lease company which granted hpl the exclusive right to use approximately 65 bcf of cushion gas required for the normal operation of the bammel gas storage facility at the time of our acquisition of hpl bank of america “boa” and certain other banks together with boa “boa syndicate” and enron entered into an agreement granting hpl the exclusive use of 65 bcf of cushion gas additionally enron and the boa syndicate released hpl from all prior and future liabilities and obligations in connection with the financing arrangement after the enron bankruptcy hpl was informed by the boa syndicate of a purported default by enron under the terms of the financing arrangement we purchased 10 bcf of gas from enron and are currently litigating the rights to the remaining 55 bcf of cushion gas 

in february 2004 in connection with boa’s dispute enron filed notices of rejection regarding the cushion gas use agreement and other incidental agreements we have objected to enron’s attempted rejection of these agreements in 2005 we sold hpl including the bammel gas storage facility we indemnified the purchaser for damages if any arising from the litigation with boa the case in federal court in texas is set for trial beginning april 2007 management is unable to predict the final resolution of these disputes however the impact on results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be material 

risks relating to state restructuring 

in ohio our costs may not be recovered and rates may be reduced applies to aep opco and cspco 

in january 2005 the puco approved rate stabilization plans “rsps” for cspco and opco the rsps provide among other things for cspco and opco to raise their generation rates on an annual basis through 2008 by 3 and 7 respectively the rsps also provide for possible additional annual generation rate increases of up to an average of 4 per year for specified costs the rsps also provide that cspco and opco can recover certain environmental carrying costs pjmrelated administrative costs and certain congestion costs in 2006 cspco and opco collected an additional estimated 244 million in gross margin as a result of the rsps this amount is expected to increase in 2007 and 2008 

in 2005 the ohio consumers’ counsel filed an appeal to the ohio supreme court that challenged the validity of the rsps under ohio’s electricity restructuring law in july 2006 the ohio supreme court vacated the puco’s rsp orders for cspco and opco and remanded the case to the puco for further proceedings 

in august 2006 the puco directed cspco and opco to file a plan providing an option for customer participation in the electric market through competitive bids or other reasonable means the puco also held that the rsps shall remain effective accordingly the ohio companies continued collecting rsp revenues in september 2006 cspco and opco submitted their proposals to provide additional options for customer participation in the electric market if the puco were to reverse or limit the rsps our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

some laws and regulations governing restructuring in virginia have not yet been interpreted or adopted and could harm our business operating results and financial condition applies to aep and apco 

virginia restructuring legislation was enacted in 1999 providing for retail choice of generation suppliers to be phased in over two years beginning january 1 2002 it required jurisdictional utilities to unbundle their power supply and energy delivery rates and to file functional separation plans by january 1 2002 apco filed its plan with the vscc and following vscc approval of a settlement agreement now operates in virginia as a functionally separated electric utility charging unbundled rates for its retail sales of electricity the settlement agreement addressed functional separation leaving decisions related to legal separation for later vscc consideration while the electric restructuring law in virginia established the general framework governing the retail electric market it required the vscc to issue rules and determinations implementing the law some of the regulations governing the retail electric market have not yet been adopted by the vscc when the regulations are developed and adopted compliance with them may harm our business results of operations and financial condition   in february 2007 the virginia legislature adopted amendments to its electric restructuring law the amendments would cut two years off of the transition period from 2010 to 2008 after which rates for retail generation supply would return to a form of costbased regulation the governor of virginia has not yet signed this legislation 

there is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in texas applies to aep and tcc 

restructuring legislation in texas required utilities with stranded costs to use marketbased methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs we elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of the generation assets of tcc for stranded cost purposes in general terms the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount by which the book value of generating assets including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized exceeds the market value of the generation assets as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in april 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion we have appealed the puct’s final order seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas act and related rules other parties have appealed the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large in a preliminary ruling filed in february 2007 the texas state district court adjudicating the appeal of the final order in the trueup proceeding found that the puct erred in several respects including the method used to determine stranded costs and the awarding of certain carrying costs following the preliminary ruling the court granted a rehearing of the issue regarding the method to determine stranded costs that rehearing is scheduled for late march 2007 tcc intends to appeal any final adverse rulings regarding the puct’s order in the trueup proceeding if the district court judge’s preliminary determination that tcc used an improper method to value its stranded costs is ultimately upheld on appeal it could substantially reduce tcc’s stranded costs we cannot estimate the amount of any potential impact at this time but it could exceed tcc’s common shareholder’s equity at december 31 2006 any reduction of the recovery authorized in the puct’s order could have a material adverse effect on results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps   applies to aep tcc and tnc 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately sixty reps the two largest customers of tcc accounted for 29 of its operating revenues in 2006 the three largest customers of tnc accounted for 50 of its operating revenues in 2006 adverse economic conditions structural problems in the new texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could harm our cash flow and profitability applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase all of our estimates are subject to significant uncertainties about the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables including timing of implementation required levels of reductions allocation requirements of the new rules and our selected compliance alternatives as a result we cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty the actual costs to comply could differ significantly from the estimates all of the costs are incremental to our current investment base and operating cost structure 

if federal andor state requirements are imposed on electric utility companies mandating further emission reductions including limitations on co 2 emissions such requirements could make some of our electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses environmental advocacy groups other organizations and some agencies in the united states are focusing considerable attention on carbon dioxide emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change although several bills have been introduced in congress that would compel co 2 emission reductions none have advanced through the legislature future changes in environmental regulations governing these pollutants could make some of our electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate in addition any legal obligation that would require us to substantially reduce our emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and in the case of co 2 legislation would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels particularly coal as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities while mandatory requirements for further emission reductions from our fossil fleet do not appear to be imminent we continue to monitor regulatory and legislative developments in this area 

governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations   applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations even if caused by factors beyond our control that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us recent lawsuits by the epa and various states filed against us highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities in general and coalfired generating facilities in particular 

since 1999 we have been involved in litigation regarding generating plant emissions under the caa the epa and a number of states alleged that we and other unaffiliated utilities modified certain units at coalfired generating plants in violation of the caa the epa filed complaints against certain aep subsidiaries in us district court for the southern district of ohio a separate lawsuit initiated by certain special interest groups was consolidated with the epa case the alleged modification of the generating units occurred over a 20year period a bench trial on the liability issues was held during july 2005 briefing has concluded but the court is holding the case in abeyance until the us supreme court rules on a similar case no decision has been issued additionally in july 2004 attorneys general of eight states and others sued aep and other utilities alleging that carbon dioxide emissions from power generating facilities constitute a public nuisance under federal common law the trial court dismissed the suits and plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal while we believe the claims are without merit the costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide emissions could harm our business and our results of operations and financial position 

if these or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay penalties andor halt operations moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market or other competitive power markets or on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions we are generally not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets power supply and other similar agreements entered into during extreme market conditions may subsequently be held to be unenforceable by a reviewing court or ferc fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 

volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our power trading including coal gas and e mission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities applies to each registrant other than aeg tcc and tnc 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing of risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our pooled electric generating facilities successfully applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities operating electric generating facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

a decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities applies to each registrant other than aeg tcc and tnc 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market

cook nuclear plant 

the following table provides operating information relating to the cook plant 

 

 

 

costs associated with the operation excluding fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities im may also incur costs and experience reduced output at cook plant because of the design criteria prevailing at the time of construction and the age of the plant’s systems and equipment nuclear industrywide and cook plant initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and maintenance costs at these plants however the ability of im to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured such costs may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs 

in addition to the generating facilities described above aep has ownership interests in other electrical generating facilities information concerning these facilities at december 31 2006 is listed below

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments and assets held for sale included in the 2006 annual reports for a discussion of aep’s disposition of independent power producer and foreign generation assets 

transmission and distribution facilities 

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the aep system and its operating companies and that portion of the total representing 765kv lines 

 

 

 

 

titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

substantially all the fixed physical properties and franchises of swepco except for limited exceptions are subject to the lien of its mortgage and deed of trust securing its first mortgage bonds 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

general 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts 35 billion 30 billion and 30 billion of construction expenditures for 2007 2008 and 2009 respectively estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital   

proposed transmission facilities 

pjm project 

aep has filed a proposal with the ferc and the pjm to build a new 765kv transmission line stretching from west virginia to new jersey the proposed transmission corridor will span approximately 550 miles and is designed to reduce pjm congestion costs through enhancing transfer capability and also to reduce transmission line losses it also is expected to improve reliability in the eastern transmission grid aep´s proposed transmission line called the aep interstate project would originate at aep´s amos transmission station in putnam county wv connect through doubs station in frederick county md and terminate at the deans station in middlesex county nj the proposed route follows a corridor conceptually identified by pjm as a transmission route needed to address transmission congestion within the pjm footprint exact routing of the line would be determined after pjm approves the project aep will work with pjm other affected transmission owners and stakeholders throughout the siting process it is expected that a new aep subsidiary aep transmission co llc will own the line and undertake construction of the project the projected costs are approximately 3 billion which may be shared with other stakeholders the anticipated inservice date is 2015 assuming three years to site and acquire rightsofway and five years to build the line this projected inservice date also assumes approval by pjm in mid2007 followed by approval by ferc on initial rates by the end of 2007 

aep also has filed with the doe in its efforts to designate national interest electric transmission corridors nietc epact provides for nietc designation for areas that are experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers in august 2006 the doe issued the “national interest electric transmission congestion study” in this study doe indicated that the midatlantic coastal area which the aep project is designed to reinforce is one of the two most critical congestion areas in the nation this finding should help aep to obtain early nietc designation as promulgated by epact in october 2006 we filed comments with the doe encouraging corridor designation that is consistent with the proposed line 

in july 2006 pursuant to a request by aep the ferc clarified that the project qualifies for incentive rate treatment provided that the new line is included in pjm’s formal regional transmission expansion plan to be finalized in 2007 the approved incentives include a a return on equity set at the high end of the “zone of reasonableness” b the option to timely recover the cost of capital associated with construction work in progress and c the ability to defer expense and recover costs incurred during the preconstruction and preoperating period since the ferc has clarified that the project qualifies for these rate incentives we expect to propose rates that will capture the incentives in future ferc rate filings 

ercot joint venture 

in november 2006 aep announced a memorandum of understanding with midamerican energy holdings co midamerican to form a joint venture company to build and own new electric transmission assets in ercot in january 2007 we signed a participation agreement with midamerican to form a joint venture company electric transmission texas llc ett to fund own and operate electric transmission assets in ercot ett filed with the puct in january 2007 requesting regulatory approval to operate as an electric transmission utility in texas to transfer from tcc to ett approximately 76 million of transmission assets currently under construction to sell or transfer ownership of ett as discussed below and to establish a wholesale transmission tariff for ett ett also requested approval of initial rates based on an 1125 return on equity 

upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals respective subsidiaries of aep and of midamerican each will acquire a 50 equity ownership in ett the anticipated utility capitalization structure of ett is approximately 40 equity and 60 debt aep and midamerican expect ett to invest in additional transmission projects in ercot the companies anticipate in excess of 1 billion in projects could be included in the new company during the next several years tcc also made a regulatory filing at the ferc in february 2007 regarding the transfer of transmission assets from tcc to ett in february 2007 ett filed a proposal with the puct that addresses the competitive renewable energy zone initiative of the texas legislature the proposal outlines the opportunities for additional significant investment in transmission assets in texas the joint venture is anticipated to begin operations in the second half of 2007 subject to regulatory approval from the puct and the ferc

in conjunction with an environmental impact study issued in august 2004 we announced plans to construct a synthesisgasfired plant or plants of approximately 1200 mw of capacity in the next five to six years utilizing integrated gasification combined cycle igcc technology we originally estimated construction and other direct costs would equal approximately 12 billion for each nominal 629 mw facility we currently expect these estimates to be exceeded in amounts that are not yet determinable and that may be material we are currently completing frontend engineering and design on the facilities pursuant to an agreement with general electric and bechtel power corporation and are working with state regulators and legislators to establish a framework for expedient recovery of this significant investment in new clean coal technology 

the plans are contingent upon receiving adequate cost recovery through rates approved by the applicable commission prior to beginning construction   in january 2006 apco filed a petition with the wvpsc requesting its approval of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct a 600 mw igcc plant adjacent to apco’s existing mountaineer generating station in mason county wv in january 2007 the wvpsc issued an order setting a deadline of december 3 2007 for it to rule on apco’s filing 

in march 2005 opco and cspco filed a joint application with the puco seeking authority to recover costs related to building and operating a new 600 mw igcc power plant using cleancoal technology the application proposed for cost recovery associated with the igcc plant in three phases in april 2006 the puco issued an order authorizing opco and cspco to implement phase 1 of their cost recovery proposal in june 2006 the puco issued another order approving a tariff to recover phase 1 preconstruction costs in its june order the puco indicated that if the ohio companies have not commenced continuous construction of the igcc plant within five years of the order all charges collected for preconstruction costs must be refunded to ohio ratepayers with interest the puco deferred ruling on phases 2 and 3 cost recovery until further hearings are held no date for a further hearing has been set

classes of service 

the principal classes of service from which the public utility subsidiaries of aep derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the year ended december 31 2005 are as follows 

 

 

                

 

 

 

 

  epact and the repeal of puhca 

epact was signed into law on august 8 2005 among other things epact repealed puhca effective february 8 2006 puhca regulated many significant aspects of a registered holding company system such as the aep system puhca limited the operations of a registered holding company system to a single integrated public utility system and such other businesses as were incidental or necessary to the operations of the system puhca also required that transactions between associated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at cost with limited exceptions as a result of puhca’s repeal utility holding companies including the aep system are no longer limited to a single integrated public utility system further utility holding companies are no longer restricted from acquiring businesses that may not be related to the utility business jurisdiction over certain holding company related activities has been transferred to the ferc specifically the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both ferc and state regulators will be permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system 

epact contains key provisions affecting the electric power industry these provisions include tax changes for the utility industry incentives for emissions reductions and federal insurance and incentives to build new nuclear power plants it gives the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight the law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases the law required the ferc to issue certain regulations implementing epact within 120 days of enactment we have reviewed the proposed rules and are participating in the public comment process however we cannot currently predict what impact the final rules will have on our financial condition and results of operations 

aepcsw merger 

on june 15 2000 a wholly owned merger subsidiary of aep merged with and into csw now known as aep utilities inc as a result csw became a wholly owned subsidiary of aep the four wholly owned public utility subsidiaries of csw  pso swepco tcc and tnc  became indirect wholly owned public utility subsidiaries of aep as a result of the merger the merger was approved by the ferc and the sec 

on january 18 2002 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that the sec failed to properly explain how the merger met the requirements of puhca and remanded the case to the sec for further review upon puhca’s repeal in february 2006 we received a letter from the sec which formally dismissed the proceeding challenging our merger 

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs shortterm debt is also used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt in recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and aep’s commercial paper program funds are made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and a 50 million crossacceleration provision at december 31 2005 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2005 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as leasing arrangements including the leasing of utility assets and coal mining and transportation equipment and facilities 

credit ratings 

in september 2005 moody’s upgraded aep’s senior unsecured rating to baa2 from baa3 and its commercial paper rating to prime2 from prime3 there were no changes in the ratings or rating outlook for aep’s rated subsidiaries in 2005 sp and fitch did not change the ratings of aep or its rated subsidiaries during 2005

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that are potentially material to the aep system include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines injunctive relief and other sanctions see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters  included in the 2005 annual reports   for further information with respect to environmental issues  

if our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices in deregulated jurisdictions those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition 

the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system 

see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies included in the 2005 annual reports for further information with respect to environmental matters 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2004 and 2005 and the current estimates for 2006 2007 and 2008 are shown below in each case excluding afudc substantial investments in addition to the amounts set forth below are expected by the system in future years in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls in order to comply with air and water quality standards which have been or may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if litigation regarding whether aep properly installed emission control equipment on its plants is resolved against any aep subsidiaries or emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and   note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies included in the 2005 annual reports for more information regarding this litigation and environmental expenditures in general 

 

historical and projected environmental investments 

 

electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances 

a number of studies in the past several years have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers   

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include i the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and ii the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

electric generation 

facilities 

 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries own or lease approximately 35000 mw of domestic generation see item 2 — properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

apco cspco im kpco and opco are parties to the interconnection agreement dated july 6 1951 as amended interconnection agreement defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the interconnection agreement has been approved by the ferc 

the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone public utility subsidiaries as of december 31 2005 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

the ohio act was enacted in 2001 to comply with that law cspco and opco functionally separated their generation business from their remaining operations they plan to remain functionally separated through at least december 31 2008 as authorized by their rate stabilization plan approved by the puco see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled ohio regulatory activity included in the 2005 annual reports under the heading entitled significant factors and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring  included in the 2005 annual reports for more information 

since 1995 apco cspco im kpco and opco have been parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement allowance agreement which provides among other things for the transfer of emission allowances associated with transactions under the interconnection agreement the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement and the allowance agreement during the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 

 

pso swepco tcc tnc and aepsc are parties to a restated and amended operating agreement originally dated as of january 1 1997 csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires the west zone public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other aep west zone public utility subsidiaries as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties the separation of the generation business undertaken by tcc and tnc to comply with the texas act has made the business operations of tcc and tnc incompatible with the csw operating agreement we have applied with the ferc to remove these two companies from the csw operating agreement upon approval or earlier for tcc if the sale of its interest in the oklaunion plant occurs first these companies will no longer supply generating capacity under the csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 

 

power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers or in the case of the ercot area of texas to reps by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved other than in the ercot area of texas by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale in ohio and virginia such rates are based on a statutory formula as those jurisdictions continue to transition to the use of market rates for generation see regulation — rates under item 1 utility operations  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading  below  for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement which has been approved by the ferc provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east and west zone operating subsidiaries this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each zone the separation of the generation business undertaken by tcc and tnc to comply with the texas act has made the business operations of tcc and tnc incompatible with the system integration agreement as a result we have applied with the ferc to remove these two companies from this agreement 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aepsc sells excess power into the market and engages in power natural gas coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas coal and emissions allowances under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts   these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2005 counterparties and exchanges have posted approximately 324 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately 127 million with counterparties and exchanges since open trading contracts are valued based on changes in market power prices exposures change daily 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of power generated by the aep system 

 

variations in the generation of nuclear power are primarily related to refueling and maintenance outages and to the sale of tcc’s share of stp in may 2005 variations in the generation of natural gas power are primarily related to the availability of cheaper alternatives to fulfill certain power requirements and the deactivation or sale of certain gasfired plants owned by tcc and tnc price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels generally result in increased use of other fuels 

coal and lignite  aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations shortterm and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms the price for coal fuels increased in 2005 and we expect that this trend may continue management has responded to increases in the price of coal by rebalancing the coal used in its generating facilities with products from different coal regions and sources of differing heat and sulfur contents this rebalancing is an ongoing process that is expected to continue management believes but cannot provide assurances that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units see item 1  investmentsother for a discussion of aep’s coal marketing and transportation operations 

the following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the aep system during the past three years and the average delivered price of spot coal purchased by system companies 

 

the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including customers’ usage of electric power space limitations the rate of consumption at particular plants labor issues and weather conditions that may interrupt deliveries at december 31 2005 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 30 days of normal usage 

in cases of emergency or shortage system companies have developed programs to conserve coal supplies at their plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with officials of federal and state agencies and in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

natural gas  through its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed over 109 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2005 for generating power a majority of the natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery reliability a portfolio of longterm monthly and seasonal firm purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant 

nuclear   im has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant steps currently are being taken based upon the planned fuel cycles for the cook plant to review evaluate and fulfill im’s requirements for the supply of nuclear fuel im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets until it decides that deliveries under longterm supply contracts are warranted 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago im anticipates that the cook plant has sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations through 2013 im has initiated a project to study the use of dry cask storage 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

as the owner of the cook plant im has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant will not be significantly different than current projections 

see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies  included in the 2005 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning and related litigation 

lowlevel radioactive waste  the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available im cannot predict when such a site may be available but south carolina and utah operate lowlevel radioactive waste disposal sites and currently accept lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan im’s access to the south carolina facility is currently allowed through the end of fiscal year 2008 there is currently no set date limiting im’s access to the utah facility 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc and called the mone plant opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the mone plant and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through may 2006 following that npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the mone plant and both parties will generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs of the facility 

certain power agreements 

aegco  since its formation in 1982 aegco’s business has consisted of the ownership and financing of its 50 interest in unit 1 of the rockport plant and since 1989 leasing of its 50 interest in unit 2 of the rockport plant the operating revenues of aegco are derived from the sale of capacity and energy associated with its interest in the rockport plant to im and kpco pursuant to unit power agreements which have been approved by the ferc 

the im power agreement provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power and as an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im when added to amounts received by aegco from any other sources such amounts will be at least sufficient to enable aegco to pay all its operating and other expenses including a rate of return on the common equity of aegco as approved by ferc currently 1216 the im power agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts which im would have paid aegco under the terms of the im power agreement for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement expires in december 2022 

aegco and aep have entered into a capital funds agreement pursuant to which among other things aep has unconditionally agreed to make cash capital contributions or in certain circumstances subordinated loans to aegco to the extent necessary to enable aegco to i maintain such an equity component of capitalization as required by governmental regulatory authorities ii provide its proportionate share of the funds required to permit commercial operation of the rockport plant iii enable aegco to perform all of its obligations covenants and agreements under among other things all loan agreements leases and related documents to which aegco is or becomes a party aegco agreements and iv pay all indebtedness obligations and liabilities of aegco aegco obligations under the aegco agreements other than indebtedness obligations or liabilities owing to aep the capital funds agreement will terminate after all aegco obligations have been paid in full 

ovec   aep cspco and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec in april 2004 aep agreed to sell a portion of its shares in ovec 73 of ovec to louisville gas and electric company the sale was completed in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the sale the aggregate equity participation of aep and cspco in ovec decreased from 442 to 4347 until september 1 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are now entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco cspco im and opco is 421 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the intercompany power agreement icpa which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each will expire by its terms on march 12 2006 an amended and restated icpa has been unanimously approved and executed by the sponsoring companies and ovec the amended agreement filed with and accepted by ferc extends the term of the icpa for an additional 20 years to march 13 2026 the aggregate power participation ratio of the aep entities in the amended and restated icpa is 4347 the aepaffiliated owners of ovec and the other owners are evaluating the need for environmental investments related to their ownership interests which may be material 

buckeye on october 1 2004 aep joined pjm and the buckeye transmission service over the aep system was transferred under the pjm oatt buckeye is entitled under the cardinal station agreement to receive and is obligated to pay for the excess of its maximum onehour coincident peak demand plus a 15 reserve margin over the 1226500 kilowatts of capacity of the generating units which buckeye currently owns in the cardinal station such demand which occurred on july 25 2005 was recorded at 1434807 kilowatts 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2—properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates established and approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see regulation—rates  the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see item 1  businessutility operations  regulation—ferc  as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see item 1  businessutility operations  competition  

aep transmission pool 

transmission equalization agreement   apco cspco im kpco and opco operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and coordinated system and are parties to the transmission equalization agreement dated april 1 1984 as amended tea defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the extrahighvoltage transmission system facilities rated 345kv and above and certain facilities operated at lower voltages 138kv up to 345kv the tea has been approved by the ferc sharing under the tea is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the memberloadratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies as of december 31 2005 the memberloadratios were as follows 

 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tea during the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 

 

transmission coordination agreement   pso swepco tcc tnc and aepsc are parties to the tca the tca has been approved by the ferc and establishes a coordinating committee which is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the west zone public utility subsidiaries including the performance of transmission planning studies the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff 

under the tca the west zone public utility subsidiaries have delegated to aepsc the responsibility of monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the aep oatt on their behalf the tca also provides for the allocation among the west zone public utility subsidiaries of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the aep oatt 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tca during the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 

 

transmission services for nonaffiliates   in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries through rtos also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see item 1  businessutility operations  regional transmission organizations below  transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission   aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep’s east and west zone public utility subsidiaries the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the tea and the tca the system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 

 

 

the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

on april 24 1996 the ferc issued orders 888 and 889 these orders require each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the orders also require utilities to functionally unbundle their services by requiring them to use their own tariffs in making offsystem and thirdparty sales as part of the orders the ferc issued a proforma tariff that reflects the commission’s views on the minimum nonprice terms and conditions for nondiscriminatory transmission service in addition the orders require all transmitting utilities to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and require utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ system operators from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s merchant energy employees the orders also allow a utility to seek recovery of certain prudently incurred stranded costs that result from unbundled transmission service 

in december 1999 ferc issued order 2000 which provides for the voluntary formation of rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals as a condition of ferc’s approval in 2000 of aep’s merger with csw aep was required to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to one or more rtos the aep east companies integrated into pjm a fercapproved rto on october 1 2004 

swepco and pso are members of the spp in february 2004 the ferc conditionally approved spp as an rto in october 2004 the ferc issued an order granting rto status to spp subject to certain filings the arkansas public service commission and lpsc are concerned about the effect on retail ratepayers of utilities in louisiana and arkansas joining rtos these commissions have ordered the utilities in those states including our utilities to analyze and submit to them the costs and benefits of rto options available to the utilities certain states in the region have undertaken and released a study investigating the costs and benefits of spp developing into a rto that administers energy and associated markets 

the remaining west zone public utility subsidiaries tcc and tnc are members of ercot

regulation 

general 

except for retail generation sales in ohio virginia and the ercot area of texas aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional regulation by the state utility commissions while still regulated retail sales in michigan are now made at unbundled rates see item 1  utility operations  electric restructuring and customer choice legislation and rates below aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa im is subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant aep and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of epact much of which is administered by the ferc epact contains key provisions affecting the electric power industry these provisions include tax changes for the utility industry incentives for emissions reductions and federal insurance and incentives to build new nuclear power plants it gives the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight the law also provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of i a utility’s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and ii such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in ohio virginia and the ercot area of texas rates are transitioning from bundled costbased rates for electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand and market pricing for andor customer choice of generation on the other in ohio the puco has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by opco and cspco which among other things address retail generation service rates through december 31 2008 in virginia apco’s base rates are currently capped subject to certain adjustments described below at their mid1999 levels until december 31 2010 or sooner if the vscc finds that a competitive market for generation exists in virginia 

historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes while the historical framework remains in a portion of aep’s service territory recovery of increased fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause is no longer provided for in ohio we are seeking to reactivate fuel clause mechanisms in west virginia and have received approval from the wvpsc to begin deferral accounting associated with the fuel clause mechanism effective july 1 2006 fuel recovery is also limited in the ercot area of texas but because we mainly serve customers through unaffiliated reps there is little impact on aep of fuel recovery procedures related to service in ercot 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of each jurisdiction in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction 

indiana  im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc while rates are set on a costofservice basis im’s base rates are capped through june 30 2007 its fuel recovery rate is capped through that time period at a level that automatically increased in january 2006 and will do so again in january 2007 im expects however that its actual fuel costs will exceed the capped fuel rates permitted through june 30 2007 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  im indiana settlement agreement included in the 2005 annual reports for more information 

ohio  cspco and opco each operated as a functionally separated utility and provided “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act through december 31 2005 the puco approved the rate stabilization plan filed by cspco and opco which among other things addresses default retail generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 t he ohio consumers counsel has appealed the puco’s approval of the rate stabilization plans retail generation rates will be determined consistent with the rate stabilization plan until december 31 2008 cspco and opco are providing and will continue to provide distribution services to retail customers at rates approved by the puco these rates will be frozen with certain exceptions including automatic annual increases in generation rates of 3 and 7 for cspco and opco respectively from their levels as of december 31 2005 through december 31 2008 transmission services will continue to be provided at rates established by the ferc see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring  included in the 2005 annual reports for more information 

oklahoma  pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above the amount included in base rates are recovered by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers when new annual factors are established see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2005 annual reports for information regarding current rate proceedings 

texas   tcc has sold substantially all of its generation assets and tnc currently operates on a functionally separated basis tcc and tnc serve most of their retail customers in the ercot area of texas through nonaffiliated reps tcc and tnc provide retail transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules see notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters and customer choice and industry restructuring  respectively included in the 2005 annual reports for information on current rate proceedings and tcc’s trueup proceedings 

in may 2003 the puct delayed competition in the spp area of texas until at least january 1 2007 as such swepco’s texas operations continue to operate and to be regulated as a traditional bundled utility with both base and fuel rates 

virginia   apco provides retail electric service in virginia at unbundled rates apco’s unbundled generation transmission which reflect ferc approved transmission rates and distribution rates as well as its functional separation plan were approved by the vscc in december 2001 apco’s base rates are capped at their mid1999 levels until the end of the transition period now december 31 2010 or sooner if the vscc finds that a competitive market for generation exists in virginia apco is permitted to seek two changes to its capped rates through december 31 2010 in addition apco is entitled to annual rate changes to recover the incremental costs it incurs for transmission and distribution reliability and compliance with state or federal environmental laws or regulations apco is entitled to adjustments to fuel rates through 2010 to recover its actual fuel costs the fuel component of its purchased power costs and certain capacity charges apco recovers its generation capacity charges through capped base rates in july 2005 apco filed a request with the vscc seeking approval to recover additional environmental and reliabilityrelated costs the request is currently pending before the vscc see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2005 annual reports for additional information on current rate proceedings 

west virginia  apco and wpco provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc while west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs an earlier rate proceeding for both apco and wpco resulted in the suspension of their operative fuel clause mechanisms though they continue to recover a fixed level of fuel costs through bundled rates in august 2005 apco and wpco collectively filed an application with the wvpsc seeking an increase in their retail rates and the reactivation of their suspended operative fuel clause and other recovery mechanisms that matter is currently pending before the wvpsc we have received approval from the wvpsc to begin deferral accounting associated with the fuel clause mechanism effective july 1 2006 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2005 annual reports for additional information on current rate proceedings 

other jurisdictions  the public utility subsidiaries of aep also provide service at regulated bundled rates in arkansas kentucky louisiana and tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in michigan 

the following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate

as a result of puhca’s repeal jurisdiction over certain holding company related activities has been transferred to the ferc specifically the ferc has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company in addition both ferc and state regulators will be permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system epact gives the ferc “backstop” transmission siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight 

electric restructuring and customer choice legislation 

certain states in aep’s service area have adopted restructuring or customer choice legislation in general this legislation provides for a transition from bundled costbased rate regulated electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service and market pricing for the supply of electricity with customer choice of supplier at a minimum this legislation allows retail customers to select alternative generation suppliers electric restructuring andor customer choice began on january 1 2001 in ohio and on january 1 2002 in michigan virginia and the ercot area of texas electric restructuring in the spp area of texas has been delayed by the puct until at least 2007 aep’s public utility subsidiaries operate in both the ercot and spp areas of texas 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled effects of regulation  included in the 2005 annual reports for a discussion of the effect of restructuring and customer choice legislation on accounting procedures see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring for additional information 

ohio restructuring 

the ohio act requires vertically integrated electric utility companies that offer competitive retail electric service in ohio to separate their generating functions from their transmission and distribution functions following the market development period which ended december 31 2005 retail customers receive distribution and where applicable transmission service from the incumbent utility whose distribution rates are approved by the puco and whose transmission rates are approved by the ferc the puco approved cspco’s and opco’s rate stabilization plans that among other things addressed default generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 see item 1  utility operations  regulation—ferc for a discussion of ferc regulation of transmission rates regulation—rates—ohio and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2005 annual reports  for a discussion of the impact of restructuring on distribution rates the puco authorized cspco and opco to remain functionally separated through the end of that threeyear period the puco’s order has been appealed to the supreme court of ohio by the ohio consumers counsel  

texas restructuring 

signed into law in june of 1999 the texas act substantially amended the regulatory structure governing electric utilities in texas in order to allow retail electric competition for all customers among other things the texas act 

 

 

 

the texas act provides each affected utility an opportunity to recover its generation related regulatory assets and stranded costs resulting from the legal separation of the transmission and distribution utility from the generation facilities and the related introduction of retail electric competition regulatory assets consist of the texas jurisdictional amount of generationrelated regulatory assets and liabilities in the audited financial statements as of december 31 1998 stranded costs consist of the positive excess of the net regulated book value of generation assets as of december 31 2001 over the market value of those assets taking specified factors into account as ultimately determined in a puct trueup proceeding 

in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application or trueup proceeding with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in february 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion other parties may appeal the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large we expect to appeal seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas act and related rules for a discussion of i regulatory assets and stranded costs subject to recovery by tcc and ii rate adjustments made after implementation of restructuring to allow recovery of certain costs by or with respect to tcc and tnc see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring included in the 2005 annual reports  

michigan customer choice 

customer choice commenced for im’s michigan customers on january 1 2002 rates for retail electric service for im’s michigan customers were unbundled though they continue to be regulated to allow customers the ability to evaluate the cost of generation service for comparison with other suppliers at december 31 2005 none of im’s michigan customers have elected to change suppliers and no alternative electric suppliers are registered to compete in im’s michigan service territory 

virginia restructuring 

in april 2004 the governor of virginia signed legislation that extends the transition period for electricity restructuring including capped rates through december 31 2010 the legislation provides specified cost recovery opportunities during the capped rate period including two optional general base rate changes and an opportunity for timely recovery through a separate rate mechanism of certain incremental environmental and reliability costs incurred on and after july 1 2004 

competition 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy in recent years have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with the various state commissions occasionally these rates are first negotiated and then filed with the state commissions the public utility subsidiaries believe that they are unlikely to be materially adversely affected by this competition 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations 

investments 

gas operations 

in january 2005 we sold a 98 controlling interest in hpl and related assets with the remaining 2 interest being sold to the buyer in november 2005 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments assets held for sale and other losses  included in the 2005 annual reports for more information as a result management anticipates that our gas marketing operations will be limited to managing our obligations with respect to the gas transactions entered into before these sales 

other 

general 

through certain subsidiaries aep conducts certain business operations other than those included in other segments in which it uses and manages a portfolio of energyrelated assets the assets currently used and managed include 

 

 

 

these operations include the following activities 

 

 

 

aep has in the past three years written down the value of certain of these investments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments assets held for sale and other losses included in the 2005 annual reports 

dow chemical cogeneration facility 

pursuant to an agreement with dow aep constructed a 880 mw cogeneration facility “facility” at dow’s chemical facility in plaquemine louisiana that achieved commercial operation status on march 18 2004 dow uses a portion of the energy produced by the facility and sells the excess power to us we have agreed to sell up to all of the excess 800 mw to tractebel at a price that is currently in excess of market tractebel alleged that the power purchase agreement was unenforceable this agreement is now being litigated a bench trial was conducted in march and april 2005 in august 2005 a federal judge ruled that tractebel had breached the contract and awarded us damages of 123 million plus prejudgment interest both parties have filed appeals in january 2006 the trial court increased aep’s judgment against tractebel to 173 million plus prejudgment interest the power from the facility is currently sold on the market see notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies and acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments assets held for sale and other losses  respectively included in the 2005 annual reports for more information 




 item 1a   risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

we may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions   applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits construction andor acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions if these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates we charge we would not be able to recover the costs associated with our planned extensive investment this would cause our financial results to be diminished while we may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of our capital investment there can no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments 

our planned capital investment program coincides with a material increase in the price of the fuels used to generate electricity many of our jurisdictions have fuel clauses that permit us to recover these increased fuel costs through rates without a general rate case while prudent capital investment and variable fuel costs each generally warrant recovery in practical terms our regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that we would recover through higher rates any such limitation could cause our financial results to be diminished 

our request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in virginia   applies to aep and apco 

on july 1 2005 apco filed a request with the vscc seeking approval for the recovery of 62 million in incremental costs through june 30 2006 the 62 million request included incurred and projected costs of environmental controls transmission costs including line construction and other system reliability work in october 2005 the vscc ruled that it does not have the authority to approve the recovery of projected costs in november 2005 apco filed supplemental testimony in which it updated the actual costs through september 2005 and reduced its requested recovery to 21 million the staff of the vscc has made filings to dismiss the transmission system reliability costs from consideration for recovery arguing that the ferc and not the vscc has jurisdiction over the unbundled transmission component of apcos retail rates through december 31 2005 apco has deferred 24 million of recorded costs that are subject to this proceeding which does not include 4 million of related equity carrying costs the staff of the vscc has issued testimony that would reduce apco’s recovery of current and future costs to 20 million if the vscc denies recovery of any of apco’s deferred costs it would adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

our request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in west virginia   applies to aep and apco 

in august 2005 apco and wpco collectively filed an application amended in january 2006 with the wvpsc seeking an initial increase in their retail base rates of approximately 73 million most of the requested base rate increase is attributable to reactivating the currently suspended enec mechanism that provides recovery of power supply costs including fuel and purchased power while the rest is primarily related to the recovery of the costs associated with the ceredo generating station and service reliability improvements the first supplemental increase of 9 million requested to be effective at the same time as the base rate change provides for recovery of the capital costs of the wyoming jacksons ferry 765kv line the remaining proposed supplemental increases are 43 million 8 million and 36 million to be effective on january 1 2007 2008 and 2009 respectively provide for recovery of environmental expenditures apco has a regulatory liability of 52 million of presuspension previously overrecovered enec costs which along with a carrying cost it is proposing to apply in the future to any future underrecoveries of enec costs through the reactivated enec mechanism the wvpsc has granted a joint motion that requested hearings begin april 17 2006 that new rates go into effect on july 28 2006 and that deferral accounting for over or underrecovery of the enec begin july 1 2006 if the wvpsc denies the requested rate recovery it could adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

our request for rate recovery of additional costs may not be approved in kentucky   applies to aep and kpco 

in september 2005 kpco filed a request with the kentucky public service commission to increase base rates by approximately 65 million to recover increasing costs the major components of the rate increase included a return on common equity of 115 or 26 million the recovery of transmission costs of 10 million the recovery of additional capacity costs of 9 million additional reliability spending of 7 million and increased depreciation expense of 5 million we have entered into a settlement agreement with intervenors that provides an increase in base rates of approximately 41 million if the kentucky public service commission does not approve the settlement or otherwise denies the requested rate recovery it could adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to recover all of our fuel costs in indiana applies to aep and im 

in 2003 im’s fuel and base rates in indiana were frozen through a prior agreement in 2004 the iurc ordered the continuation of the fixed fuel adjustment charge on an interim basis through march 2005 pending the outcome of negotiations certain of the parties to the negotiations reached a settlement the iurc approved the agreement on june 1 2005 the approved settlement caps fuel rates for the march 2004 through june 2007 billing months at increasing rates during agreedupon intervals im experienced a cumulative underrecovery of fuel costs for the period march 2004 through december 2005 if future fuel costs through june 30 2007 continue to exceed the agreedupon caps future results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

the rates that swepco may charge its customers may be reduced applies to swepco 

in october 2005 the staff of the puct reported results of its review of swepco’s yearend 2004 earnings based upon the staff’s adjustments to the information submitted by swepco the report indicates that swepco is receiving excess revenues of approximately 15 million the staff has engaged swepco in discussions to reconcile the earnings calculation and consider possible ways to address the results separately at the time of the csw merger swepco agreed to file with the lpsc detailed financial information typically utilized in a revenue requirement filing on a periodic basis in order to demonstrate the lack of adverse impact from the merger the first such filing was in october 2002 and the second was in april 2004 while both filings indicated that swepco’s rates should not be reduced direct testimony filed by staff of the lpsc recommends a 15 million reduction in swepco’s louisiana jurisdictional base rates swepco has filed rebuttal testimony and additional discovery is planned in a separate matter in november 2005 the lpsc included swepco in an inquiry initiated to determine whether utilities had purchased fuel and power at the lowest possible price and whether suppliers offered competitive prices for fuel and purchased power during the period of january 1 2005 through october 31 2005 as a result the lpsc is conducting an audit of swepco’s historical fuel costs for the years 2003 and 2004 at this time management is unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings if a rate reduction is ordered in the future it would adversely impact future results of operations and cash flows 

 

the amount that pso seeks to recover for fuel costs is currently being reviewed   applies to pso 

in 2002 pso experienced a 44 million underrecovery of fuel costs resulting from a reallocation among aep’s west zone public utility subsidiaries of purchased power costs for periods prior to january 1 2002 in july 2003 pso filed with the occ offering to collect the underrecovery over 18 months an intervenor the staff of the occ and the attorney general of oklahoma have made filings indicating that recovery should be reduced substantially or disallowed altogether these filings disputed the allocation of aep system offsystem sales margins pursuant to an agreement approved by ferc in september 2003 the occ expanded the case to include a full review of pso’s 2001 fuel and purchased power practices the allocation issue was referred to an alj the alj recommended that the occ lacks authority to examine whether pso deviated from the ferc allocation methodology and that any such complaints should be addressed at the ferc the occ conducted a hearing on the jurisdictional matter in january 2005 but has not issued a decision if the occ determines as a result of the review that a portion of pso’s fuel and purchased power costs should not be recovered there could be an adverse effect on pso’s results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition 

the internal allocation of aep system offsystem sales margins has been challenged applies to apco cspco im kpco and opco 

offsystem sales margins are allocated among the aep system companies pursuant to a fercapproved agreement among those companies entered into at the time of the merger with csw in november 2005 we filed with the ferc a proposed allocation methodology to be used in 2006 and beyond the original allocations have been challenged in different forums including pso’s fuel clause recovery proceeding before the occ in general the challenges assert that aep’s west zone public utility subsidiaries acquired in the merger with csw are being allocated a disproportionately small amount of the offsystem sales margins an alj in the occ proceeding and separately a federal district court in texas have each held that the ferc is the only appropriate adjudicator of such challenges no proceeding questioning the allocation of our offsystem sales is currently before the ferc the occ however has yet to rule on whether it has jurisdiction over this issue if the ferc or another entity of competent authority were to retroactively allocate additional offsystem sales margins to the west zone public utility subsidiaries the east zone public utility subsidiaries may be required to pay money to the west zone public utility subsidiaries any such payments could have an adverse effect on the results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition of the east zone public utility subsidiaries 

the base rates that certain of our utilities charge are currently capped or frozen applies to aep cspco im and opco 

base rates charged to customers in michigan and ohio are currently either frozen or capped to the extent our costs in these states exceed the applicable cap or frozen rate those costs are not recoverable from customers 

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

unless mitigated by timely and adequate regulatory recovery the cost of repairing damage to our utility facilities due to storms natural disasters wars terrorist acts and other catastrophic events in excess of insurance coverage when applicable may adversely impact our revenues operating and capital expenses and results of operations such events may also create additional risks related to the supply andor cost of equipment and materials 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep and im 

through im we own the cook plant it consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2143 mw or 6 of our generation capacity we are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that im’s preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if and when these risks are triggered 

the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit moreover a major incident at a nuclear facility in the us could require us to make material contributory payments 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing transmission regulatory structures which could affect our performance in these regions applies to each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets problems or delays that may arise in the operation of new regional transmission organizations or “rtos” may restrict our ability to sell power produced by our generating capacity to certain markets if there is insufficient transmission capacity otherwise available the rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional power markets or the manner in which rtos will evolve or the regions they will cover we are unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets may have on our business 

aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries joined pjm on october 1 2004 swepco and pso are members of spp in february 2004 ferc granted rto status to spp subject to fulfilling specified requirements in october 2004 the ferc issued an order granting final rto status to spp subject to certain filings 

the utility commissions of louisiana and arkansas are concerned about the effect on retail ratepayers of utilities in louisiana and arkansas joining rtos these commissions have ordered the utilities in those states including us to analyze and submit to them the costs and benefits of rto options available to the utilities certain states in the region have undertaken and released a study investigating the costs and benefits of spp developing into a rto that administers energy and associated markets 

to the extent we are faced with conflicting state and federal requirements as to our participation in rtos it could adversely affect our ability to operate and recover transmission costs from retail customers management is unable to predict the outcome of these transmission regulatory actions and proceedings or their impact on the timing and operation of rtos our transmission operations or future results of operations and cash flows 

the amount we charge third parties for using our transmission facilities may be reduced and not recovered   applies to aep and aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries  

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and the miso to make compliance filings for their respective oatts to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within the proposed miso and pjm expanded regions combined footprint the elimination of the to rates reduces the transmission service revenues collected by the rtos and thereby reduces the revenues received by transmission owners under the rtos’ revenue distribution protocols to mitigate the impact of lost to revenues the ferc approved temporary replacement seams elimination cost adjustment seca transition rates beginning in december 2004 and extending through march 2006 intervenors objected to this decision and seca fees are being collected subject to refund while ferc considers the issue 

seca transition rates have not fully compensated aep for lost to revenues  aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries received approximately 1 96 million of to rate revenues for the twelve months ended september 30 2004 the last twelve months prior to joining pjm aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries recognized net seca revenues of 128 million in 2005 seca transition rates expire at the end of march 2006 after which all transmission costs that would otherwise have been covered by to rates in the combined footprint will be subject to recovery from native load customers of aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries  a rate request is pending in west virginia and a settlement agreement is pending in kentucky that address the reduction in these transmission revenues in february 2006 cspco and opco filed with the puco to increase their transmission rates to reflect the loss of their share of seca revenues at this time management is unable to predict whether any resultant increase in rates applicable to aep’s internal load will be recoverable on a timely basis from state retail customers 

in addition to seeking retail rate recovery from the applicable states aep and another member of pjm have filed an application with the ferc seeking compensation from other unaffiliated members of pjm for the costs associated with those members’ use of our respective transmission assets a majority of pjm members have filed in opposition to the proposal the case is scheduled for hearing in april 2006 aep management cannot at this time estimate the outcome of the proceeding 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of costs   applies to each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time additionally there may also be a delay between the timing of when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered while rate regulation is premised on providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of our costs in a timely manner 

we operate in a nonuniform and fluid regulatory environment applies to each registrant 

in addition to the multiple levels of state regulation at the states in which we operate our business is subject to extensive federal regulation there can be no assurance that 1 the federal legislative and regulatory initiatives which have occurred over the past few years and which have generally facilitated competition in the energy sector will continue or will not be reversed or 2 state regulation will not become significantly more restrictive further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate will impact the effectiveness of our business plan and may because of the continued uncertainty harm our financial condition and results of operations 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity  applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforeseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power from the market we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers because some of the states we operate in do not allow us to increase our rates in response to increased fuel cost charges since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage were brief we could suffer substantial losses that could reduce our results of operations 

risks related to market economic or financial volatility 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses applies to each registrant other than aegco 

following the bankruptcy of enron the credit ratings agencies initiated a thorough review of the capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings of energy companies including us the agencies revised ratings at that time further negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

if moody’s or sp were to downgrade the longterm rating of any of the registrants  particularly below investment grade the borrowing costs of that registrant would increase which would diminish its financial results in addition the registrant’s potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

aep has no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other obligations due it from its subsidiaries applies to aep 

aep is a holding company and has no operations of its own its ability to meet its financial obligations associated with its indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its operating subsidiaries primarily its regulated utilities and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from aep its subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from aep to provide aep with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments payments to aep by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations in addition any payment of dividends distributions or advances by the utility subsidiaries to aep would be subject to regulatory or contractual restrictions 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis  applies to each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder we expect that unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase aep’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable 

parties we have engaged to provide construction materials or services may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the installation of environmental upgrades construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities as well as other initiatives as a result we have engaged numerous contractors and entered into a large number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials andor obtain the required construction related services we are therefore exposed to the risk that these contractors and other counterparties could breach their obligations to us should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and almost certainly cause delays in that and related projects although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty our actual exposure may be greater than these mitigation provisions this would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses or delays in completing construction 

changes in commodity prices may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance  applies to each registrant 

we are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts similarly we are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances we use emission allowances in direct proportion with the amount of coal we use as fuel according to our estimates we have procured sufficient emission allowances to cover our projected needs for the next two years and for much of the projected needs for periods beyond that at some point however we will have to obtain additional allowances and those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those currently obtained 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to the more volatile market prices of natural gas 

the price trends for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material increases that are expected to continue changes in the cost of coal emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal emission allowances or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers in addition the prices we can charge our retail customers in some jurisdictions are capped and our fuel recovery mechanisms in other states are frozen for various periods of time 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

in certain jurisdictions we have limited ability to pass on our fuel costs to our customers applies to aep apco cspco im and opco 

we are exposed to risk from changes in the market prices of coal natural gas and emissions used to generate power where generation is no longer regulated or where existing fuel clauses are suspended or frozen the prices of coal natural gas and emissions have increased materially over the past several years and that trend is expected to continue the protection afforded by retail fuel clause recovery mechanisms has been eliminated by the implementation of customer choice in ohio because the risk of generating costs cannot be passed through to customers as a matter of right in ohio we retain these risks 

we have applied to reactivate the mechanism that provides recovery of power supply costs including fuel in west virginia the mechanism was suspended by a settlement reached in a state restructuring proceeding the wvpsc has approved commencement of deferral accounting related to power supply costs including fuel effective july 1 2006 a recently negotiated fuel cap in indiana may not allow us to fully recover our fuel costs there if we cannot recover an amount sufficient to cover our actual fuel costs our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

we are exposed to losses resulting from the bankruptcy of enron corp applies to aep 

on june 1 2001 we purchased houston pipe line company “hpl” from enron corp “enron” later that year enron and its subsidiaries filed bankruptcy proceedings in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york various hpl related contingencies and indemnities from enron remained unsettled at the date of enron’s bankruptcy in connection with the 2001 acquisition of hpl we entered into an agreement with bam lease company which granted hpl the exclusive right to use approximately 65 bcf of cushion gas required for the normal operation of the bammel gas storage facility at the time of our acquisition of hpl bank of america “boa” and certain other banks together with boa “boa syndicate” and enron entered into an agreement granting hpl the exclusive use of 65 bcf of cushion gas additionally enron and the boa syndicate released hpl from all prior and future liabilities and obligations in connection with the financing arrangement after the enron bankruptcy hpl was informed by the boa syndicate of a purported default by enron under the terms of the financing arrangement we are currently litigating the rights to the cushion gas 

in february 2004 in connection with boa’s dispute enron filed notices of rejection regarding the cushion gas use agreement and other incidental agreements we have objected to enron’s attempted rejection of these agreements in 2005 we sold hpl including the bammel gas storage facility we indemnified the purchaser for damages if any arising from the litigation with boa management is unable to predict the final resolution of these disputes however the impact on results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be material 

risks relating to state restructuring 

we may be required to serve former large industrial or commercial customers in ohio at rates that are below market applies to aep cspco and opco 

large industrial or commercial customers in ohio who switched from us to alternative suppliers when customer choice became effective may successfully petition the puco to require us to provide service to them at prices that may be below market or that do not allow us to recover our costs this may increase demand above our facilities’ available capacity or limit our ability to earn a return on the sale of power thus any such switching by customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position additionally to the extent the power sold to meet the default service obligations could have been sold to third parties at more favorable wholesale prices we will have incurred potentially significant lost opportunity costs 

some laws and regulations governing restructuring in virginia have not yet been interpreted or adopted and could harm our business operating results and financial condition applies to aep and apco 

virginia restructuring legislation was enacted in 1999 providing for retail choice of generation suppliers to be phased in over two years beginning january 1 2002 it required jurisdictional utilities to unbundle their power supply and energy delivery rates and to file functional separation plans by january 1 2002 apco filed its plan with the vscc and following vscc approval of a settlement agreement now operates in virginia as a functionally separated electric utility charging unbundled rates for its retail sales of electricity the settlement agreement addressed functional separation leaving decisions related to legal separation for later vscc consideration while the electric restructuring law in virginia established the general framework governing the retail electric market it required the vscc to issue rules and determinations implementing the law some of the regulations governing the retail electric market have not yet been adopted by the vscc when the regulations are developed and adopted compliance with them may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

there is uncertainty as to our recovery of stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in texas applies to aep and tcc 

restructuring legislation in texas required utilities with stranded costs to use marketbased methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs we elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of the generation assets of tcc for stranded cost purposes in general terms the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology is the amount by which the book value of generating assets including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized exceeds the market value of the generation assets as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets in may 2005 tcc filed its stranded cost quantification application with the puct seeking recovery of 24 billion of net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items a final order was issued in february 2006 in the final order the puct determined tcc’s net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items to be approximately 1475 billion other parties may appeal the puct’s final order as unwarranted or too large we expect to appeal seeking additional recovery consistent with the texas act and related rules if after appeal the amount of recovery is reduced or we are otherwise unable to recover all or part of the net stranded generation costs and other recoverable trueup items it could have a material adverse effect on results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps   applies to aep tcc and tnc 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately sixty reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the new texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows and thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

risks related to owning and operating generation assets and selling power 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could harm our cash flow and profitability applies to each registrant other than tcc 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future costs of compliance with environmental regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase all of our estimates are subject to significant uncertainties about the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables including timing of implementation required levels of reductions allocation requirements of the new rules and our selected compliance alternatives as a result we cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty the actual costs to comply could differ significantly from the estimates all of the costs are incremental to our current investment base and operating cost structure 

governmental authorities may assess penalties on us if it is determined that we have not complied with environmental laws and regulations   applies to each registrant other than tcc 

if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations even if caused by factors beyond our control that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us recent lawsuits by the epa and various states filed against us highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities in general and coalfired generating facilities in particular 

since 1999 we have been involved in litigation regarding generating plant emissions under the clean air act epa and a number of states alleged that we and other unaffiliated utilities modified certain units at coalfired generating plants in violation of the clean air act epa filed complaints against certain aep subsidiaries in us district court for the southern district of ohio a separate lawsuit initiated by certain special interest groups was consolidated with the epa case the alleged modification of the generating units occurred over a 20year period a bench trial on the liability issues was held during july 2005 briefing has concluded but no decision has been issued additionally in july 2004 attorneys general of eight states and others sued aep and other utilities alleging that carbon dioxide emissions from power generating facilities constitute a public nuisance under federal common law the suits were dismissed by the trial court and plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal while we believe the claims are without merit the costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide emissions could harm our business and our results of operations and financial position 

if these or other future actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants could be required in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay penalties andor halt operations moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

our revenues and results of operations from selling power are subject to market risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant other than tcc 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market or other competitive power markets or on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions we are generally not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time trading margins may erode as markets mature and there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as rtos that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets fuel and emissions prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel andor emissions costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 

volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our power trading including coal gas and e mission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities applies to each registrant other than tcc 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we attempt to manage our exposure by establishing and enforcing of risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within guidelines we set resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be inaccurate 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our pooled electric generating facilities successfully applies to each registrant other than tcc 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities operating electric generating facilities involves many risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

a decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we are contractually required to operate a power generation facility that may indirectly force us to sell the facility’s excess energy at a loss applies to aep 

we have agreed to lease from juniper capital lp a nonregulated merchant power generation facility “facility” near plaquemine louisiana we sublease the facility to dow we operate the facility for dow dow uses a portion of the energy produced by the facility and sells the excess power to us we have agreed to sell up to all of the excess 800 mw to tractebel at a price that is currently in excess of market tractebel alleged that the power purchase agreement was unenforceable this agreement is now being litigated a bench trial was conducted in march and april 2005 in august 2005 a federal judge ruled that tractebel had breached the contract and awarded us damages of 123 million plus prejudgment interest both parties have filed appeals in january 2006 the trial court increased aep’s judgment against tractebel to 173 million plus prejudgment interest if the trial award is reversed or if tractebel does not pay the judgment our cash flow will be adversely affected if the power agreement is held to be unenforceable we will be required to find new purchasers for up to 800 mw there can be no assurance that the power produced will be sold at prices that will exceed our costs to produce it if that were the case as a result of our obligations to dow we would be required to operate the facility at a loss   

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power applies to each registrant other than tcc 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities applies to each registrant other than tcc 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market

cook nuclear plant 

the following table provides operating information relating to the cook plant 

 

 

 

 

costs associated with the operation excluding fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities im may also incur costs and experience reduced output at cook plant because of the design criteria prevailing at the time of construction and the age of the plant’s systems and equipment nuclear industrywide and cook plant initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and maintenance costs at these plants however the ability of im to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant is not assured such costs may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs 

transmission and distribution facilities 

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the aep system and its operating companies and that portion of the total representing 765kv lines 

 

 

 

titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

substantially all the fixed physical properties and franchises of apco and swepco except for limited exceptions are subject to the lien of the mortgage and deed of trust securing the first mortgage bonds of each such company 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

general 

with input from its state utility commissions the aep system continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate aep forecasts 37 billion 36 billion and 35 billion of construction expenditures for 2006 2007 and 2008 respectively estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital   

proposed transmission facilities 

aep has filed a proposal with the ferc and the pjm to build a new 765kv transmission line stretching from west virginia to new jersey the proposed transmission corridor will span approximately 550 miles and is designed to reduce pjm congestion costs through enhancing transfer capability and also to reduce transmission line losses it also is expected to improve reliability in the eastern transmission grid aep´s proposed transmission line called the aep interstate project would originate at aep´s amos transmission station in putnam county wv connect through doubs station in frederick county md and terminate at the deans station in middlesex county nj the proposed route follows a corridor conceptually identified by pjm as a transmission route needed to address transmission congestion within the pjm footprint exact routing of the line would be determined after pjm approves the project aep will work with pjm other affected transmission owners and stakeholders throughout the siting process aep also has filed with the doe in its efforts to designate national interest electric transmission corridors nietc epact provides for nietc designation for areas that are experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers it is expected that a new aep subsidiary aep transmission co llc will own the line and undertake construction of the project the projected costs are approximately 3 billion which may be shared with other stakeholders the anticipated inservice date is 2014 assuming three years to site and acquire rightsofway and five years to build the line 

apco is continuing construction of the jacksons ferrywyoming 765 kv transmission line the wvpsc and the vscc have issued certificates authorizing construction and operation of the line on december 31 2002 the us forest service issued a final environmental impact statement and record of decision to allow the use of federal lands in the jefferson national forest for construction of a portion of the line on may 11 2004 the decision of the forest service was challenged by the sierra club in the united states district court for the western district of virginia apco has intervened in that litigation  construction of the line is underway and the project is scheduled to be completed by june 2006 

proposed generation facilities 

in conjunction with an environmental impact study issued in august 2004 we announced plans to construct a syntheticgasfired plant or plants of approximately 1000 mw of capacity in the next five to six years utilizing integrated gasification combined cycle igcc technology we estimate that this new plant or plants will cost up to approximately 12 billion of direct costs for a nominal 600 mw facility we are currently performing site analysis and evaluation and at the same time working with state regulators and legislators to establish a framework for expedient recovery of this significant investment in new clean coal technology before final site selection 

the plans are contingent upon receiving adequate cost recovery through rates approved by the applicable commission prior to beginning construction we have filed an application in west virginia seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct an igcc plant in new haven west virginia in ohio we filed an application with the puco requesting the approval of a mechanism by which costs associated with constructing and operating an igcc throughout the life of the facility can be recovered in rates authorized by the puco we have also entered into an agreement with general electric company and bechtel power corporation pursuant to which they are providing frontend engineering and design for a nominal 600 mw igcc facility 

our significant planned environmental investments in emission control installations at existing coalfired plants and our commitment to igcc technology reinforce our belief that coal will be a loweremission domestic energy source of the future and further signals our commitment to investing in clean environmentally safe technology for additional information regarding anticipated environmental expenditures see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters  

in the fourth quarter of 2005 pso and swepco each issued requests for proposals rfps soliciting capacity and energy resource proposals to satisfy their customers’ future electric power requirements swepco is seeking up to 500 mw of shortterm peaking capacity and up to 1600 mw of longterm generating resources comprised of peaking intermediate and baseload generation by 2011 pso is seeking 300 mw of shortterm peaking resources by june 2008 and 600 of baseload generation by june 2011 in december 2005 pso received four proposals totaling more than 1100 mw although one proposal was rejected for not conforming to bidding requirements the remaining proposals which are selfbuild options continue to be evaluated swepco and pso anticipate submitting selfbuild proposals in their respective rfps processes pso received proposals in its base load rfp on february 16 2006 totaling 3500 mw including three selfbuild proposals and three nonaffiliate proposals the rfps are currently being evaluated 

construction expenditures 

the following table shows construction expenditures including environmental expenditures during 2003 2004 and 2005 and current estimates of 2006 2007 and 2008 construction expenditures in each case excluding afudc and assets acquired under leases 

 

 

 

 

the system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand business and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital environmental requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules and costs and in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities as well as variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal income and other taxes and other factors affecting cash requirements may increase or decrease the estimated capital requirements for the system’s construction program 

potential uninsured losses 

some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to the cook plant and costs of replacement power in the event of a nuclear incident at the cook plant unless allowed to be recovered through rates future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep im and other aep system companies see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies for information with respect to nuclear incident liability insurance

risk factors 

general risks of our regulated operations 

rate regulation may delay or deny full recovery of costs applies to each registrant 

our public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions these rates are generally regulated based on an analysis of the applicable utility’s expenses incurred in a test year thus the rates a utility is allowed to charge may or may not match its expenses at any given time while rate regulation is premised on providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of our costs 

the rates that certain of our utilities may charge their customers may be reduced applies to aep and pso swepco and tcc respectively 

in february 2003 the occ required pso to file all documents necessary for a general rate review in october 2003 and june 2004 pso filed financial information and supporting testimony in response to the occ’s requirements indicating that its annual revenues were 41 million less than costs the occ staff and intervenors filed testimony regarding their recommendations of a decrease in annual existing rates between 15 and 36 million in addition one party recommended that 30 million of pso’s natural gas costs not be recovered from customers because it failed to implement a procurement strategy that this party alleged would have resulted in lower natural gas costs pso filed rebuttal testimony in february 2005which indicated a decrease of pso’s revenue deficiency from 41 million to 28 million although much of that decrease includes items that would be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause rather than through base rates hearings are scheduled to begin in march 2005 and a final decision is not expected any earlier than the second quarter of 2005 management is unable to predict the ultimate effect of these proceedings on pso’s revenues results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in october 2002 swepco filed with the lpsc detailed financial information typically utilized in a revenue requirement filing including a jurisdictional cost of service this filing was required by the lpsc as a result of its order approving the merger between aep and central and south west corporation “csw” the lpsc’s merger order also provides that swepco’s base rates are capped at the present level through mid2005 in april 2004 swepco filed updated financial information with a test year ending december 31 2003 as required by the lpsc both filings indicated that swepco’s current rates should not be reduced subsequently direct testimony was filed on behalf of the lpsc recommending a 15 million reduction in swepco’s louisiana jurisdictional base rates at this time management is unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding if a rate reduction is ordered in the future it would adversely impact swepco’s future results of operations and cash flows 

on june 26 2003 the city of mcallen texas requested that tcc provide justification showing that its transmission and distribution rates should not be reduced other municipalities served by tcc passed similar rate review resolutions tcc filed the requested support for its rates based on a test year ending june 30 2003 with all of its municipalities and the puct in february 2004 eight intervening parties and the puct staff filed testimony recommending reductions to tcc’s requested 67 million rate increase the recommendations ranged from a decrease in existing rates of approximately 100 million to an increase in tcc’s current rates of approximately 27 million the aljs issued recommendations in november 2004 which would reduce tcc’s existing rates by 51 million to 78 million from existing levels the puct will hold additional hearings on two major issues in march 2005 the puct is expected to issue a decision in the first half of 2005 if the puct orders a rate reduction it could adversely impact tcc’s future results of operations and cash flows 

the amount that pso seeks to recover for fuel costs is currently being reviewed   applies to pso 

in 2002 pso experienced a 44 million underrecovery of fuel costs resulting from a reallocation among aep’s west zone public utility subsidiaries of purchased power costs for periods prior to january 1 2002 in september 2003 the occ expanded the case to include a full review of pso’s 2001 fuel and purchased power practices pso filed testimony in february 2004 an intervenor the occ staff filed testimony and the attorney general of oklahoma have made filings indicating that recovery should be disallowed altogether or reduced in the range of 18 million to 9 million these filings raised certain issues of an allocation approved under ferc the alj recommended that the occ lacks authority to examine whether pso deviated from the ferc allocation methodology and that any such complaints should be addressed at the ferc the occ conducted a hearing on the jurisdictional matter in january 2005 but has not issued a decision if the occ determines as a result of the review that a portion of pso’s fuel and purchased power costs should not be recovered there could be an adverse effect on pso’s results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition 

the base rates that certain of our utilities charge are currently capped or frozen applies to aep cspco im opco and swepco 

base rates charged to customers in indiana michigan louisiana and ohio are currently either frozen or capped to the extent our costs in these states exceed the applicable cap or frozen rate those costs are not recoverable from customers 

certain of our revenues and results of operations are subject to risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

unless mitigated by timely and adequate regulatory recovery the cost of repairing damage to our utility facilities due to storms natural disasters wars terrorist acts and other catastrophic events in excess of reserves established for such repairs may adversely impact our revenues operating and capital expenses and results of operations 

we are exposed to nuclear generation risk applies to aep im and tcc 

through im and tcc we have interests in four nuclear generating units which interests equal 2740 mw or 7 of our generation capacity tcc has entered an agreement to sell its interest in two nuclear generating units we are therefore also subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following 















the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities in the event of noncompliance the nrc has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants such as ours in addition although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants if an incident did occur it could harm our results of operations or financial condition a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 

the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing transmission regulatory structures which could affect our performance in these regions applies to each registrant 

our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets problems or delays that may arise in the formation and operation of new regional transmission organizations or “rtos” may restrict our ability to sell power produced by our generating capacity to certain markets if there is insufficient transmission capacity otherwise available the rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues because it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional power markets or how rtos will develop or what regions they will cover we are unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets may have on our business 

aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries joined pjm on october 1 2004 two of aep’s west zone public utility subsidiaries are members of spp in february 2004 ferc granted rto status to the spp subject to fulfilling specified requirements in october 2004 the ferc issued an order granting final rto status to spp subject to certain filings 

the louisiana and arkansas commissions are concerned about the effect on retail ratepayers of utilities in louisiana and arkansas joining rtos the commissions have ordered the utilities in those states including us to analyze and submit to the commissions the costs and benefits of rto options available to the utilities the louisiana commission has also determined that certain rto structures that contemplate legally transferring transmission assets to it are presumptively not in the public interest 

to the extent we are faced with conflicting state and federal requirements as to our participation in rtos it could adversely affect our ability to operate and recover transmission costs from retail customers management is unable to predict the outcome of these transmission regulatory actions and proceedings or their impact on the timing and operation of rtos our transmission operations or future results of operations and cash flows 

the ferc may reduce the amount we may charge third parties for using our transmission facilities   applies to aep and aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries  

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and the miso to make compliance filings for their respective oatts to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within the proposed midwest iso and pjm expanded regions combined footprint the elimination of the to rates will reduce the transmission service revenues collected by the rtos and thereby reduce the revenues received by transmission owners under the rtos’ revenue distribution protocols 

aep and several other utilities in the combined footprint filed a proposal for new rates to become effective december 1 2004 in november 2004 ferc eliminated the to rates and replaced the rates temporarily through march 2006 with seams elimination cost adjustment seca fees aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries received approximately 1 96 million of to rate revenues for the twelve months ended september 30 2004 the last twelve months prior to joining pjm the portion of those revenues associated with transactions for which the to rate is being eliminated and replaced by seca fees was 171 million effective april 2006 all transmission costs that would otherwise have been defrayed by to rates in the combined footprint will be subject to recovery from native load customers of aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries at this time management is unable to predict whether any resultant increase in rates applicable to aep’s internal load will be recoverable on a timely basis from state retail customers unless new replacement rates compensate aep for its lost revenues and unless any increase in aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries’ transmission expenses from these new rates are fully recovered in retail rates on a timely basis future results of operations cash flows and financial condition will be adversely affected 

we are subject to regulation under the public utility holding company act of 1935 applies to each registrant 

our system is subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under puhca the rules and regulations under puhca impose a number of restrictions on the operations of registered holding company systems these restrictions include a requirement that the sec approve in advance securities issuances sales and acquisitions of utility assets sales and acquisitions of securities of utility companies and acquisitions of other businesses puhca also generally limits the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system plus additional energyrelated businesses puhca rules limit the dividends that our subsidiaries may pay from unearned surplus 

our merger with csw may ultimately be found to violate puhca applies to aep pso swepco tcc and tnc 

we acquired csw in a merger completed on june 15 2000 among the more significant assets we acquired as a result of the merger were four additional domestic electric utility companies  pso swepco tcc and tnc on january 18 2002 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that the sec’s june 14 2000 order approving the merger failed to properly find that the merger meets the requirements of puhca and sent the case back to the sec for further review specifically the court told the sec to revisit its conclusion that the merger met puhca’s requirement that the electric utilities be “physically interconnected” and confined to a “single area or region” in august 2004 the sec announced it would conduct hearings on this issue a hearing was held january 10 2005 before an alj an initial decision is expected from the alj later this year the sec will have the opportunity to review the initial decision 

we believe that the merger meets the requirements of puhca and expect the matter to be resolved favorably we can give no assurance however that i the sec or any applicable court review will find that the merger complies with puhca or ii the sec or any applicable court review will not impose material adverse conditions on us in order to find that the merger complies with puhca if the merger were ultimately found to violate puhca we could be required to take remedial actions or divest assets which could harm our results of operations or financial condition 

we operate in a nonuniform and fluid regulatory environment applies to each registrant 

in most instances and in varying degrees the rates charged by the domestic utility subsidiaries are approved by the ferc and the eleven state utility commissions ferc regulates wholesale electricity operations and transmission rates and the state commissions regulate retail generation and distribution rates several of the eleven state retail jurisdictions in which our domestic electric utilities operate have enacted restructuring legislation restructuring legislation in texas requires the legal separation of generation and related assets from the transmission and distribution assets of the electric utilities in that state in ohio we are complying with restructuring legislation through the continued functional separation of the operations of our ohio utility subsidiaries as a result of restructuring legislation in texas and ohio a significant portion of our domestic generation is no longer directly regulated by state utility commissions as to rates tcc has sold some of its generation in texas and is in the process of selling its remaining generation our utility operations in the remaining state retail jurisdictions that have not enacted any restructuring legislation currently plan to adhere to the verticallyintegrated utility model with cost recovery through regulated rates 

our business plan is based on the regulatory framework as described there can be no assurance that the states that have pursued restructuring will not reverse such policies nor can there be assurance that the states that have not enacted restructuring legislation will not do so in the future in addition to the multiple levels of regulation at the state level in which we operate our business is subject to extensive federal regulation there can be no assurance that the federal legislative and regulatory initiatives which have occurred over the past few years and which have generally facilitated competition in the energy sector will continue or will not be reversed 

further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate will impact the effectiveness of our business plan and may because of the continued uncertainty harm our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to market economic or international financial volatility 

downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital andor to operate our power trading businesses applies to each registrant other than aegco 

following the bankruptcy of enron the credit ratings agencies initiated a thorough review of the capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings of energy companies including us the agencies made ratings changes at that time further negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations our business is capital intensive and we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase and our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

moody’s has assigned an investment grade credit rating to the senior unsecured longterm debt of each registrant other than aegco collectively the “rated issuers” moody’s has further assigned an outlook of stable for each of the rated issuers other than aep which moody’s assigned an outlook of positive in 2004 sp has also assigned an investment grade credit rating to the senior unsecured longterm debt of each of the rated issuers sp has assigned an outlook of stable for each of the rated issuers fitch has also assigned an investment grade credit rating with stable outlook to the senior unsecured longterm debt of each of the rated issuers apart from moody’s improving the outlook on aep noted above none of these ratings was adjusted by any rating agency during 2004 

moody’s has assigned aep a shortterm debt rating of p3 sp has assigned aep a shortterm debt rating of a2 fitch has assigned aep a shortterm debt rating of f2 as a result of the split rating aep’s access to the commercial paper market may be limited and the shortterm borrowing costs of each registrant may increase because aep’s subsidiaries conduct shortterm borrowing through aep and on the same terms available to aep 

if moody’s or sp were to downgrade the longterm rating of any of the rated issuers  particularly below investment grade the borrowing costs of that rated issuer would increase which would diminish its financial results in addition it would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 

our power trading business relies on the investment grade ratings of our individual public utility subsidiaries’ senior unsecured longterm debt most of our counterparties require the creditworthiness of an investment grade entity to stand behind transactions if those ratings were to decline below investment grade our ability to operate our power trading business profitably would be diminished because we would likely have to deposit cash or cashrelated instruments which would reduce our profits 

the underfunded condition of our retirement plans may require additional significant contributions applies to each registrant 

aep provides defined benefit pension plans “pension plans” for the employees of our subsidiaries in addition aep provides health care and life insurance benefit plans for retired employees 

low prevailing interest rates have increased the pension plans’ liability the combined pension plans’ liabilities based on service and pay to date “accumulated benefit obligation” exceeded the value of the assets at december 31 2004 as of december 31 2004 the fair value of the pension plans assets was 356 billion while the accumulated benefit obligation was estimated at 40 billion an underfunding of approximately 450 million for the individual pension plans that were underfunded based on the accumulated benefit obligation underfunding totaled approximately 474 million in order to fund the qualified pension plans fully by the end of 2005 a discretionary contribution of 200 million was made in the fourth quarter of 2004 and discretionary contributions of 100 million per quarter are expected in 2005 

aep also made contributions of 137 million to postretirement health care and life insurance benefits trust funds in 2004 and expects to contribute significant amounts in the future 

we cannot predict the future performance of the investment markets a downturn in the investment markets could have a material negative impact on the net asset value of the plans’ trust accounts and increase the underfunding of the pension plans net of benefit obligations this may necessitate significant cash contributions to the pension plans changes in interest rates may also materially affect the pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit liabilities and the cash contributions needed to fund those liabilities changes in the laws and regulations governing the plans may increase or decrease the required contributions 

our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis  applies to each registrant 

electric power generation is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter as a result our overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the terms of power sale contracts that we enter into in addition we have historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder we expect that unusually mild weather in the future could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 

changes in technology may significantly affect our business by making our power plants less competitive  applies to each registrant 

a key element of our business model is that generating power at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at relatively low cost there are other technologies that produce power most notably fuel cells microturbines windmills and photovoltaic solar cells it is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central power station electric production if this were to happen and if these technologies achieved economies of scale our market share could be eroded and the value of our power plants could be reduced changes in technology could also alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy power thereby harming our financial results 

changes in commodity prices may increase our cost of producing power or decrease the amount we receive from selling power harming our financial performance  applies to each registrant 

we are heavily exposed to changes in the price and availability of coal because most of our generating capacity is coalfired we have contracts of varying durations for the supply of coal for most of our existing generation capacity but as these contracts end or otherwise not honored we may not be able to purchase coal on terms as favorable as the current contracts 

we also own natural gasfired facilities which increases our exposure to the more volatile market prices of natural gas 

changes in the cost of coal or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results since the prices we obtain for power may not change at the same rate as the change in coal or natural gas costs we may be unable to pass on the changes in costs to our customers in addition the prices we can charge our retail customers in some jurisdictions are capped and our fuel recovery mechanisms in other states are frozen for various periods of time 

in addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value our trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material as a result our financial results may be diminished in the future as those transactions are marked to market 

at times demand for power could exceed our supply capacity  applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

we are currently obligated to supply power in parts of eleven states from time to time because of unforseen circumstances the demand for power required to meet these obligations could exceed our available generation capacity if this occurs we would have to buy power on the market we may not always have the ability to pass these costs on to our customers because some of the states we operate in do not allow us to increase our rates in response to increased fuel cost charges since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand it is possible that the market price for power at that time would be very high even if a supply shortage was brief we could suffer substantial losses that could diminish our results of operations 

risks relating to state restructuring 

we have limited ability to pass our costs of production on to our customers applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to risk from changes in the market prices of coal and natural gas used to generate power where generation is no longer regulated or where existing fuel clauses are suspended or frozen recently the price of coal and natural gas has increased materially the protection afforded by retail fuel clause recovery mechanisms has been eliminated by the implementation of customer choice in ohio and in the ercot area of texas there may be similar risks should customer choice be similarly implemented in other states because the risk of generating costs cannot be passed through to customers as a matter of right in ohio and the ercot area of texas we retain these risks 

a fuel clause in west virginia has been suspended per a settlement reached in a state restructuring proceeding however as restructuring has not been implemented in west virginia the fuel clause may be reactivated an extension of the currently pending fuel clause in indiana is being negotiated 

our default service obligations in ohio do not restrict customers from switching suppliers of power applies to aep cspco and opco 

those default service customers that we serve in ohio may choose to purchase power from alternative suppliers should they choose to switch from us our sales of power may decrease customers originally choosing alternative suppliers may switch to our default service obligations this may increase demand above our facilities’ available capacity thus any such switching by customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position conversely to the extent the power sold to meet the default service obligations could have been sold to third parties at more favorable wholesale prices we will have incurred potentially significant lost opportunity costs 

if cspco and opco are unable to remain functionally separated they will need sec approval to legally separate their assets applies to cspco and opco 

ohio has enacted restructuring legislation in the ohio act cspco and opco each currently comply with the ohio act as a functionally separated electric utility the puco has approved the rate stabilization plan that does not contemplate legal separation at least through 2008 however we can give no assurance that we can remain functionally separated following that if cspco and opco are unable to remain functionally separated and we are required to legally separate they would need sec approval to legally separate 

some laws and regulations governing restructuring of the wholesale generation market in michigan and virginia have not yet been interpreted or adopted and could harm our business operating results and financial condition applies to aep and apco and im respectively 

while the electric restructuring laws in michigan and virginia established the general framework governing the retail electric market the laws required the utility commission in each state to issue rules and determinations implementing the laws some of the regulations governing the retail electric market have not yet been adopted by the utility commission in each state these laws when they are interpreted and when the regulations are developed and adopted may harm our business results of operations and financial condition virginia restructuring legislation was enacted in 1999 providing for retail choice of generation suppliers to be phased in over two years beginning january 1 2002 it required jurisdictional utilities to unbundle their power supply and energy delivery rates and to file functional separation plans by january 1 2002 apco filed its plan with vscc and following vscc approval of a settlement agreement now operates in virginia as a functionally separated electric utility charging unbundled rates for its retail sales of electricity the settlement agreement addressed functional separation leaving decisions related to legal separation for later vscc consideration legislation in virginia has been adopted which extends a cap on electricity rates until 2010   

customer choice commenced for im’s michigan customers on january 1 2002 rates for retail electric service for im’s michigan customers were unbundled though they continue to be regulated to allow customers the ability to evaluate the cost of generation service for comparison with other suppliers at december 31 2004 none of im’s michigan customers have elected to change suppliers and no alternative electric suppliers are registered to compete in im’s michigan service territory   

there is uncertainty as to our recovery of deferred fuel balances and stranded costs resulting from industry restructuring in texas applies to aep and tcc 

in 2002 tcc filed its final fuel reconciliation with the puct to reconcile fuel costs to be included in its deferred overrecovery balance in the trueup proceeding described below this reconciliation covers the period from july 1998 through december 2001 the puct will review an alj report addressing the reconciliation and will likely issue a decision in the first quarter of 2005 the overrecovery balance and the subsequent provisions for probable disallowances totaled 212 million including interest at december 31 2004 the puct will net the final amount against recoverable amounts determined by the trueup proceeding 

restructuring legislation in texas required utilities with stranded costs to use marketbased methods to value certain generating assets for determining stranded costs we have elected to use the sale of assets method to determine the market value of all of the generation assets of tcc for stranded cost purposes the amount of stranded costs under this market valuation methodology will be the amount by which the book value of tcc’s generating assets including regulatory assets and liabilities that were not securitized exceeds the market value of the generation assets as measured by the net proceeds from the sale of the assets tcc’s sale of its generating assets will be subject to a review in a trueup proceeding conducted by the puct tcc’s recorded net regulatory asset for amounts subject to approval in the trueup proceeding net of the deferred fuel overrecovery described above is approximately 16 billion we estimate that tcc’s trueup filing will exceed the total of its recorded net regulatory asset management expects that the trueup proceeding will be contentious and could possibly result in disallowances if we are unable after the trueup proceeding to recover all or a portion of our stranded plant costs generationrelated net regulatory assets wholesale capacity auction trueup regulatory assets other restructuring trueup items and costs it could have a material adverse effect on results of operations cash flows and possibly financial condition 

collection of our revenues in texas is concentrated in a limited number of reps   applies to aep tcc and tnc 

our revenues from the distribution of electricity in the ercot area of texas are collected from reps that supply the electricity we distribute to their customers currently we do business with approximately forty three reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the new texas market or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for our services or could cause them to delay such payments we depend on these reps for timely remittance of payments any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the timing and receipt of our cash flows thereby have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

we may not be able to respond effectively to competition applies to each registrant 

we may not be able to respond in a timely or effective manner to the many changes in the power industry that may occur as a result of regulatory initiatives to increase competition these regulatory initiatives may include deregulation of the electric utility industry in some markets to the extent that competition increases our profit margins may be negatively affected industry deregulation may not only continue to facilitate the current trend toward consolidation in the utility industry but may also encourage the disaggregation of other vertically integrated utilities into separate generation transmission and distribution businesses as a result additional competitors in our industry may be created and we may not be able to maintain our revenues and earnings levels or pursue our growth strategy 

while demand for power is generally increasing throughout the united states the rate of construction and development of new more efficient electric generation facilities may exceed increases in demand in some regional electric markets the startup of new facilities in the regional markets in which we have facilities could increase competition in the wholesale power market in those regions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition also industry restructuring in regions in which we have substantial operations could affect our operations in a manner that is difficult to predict since the effects will depend on the form and timing of the restructuring 

risks related to environmental regulation 

our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could harm our cash flow and profitability applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees and permits at all of our facilities these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future costs of compliance with environmental regulations could harm our industry our business and our results of operations and financial position especially if emission andor discharge limits are tightened more extensive permitting requirements are imposed additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase additionally in july 2004 attorneys general of eight states and others sued aep and other utilities alleging that carbon dioxide emissions from power generating facilities constitute a public nuisance under federal common law the suits seek injunctive relief in the form of specific emission reduction commitments from the defendants while we believe the claims are without merit the costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide emissions could harm our business and our results of operations and financial position 

we anticipate that we will incur considerable capital costs for compliance applies to each registrant other than tcc and tnc 

most of our generating capacity is coal burning we plan to install new emissions control equipment and may be required to upgrade existing equipment purchase emissions allowances or reduce operations we estimate that we will invest approximately 600 million to comply with existing federal and state regulations designed to limit nitrogen oxide “nox” emissions and approximately 12 billion to comply with existing federal and state regulations designed to limit sulfur dioxide “so 2 ” emissions we estimate that we will invest approximately 18 billion and an additional 150 million in operation and maintenance expenses to comply with currently proposed but as yet unadopted federal regulations designed to limit nox so 2 and mercury emissions through 2010 assuming certain contingencies between 2011 and 2020 we expect to incur additional costs for pollution control technology retrofits and investment of 16 billion however post2010 capital investment estimates are quite uncertain all of our estimates are subject to significant uncertainties about the outcome of several interrelated assumptions and variables including timing of implementation required levels of reductions allocation requirements of the new rules and our selected compliance alternatives as a result we cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty the actual costs to comply could differ significantly from the estimates all of the costs are incremental to our current investment base and operating cost structure these expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs should be recoverable from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions and should be recoverable through market prices in deregulated jurisdictions if not those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition 

governmental authorities may assess penalties on us for failures to comply with environmental laws and regulations   applies to each registrant 

if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations even if caused by factors beyond our control that failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines against us recent lawsuits by the epa and various states filed against us highlight the environmental risks faced by generating facilities in general and coalfired generating facilities in particular 

since 1999 we have been involved in litigation regarding generating plant emissions under the clean air act federal epa and a number of states alleged that we and eleven unaffiliated utilities modified certain units at coalfired generating plants in violation of the clean air act federal epa filed complaints against certain aep subsidiaries in us district court for the southern district of ohio a separate lawsuit initiated by certain special interest groups was consolidated with the federal epa case the alleged modification of the generating units occurred over a 20year period 

if these actions are resolved against us substantial modifications of our existing coalfired power plants would be required in addition we could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay penalties andor halt operations moreover our results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 

other parties have settled similar lawsuits an unaffiliated utility which operates certain plants jointly owned by cspco reached a tentative agreement to settle litigation regarding generating plant emissions under the clean air act negotiations are continuing and a settlement could impact the operation of certain of the jointly owned plants until a final settlement is reached cspco will be unable to determine the settlement’s impact on its jointly owned facilities and its future results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to power trading and wholesale businesses 

our revenues and results of operations are subject to market risks that are beyond our control applies to each registrant 

we sell power from our generation facilities into the spot market or other competitive power markets or on a contractual basis we also enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of our power marketing and energy trading operations with respect to such transactions we are not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments through mandated rates and our revenues and results of operations are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market prices for power in our regional markets and other competitive markets these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time it is reasonable to expect that trading margins may erode as markets mature and that there may be diminished opportunities for gain should volatility decline in addition ferc which has jurisdiction over wholesale power rates as well as independent system operators that oversee some of these markets may impose price limitations bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets fuel prices may also be volatile and the price we can obtain for power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel costs these factors could reduce our margins and therefore diminish our revenues and results of operations 

volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from 







































our power trading including coal gas and e mission allowances trading and power marketing and risk management policies cannot eliminate the risk associated with these activities applies to each registrant 

our power trading including coal gas and emission allowances trading and power marketing activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we attempt to manage our exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate the risks associated with these activities as a result we cannot predict the impact that our energy trading and risk management decisions may have on our business operating results or financial position 

we routinely have open trading positions in the market within established guidelines resulting from the management of our trading portfolio to the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish our financial results and financial position 

our power trading and risk management activities including our power sales agreements with counterparties rely on projections that depend heavily on judgments and assumptions by management of factors such as the future market prices and demand for power and other energyrelated commodities these factors become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future these estimates are made even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these estimates results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those calculations prove to be wrong or inaccurate 

our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our pooled electric generating facilities successfully applies to each registrant 

our performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of our electric generating facilities operating electric generating facilities involves many risks including 



















a decrease or elimination of revenues from power produced by our electric generating facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would adversely affect our results of operations 

parties with whom we have contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm our results of operations applies to each registrant 

we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or power could breach their obligations should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed our contractual prices which would cause our financial results to be diminished and we might incur losses although our estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty our actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict 

we are contractually required to operate a power generation facility that we have agreed to lease but the energy sales market for the facility’s excess energy is oversupplied applies to aep 

 

we have agreed to lease from juniper capital lp a nonregulated merchant power generation facility “facility” near plaquemine louisiana we sublease the facility to dow we operate the facility for dow dow uses a portion of the energy produced by the facility and sells the excess power to us we have agreed to sell up to all of the excess 800 mw to a third party at a price that is currently in excess of market this agreement is now being litigated if it is unenforceable we will be required to find new purchasers for up to 800 mw there can be no assurance that this power will be sold at prices that will exceed our costs to produce it if that were the case as a result of our obligations to dow we would be required to operate the facility at a loss   

we rely on electric transmission facilities that we do not own or control if these facilities do not provide us with adequate transmission capacity we may not be able to deliver our wholesale electric power to the purchasers of our power applies to each registrant 

we depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other unaffiliated power companies to deliver the power we sell at wholesale this dependence exposes us to a variety of risks if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate we may not be able to sell and deliver our wholesale power if a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited if restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure 

the ferc has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas access to transmission systems may in fact not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable we also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 

we do not fully hedge against price changes in commodities applies to each registrant 

we routinely enter into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas coal and emission allowances as part of our power marketing and energy and emission allowances trading operations in connection with these trading activities we routinely enter into financial contracts including futures and options overthe counter options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts these activities expose us to risks from price movements if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner we do not anticipate it could harm our financial position or reduce the financial contribution of our trading operations 

we manage our exposure by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of our positions ie to hedge our exposure to demand market effects of weather and other changes in commodity prices however we do not always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility to the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility our results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon our success in the market 

we are exposed to losses resulting from the bankruptcy of enron corp applies to aep except for last paragraph which applies to each registrant 

in 2002 certain of our subsidiaries filed claims against enron corp “enron” and its subsidiaries in the enron bankruptcy proceeding pending in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york at the date of enron’s bankruptcy certain of our subsidiaries had open trading contracts and trading accounts receivables and payables with enron in addition on june 1 2001 we purchased houston pipe line company “hpl” from enron various hpl related contingencies and indemnities from enron remained unsettled at the date of enron’s bankruptcy 

cushion gas use agreements  in connection with the 2001 acquisition of hpl we also entered into an agreement with bam lease company which grants hpl the exclusive right to use approximately 65 bcf of cushion gas required for the normal operation of the bammel gas storage facility at the time of our acquisition of hpl bank of america “boa” and certain other banks together with boa “boa syndicate” and enron entered into an agreement granting hpl the exclusive use of 65 bcf of cushion gas also at the time of our acquisition enron and the boa syndicate also released hpl from all prior and future liabilities and obligations in connection with the financing arrangement after the enron bankruptcy hpl was informed by the boa syndicate of a purported default by enron under the terms of the financing arrangement we are currently litigating the rights to the cushion gas 

in february 2004 in connection with boa’s dispute enron filed notices of rejection regarding the cushion gas use agreement and other incidental agreements we have objected to enron’s attempted rejection of these agreements in january 2005 we sold a 98 controlling interest in hpl including the bammel gas storage facility we indemnified the purchaser for damages if any arising from the litigation with boa 

commodity trading settlement disputes  in september 2003 enron filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court against aepes challenging aep’s offsetting of receivables and payables and related collateral across various enron entities and seeking payment of approximately 125 million plus interest in connection with gas related trading transactions aep has asserted its right to offset trading payables owed to various enron entities against trading receivables due to several aep subsidiaries the parties are currently in nonbinding courtsponsored mediation 

in december 2003 enron filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court against aepsc seeking approximately 93 million plus interest in connection with a transaction for the sale and purchase of physical power among enron aep and allegheny energy supply llc during november 2001 enron’s claim seeks to unwind the effects of the transaction aep believes it has several defenses to the claims in the action being brought by enron the parties are currently in nonbinding courtsponsored mediation management is unable to predict the final resolution of these disputes however the impact on results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be material 

potential for disruption exists if the delay of a ferc market power mitigation order is lifted applies to each registrant 

in july 2004 the ferc issued an order directing aep and two unaffiliated utilities to file generation market power analyses within 30 days we have presented evidence to ferc to demonstrate that we do not possess market power in geographic areas where we sell wholesale power in a december 2004 order ferc found that aep passed the screens in pjm and ercot but not in the spp area because aep did not pass the market share screen in spp ferc initiated a proceeding under section 206 of the fpa in which aep is rebuttably presumed to possess market power in spp consequently our revenues from sales in spp at market based rates after march 6 2005 will be collected subject to refund to the extent that prices are ultimately found not to be just and reasonable in february 2005 aep filed with the ferc revisions to its marketbased rate tariffs that cap the rates of wholesale power that aep delivers within its control area of the spp we are unable to predict the timing or impact of any further action by the ferc 

classes of service 

the principal classes of service from which the public utility subsidiaries of aep derive revenues and the amount of such revenues during the year ended december 31 2004 are as follows 



   







holding company regulation 

the provisions of puhca are administered by the sec puhca regulates many aspects of a registered holding company system such as the aep system puhca limits the operations of a registered holding company system to a single integrated public utility system and such other businesses as are incidental or necessary to the operations of the system in addition puhca governs among other things financings sales or acquisitions of utility assets and intrasystem transactions 

puhca and the rules and orders of the sec currently require that transactions between associated companies in a registered holding company system be performed at cost with limited exceptions over the years the aep system has developed numerous affiliated service sales and construction relationships and in some cases invested significant capital and developed significant operations in reliance upon the ability to recover its full costs under these provisions 

legislation has been introduced in numerous sessions of congress that would repeal puhca but no such legislation has passed 

aepcsw merger 

on june 15 2000 a wholly owned merger subsidiary of aep merged with and into csw now known as aep utilities inc as a result csw became a wholly owned subsidiary of aep the four wholly owned public utility subsidiaries of csw—pso swepco tcc and tnc—became indirect wholly owned public utility subsidiaries of aep as a result of the merger the merger was approved by the ferc and the sec 

on january 18 2002 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that the sec failed to properly explain how the merger met the requirements of puhca and remanded the case to the sec for further review the court held that the sec had not adequately explained its conclusions that the merger met puhca requirements that the merging entities be “physically interconnected” and that the combined entity was confined to a “single area or region” a hearing was held january 10 2005 before an alj an initial decision is expected from the alj later this year the sec will have the opportunity to review the initial decision 

management believes that the merger meets the requirements of puhca and expects the matter to be resolved favorably 

financing 

general 

companies within the aep system generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs acquisitions and construction the companies periodically issue longterm debt to reduce shortterm debt in recent history shortterm debt has been provided by aep’s commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities proceeds were made available to subsidiaries under the aep corporate borrowing program throughout 2004 aep was successful in accessing the commercial paper market certain public utility subsidiaries of aep also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity 

aep’s revolving credit agreements which backstop the commercial paper program include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and a 50 million crossacceleration provision at december 31 2004 aep was in compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency would be considered an immediate termination event see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2004 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to aep’s credit agreements 

aep’s subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as leasing arrangements including the leasing of utility assets and coal mining and transportation equipment and facilities 

credit ratings 

in 2004 aep executives met with representatives of the rating agencies to review aep and its registrant subsidiaries’ historical and forecasted financial condition operations and other matters 

in august 2004 moody’s placed aep on positive outlook in july 2004 sp upgraded the senior secured ratings of pso and swepco to a from bbb to date sp has not changed the ratings of aep or any other of its rated subsidiaries fitch did not change the ratings of aep or its rated subsidiaries during 2004 

the senior secured ratings on certain of aep’s rated subsidiaries will be removed where secured debt no longer exists 

see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2004 annual reports under the heading entitled financial condition for additional information with respect to the credit ratings of the registrants other than aegco 

environmental and other matters 

general 

aep’s subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities the environmental issues that are potentially material to the aep system include 













in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines injunctive relief and other sanctions see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations  included in the 2004 annual reports under the heading entitled environmental matters for information on current environmental issues  

if our expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation and associated operating costs are not recoverable from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions or market prices in deregulated jurisdictions those costs could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows and possibly financial condition 

the cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the aep system 

see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled environmental matters and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies included in the 2004 annual reports for further information with respect to environmental matters 

environmental investments 

investments related to improving aep system plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2003 and 2004 and the current estimate for 2005 are shown below substantial investments in addition to the amounts set forth below are expected by the system in future years in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generating plants for environmental quality controls in order to comply with air and water quality standards which have been or may be adopted future investments could be significantly greater if litigation regarding whether aep properly installed emission control equipment on its plants is resolved against any aep subsidiaries or emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the headings entitled future reduction requirements for nox so 2   and hg and estimated air quality investments  and   note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies included in the 2004 annual reports for more information regarding this litigation and environmental expenditures in general 



electric and magnetic fields 

emf are found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those charges this means that emf are created by electricity flowing in transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and appliances 

a number of studies in the past several years have examined the possibility of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects none has produced any conclusive evidence that emf does or does not cause adverse health effects 

management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from customers 

utility operations 

general 

utility operations constitute most of aep’s business operations utility operations include i the generation transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers and ii the supplying and marketing of electric power at wholesale through the electric generation function to other electric utility companies municipalities and other market participants aepsc as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities 

electric generation 

facilities 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries own approximately 34500 mw of domestic generation see deactivation and disposition of generating facilities for a discussion of planned and completed sales of certain of aep’s generating facilities pursuant to regulatory orders the aep public utility subsidiaries operate their generating facilities as a single interconnected and coordinated electric utility system see item 2 — properties for more information regarding aep’s generation capacity 

aep power pool and csw operating agreement 

apco cspco im kpco and opco are parties to the interconnection agreement dated july 6 1951 as amended interconnection agreement defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their generating plants this sharing is based upon each company’s “memberloadratio” the interconnection agreement has been approved by the ferc 

the memberload ratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies as of december 31 2004 the memberload ratios were as follows 

 



although customer choice was adopted in ohio in 2001 cspco and opco plan to remain functionally separated through at least december 31 2008 as authorized by their rate stabilization plan approved by the puco see management’s financial discussion and analysis and financial condition under the heading entitled regulatory matters ohio included in the 2004 annual reports and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring  included in the 2004 annual reports for more information 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the interconnection agreement and aep system interim allowance agreement during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 



pso swepco tcc tnc and aepsc are parties to a restated and amended operating agreement originally dated as of january 1 1997 csw operating agreement which has been approved by the ferc the csw operating agreement requires the west zone public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other aep west zone public utility subsidiaries as capacity commitments parties are compensated for energy delivered to recipients based upon the deliverer’s incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives revenues and costs arising from third party sales are shared based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary contributes that is sold to third parties upon the sale of its generation assets tcc will no longer supply generating capacity under the csw operating agreement 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties under the csw operating agreement during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 



power generated by or allocated or provided under the interconnection agreement or csw operating agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to customers or in the case of the ercot area of texas reps by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved other than in the ercot area of texas by the public utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale in ohio and virginia such rates are based on a statutory formula as those jurisdictions transition to the use of market rates for generation see regulation — rates  

under both the interconnection agreement and csw operating agreement power that is not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold in the wholesale market by aepsc on behalf of those subsidiaries see risk management and trading for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power 

aep’s system integration agreement which has been approved by the ferc provides for the integration and coordination of aep’s east and west zone operating subsidiaries this includes joint dispatch of generation within the aep system and the distribution between the two zones of costs and benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones including sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities it is designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the interconnection agreement and the csw operating agreement each of which controls the distribution of costs and benefits within each zone 

risk management and trading 

as agent for aep’s public utility subsidiaries aep sells excess power into the market and engages in power and natural gas risk management and trading activities focused in regions in which aep traditionally operates these activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas under physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices these contracts include physical transactions overthecounter swaps and exchangetraded futures and options the majority of physical forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts   these transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions as of december 31 2004 counterparties have posted approximately 98 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with aepsc for the benefit of aep’s public utility subsidiaries while as of that date aep’s public utility subsidiaries had posted approximately 2 million with counterparties since open trading contracts are valued based on changes in market power prices exposures change daily 

fuel supply 

the following table shows the sources of power generated by the aep system 

 



 

variations in the generation of nuclear power are primarily related to refueling and maintenance outages variations in the generation of natural gas power are primarily related to the availability of cheaper alternatives to fulfill certain power requirements and the deactivation or sale of certain gasfired plants owned by tcc and tnc price increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels generally result in increased use of other fuels 

coal and lignite  aep’s public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations shortterm and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms the price for most coal fuels has increased resulting in a trend that may continue management has responded to increases in the price of coal by rebalancing the coal used in its generating facilities with products from different coal regions and sources of differing heat rates and sulfur content this rebalancing is an ongoing process that is expected to continue management believes but cannot provide assurances that aep’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units see investmentsother for a discussion of aep’s coal marketing and transportation operations 

the following table shows the amount of coal delivered to the aep system during the past three years and the average delivered price of spot coal purchased by system companies 



the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including customers’ usage of electric power space limitations the rate of consumption at particular plants labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt deliveries at december 31 2004 the system’s coal inventory was approximately 31 days of normal usage this estimate assumes that the total supply would be utilized through the operation of plants that use coal most efficiently 

in cases of emergency or shortage system companies have developed programs to conserve coal supplies at their plants such programs have been filed and reviewed with officials of federal and state agencies and in some cases the relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the jurisdiction of such agency 

the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal government is authorized under prescribed conditions to reallocate coal and to require the transportation thereof for the use at power plants or major fuelburning installations experiencing fuel shortages 

natural gas  t hrough its public utility subsidiaries aep consumed over 94 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2004 for generating power a majority of the natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves reliability a portfolio of longterm monthly and seasonal firm purchase and transportation agreements that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices supplies natural gas requirements for each plant 

nuclear   im and stpnoc have made commitments to meet their current nuclear fuel requirements of the cook plant and stp respectively steps currently are being taken based upon the planned fuel cycles for the cook plant to review and evaluate im’s requirements for the supply of nuclear fuel im has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets until it decides that deliveries under longterm supply contracts are warranted tcc and the other stp participants have entered into contracts with suppliers for i 100 of the uranium concentrate sufficient for the operation of both stp units through spring 2011 and ii 100 of the uranium concentrate needed for stp through spring 2011 see deactivation and disposition of generation facilities for more information about tcc’s interest in stp 

for purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel im has completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool aep anticipates that the cook plant has storage capacity to permit normal operations through 2012 stp has onsite storage facilities with the capability to store the spent nuclear fuel generated by the stp units over their licensed lives 

nuclear waste and decommissioning 

im as the owner of the cook plant and tcc as a partial owner of stp have a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plants safely the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant and stp may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the 

















accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the cook plant and stp will not be significantly different than current projections see deactivation and disposition of generation facilities for more information about tcc’s interest in stp 

see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements entitled commitments and contingencies  included in the 2004 annual reports for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning and related litigation 

lowlevel radioactive waste  the llwpa mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials michigan and texas do not currently have disposal sites for such waste available aep cannot predict when such sites may be available but south carolina and utah operate lowlevel radioactive waste disposal sites and accept lowlevel radioactive waste from michigan and texas aep’s access to the south carolina facility is currently allowed through the end of fiscal year 2008 there is currently no set date limiting aep’s access to the utah facility see deactivation and disposition of generation facilities for more information about tcc’s interest in stp 

deactivation and disposition of generation facilities 

pursuant to ercot’s approval aep deactivated 16 gasfired power plants 8 tcc plants and 8 tnc plants separately tcc conducted an auction to sell all of its generation facilities in texas to establish the market value of the assets and tcc’s stranded costs in accordance with the texas act see texas regulatory assets and stranded cost recovery and postrestructuring wires charges  the competitive bidding process began in june 2003 after the puct issued a rule confirming tcc’s ability to establish the value of its generation assets and amount of stranded costs by selling the generation assets the puct engaged a consultant and designated a team to monitor the auction and advise tcc on the sale of its generating assets including requirements of the texas act for establishing stranded costs 

the assets had a generating capacity of 4497 mw and included the eight deactivated gasfired generating plants one coalfired plant tcc’s interest in oklaunion power station a hydroelectric facility and tcc’s interest in stp tcc has entered into agreements to sell its 78 share of oklaunion power station and its 252 share in stp and sold the remaining generation assets in july 2004 see notes 6 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring and acquisitions dispositions discontinued operations impairments assets held for sale and assets held and used  included in the 2004 annual reports for more information on the disposition of tcc generation facilities 

structured arrangements involving capacity energy and ancillary services 

in january 2000 opco and npc an affiliate of buckeye entered into an agreement relating to the construction and operation of a 510 mw gasfired electric generating peaking facility to be owned by npc opco is entitled to 100 of the power generated by the facility and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through 2005 after 2005 npc and opco will be entitled to 80 and 20 respectively of the power of the facility and both parties will generally be responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility 

certain power agreements 

aegco  since its formation in 1982 aegco’s business has consisted of the ownership and financing of its 50 interest in unit 1 of the rockport plant and since 1989 leasing of its 50 interest in unit 2 of the rockport plant the operating revenues of aegco are derived from the sale of capacity and energy associated with its interest in the rockport plant to im and kpco pursuant to unit power agreements which have been approved by the ferc 

the im power agreement provides for the sale by aegco to im of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco at the rockport plant whether or not power is available from aegco im is obligated to pay as a demand charge for the right to receive such power and as an energy charge for any associated energy taken by im when added to amounts received by aegco from any other sources such amounts will be at least sufficient to enable aegco to pay all its operating and other expenses including a rate of return on the common equity of aegco as approved by ferc currently 1216 the im power agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of unit 2 of the rockport plant has expired currently december 2022 unless extended in specified circumstances 

pursuant to an assignment between im and kpco and a unit power agreement between kpco and aegco aegco sells kpco 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to aegco from both units of the rockport plant kpco has agreed to pay to aegco the amounts which im would have paid aegco under the terms of the im power agreement for such entitlement the kpco unit power agreement was extended in november 2004 for an additional 18 years and now expires in december 2022 

aegco and aep have entered into a capital funds agreement pursuant to which among other things aep has unconditionally agreed to make cash capital contributions or in certain circumstances subordinated loans to aegco to the extent necessary to enable aegco to i maintain such an equity component of capitalization as required by governmental regulatory authorities ii provide its proportionate share of the funds required to permit commercial operation of the rockport plant iii enable aegco to perform all of its obligations covenants and agreements under among other things all loan agreements leases and related documents to which aegco is or becomes a party aegco agreements and iv pay all indebtedness obligations and liabilities of aegco aegco obligations under the aegco agreements other than indebtedness obligations or liabilities owing to aep the capital funds agreement will terminate after all aegco obligations have been paid in full 

ovec   aep cspco and several unaffiliated utility companies jointly own ovec the aggregate equity participation of aep and cspco in ovec is 442 in april 2004 aep agreed to sell a portion of its shares in ovec 73 of ovec to louisville gas and electric company the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2005 following the sale the aggregate equity participation of aep and cspco in ovec will be 4347 until september 1 2001 ovec supplied from its generating capacity the power requirements of a uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth ohio owned by the doe the sponsoring companies are now entitled to receive and obligated to pay for all ovec capacity approximately 2200 mw in proportion to their power participation ratios the aggregate power participation ratio of apco cspco im and opco is 421 the proceeds from the sale of power by ovec are designed to be sufficient for ovec to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital the intercompany power agreement icpa which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each will expire by its terms on march 12 2006 an amended and restated icpa has been unanimously approved and executed by the sponsoring companies and ovec to extend the term of the icpa for an additional 20 years to march 13 2026 the aggregate power participation ratio of the aep entities in the amended and restated icpa is 4347 the aepaffiliated owners of ovec and the other owners are evaluating the need for environmental investments related to their ownership interests which may be material 

buckeye   transmission service agreements between buckeye aep and other transmission owners provide for the transmission and delivery of power generated by buckeye at the cardinal station these transmission agreements were made pursuant to the applicable open access transmission tariffs oatt of aep and others on october 1 2004 aep joined pjm and the buckeye transmission service over the aep system was transferred under the pjm oatt buckeye is entitled under the cardinal station 

agreement to receive and is obligated to pay for the excess of its maximum onehour coincident peak demand plus a 15 reserve margin over the 1226500 kilowatts of capacity of the generating units which buckeye currently owns in the cardinal station such demand which occurred on january 23 2003 was recorded at 1409726 kilowatts 

electric transmission and distribution 

general 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power see item 2—properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines most of the transmission and distribution services are sold in combination with electric power to retail customers of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in their service territories these sales are made at rates established and approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the ferc see regulation—rates  the ferc regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions see regulation—ferc  as discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries other than aegco hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas in some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service these franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business for a discussion of competition in the sale of power see competition  

aep transmission pool 

transmission equalization agreement   apco cspco im kpco and opco operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and coordinated system and are parties to the transmission equalization agreement dated april 1 1984 as amended tea defining how they share the costs and benefits associated with their relative ownership of the extrahighvoltage transmission system facilities rated 345 kv and above and certain facilities operated at lower voltages 138 kv and above the tea has been approved by the ferc sharing under the tea is based upon each company’s “memberload ratio” the memberload ratio is calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies as of december 31 2004 the memberload ratios were as follows 



the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tea during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 



transmission coordination agreement   pso swepco tcc tnc and aepsc are parties to the tca the tca has been approved by the ferc and establishes a coordinating committee which is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the west zone public utility subsidiaries including the performance of transmission planning studies the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and compliance with the terms of the oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc relating to such tariff 

under the tca the west zone public utility subsidiaries have delegated to aepsc the responsibility of monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the aep oatt on their behalf the tca also provides for the allocation among the west zone public utility subsidiaries of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the aep oatt 

the following table shows the net credits or charges allocated among the parties to the tca during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 



transmission services for nonaffiliates   in addition to providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales aep’s public utility subsidiaries and other system companies also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies see regional transmission organizations transmission of electric power by aep’s public utility subsidiaries is regulated by the ferc 

coordination of east and west zone transmission   aep’s system transmission integration agreement provides for the integration and coordination of the planning operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of aep’s east and west zone public utility subsidiaries the system transmission integration agreement functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the tea and the tca the system transmission integration agreement contains two service schedules that govern 





the system transmission integration agreement contemplates that additional service schedules may be added as circumstances warrant 

regional transmission organizations 

on april 24 1996 the ferc issued orders 888 and 889 these orders require each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system the orders also require utilities to functionally unbundle their services by requiring them to use their own tariffs in making offsystem and thirdparty sales as part of the orders the ferc issued a proforma tariff that reflects the commission’s views on the minimum nonprice terms and conditions for nondiscriminatory transmission service in addition the orders require all transmitting utilities to establish an oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and require utilities to comply with standards of conduct that prohibit utilities’ system operators from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utility’s merchant energy employees the orders also allow a utility to seek recovery of certain prudently incurred stranded costs that result from unbundled transmission service 

in december 1999 ferc issued order 2000 which provides for the voluntary formation of rtos entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals 

as a condition of ferc’s approval in 2000 of aep’s merger with csw aep was required to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to one or more rtos in may 2002 aep announced an agreement with pjm to pursue terms for its east zone public utility subsidiaries to participate in pjm a fercapproved rto the aep east companies integrated into pjm on october 1 2004 

swepco and pso currently intend to transfer functional control of their transmission assets to spp subject to receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals in february 2004 the ferc conditionally approved spp as an rto in october 2004 the ferc issued an order granting rto status to spp subject to certain filings the arkansas public service commission and lpsc have required filings related to swepco’s transfer of functional control of transmission facilities to an rto the remaining west zone public utility subsidiaries tcc and tnc are members of ercot 

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2004 annual reports and management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled rto formation for a discussion of public utility subsidiary participation in rtos 

regional through and out rates 

in july 2003 the ferc issued an order directing pjm and the miso to make compliance filings for their respective oatts to eliminate the transactionbased charges for through and out to transmission service on transactions where the energy is delivered within the proposed midwest iso and pjm expanded regions combined footprint the elimination of the to rates will reduce the transmission service revenues collected by the rtos and thereby reduce the revenues received by transmission owners under the rtos’ revenue distribution protocols 

aep and several other utilities in the combined footprint filed a proposal for new rates to become effective december 1 2004 in november 2004 ferc eliminated the to rates and replaced the rates temporarily through march 2006 with a seams elimination cost adjustment seca fees aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries received approximately 1 96 million of to rate revenues for the twelve months ended september 30 2004 the last twelve months prior to joining pjm the portion of those revenues associated with transactions for which the to rate is being eliminated and replaced by seca fees was 171 million effective april 2006 all transmission costs that would otherwise be defrayed by to rates in the combined footprint will be subject to recovery from native load customers of aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries at this time management is unable to predict whether any resultant increase in rates applicable to aep’s internal load will be recoverable on a timely basis from state retail customers unless new replacement rates compensate aep for its lost revenues and any increase in aep’s east zone public utility subsidiaries’ transmission expenses from these new rates are fully recovered in retail rates on a timely basis future results of operations cash flows and financial condition will be adversely affected see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled ferc order on regional through and out rates for more information 

regulation 

general 

except for retail generation sales in ohio virginia and the ercot area of texas aep’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional regulation by the state utility commissions while still regulated retail sales in michigan are now made at unbundled rates see electric restructuring and customer choice legislation and rates  aep’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the ferc under the fpa im and tcc are subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant and stp respectively aep and certain of its subsidiaries are also subject to the broad regulatory provisions of puhca administered by the sec 

rates 

historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service a utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes state utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of i a utility’s revenues and expenses during a defined test period and ii such utility’s level of investment absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time as part of a transition to customer choice of generation suppliers a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time 

the rates of aep’s public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service in ohio virginia and the ercot area of texas rates are transitioning from bundled costbased rates for electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service on the one hand and market pricing for andor customer choice of generation on the other in ohio the puco has approved the rate stabilization plans filed by opco and cspco which among other things address retail generation service rates through december 31 2008 in virginia apco’s base rates are capped subject to certain adjustments at their mid1999 levels until december 31 2010 or sooner if the vscc finds that a competitive market for generation exists in virginia 

historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the aep system reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes while the historical framework remains in a portion of aep’s service territory recovery of increased fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause is no longer provided for in ohio fuel recovery is also limited in the ercot area of texas but because aep sold mecpl and mewtu there is little impact on aep of fuel recovery procedures related to service in ercot 

the following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of each jurisdiction in which aep operates several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction 

indiana  im provides retail electric service in indiana at bundled rates approved by the iurc while rates are set on a costofservice basis utilities may also generally seek to adjust fuel clause rates quarterly im’s base rates were capped through december 31 2004 its fuel recovery rate was capped through february 29 2004 on september 22 2004 the iurc issued an order extending the interim fuel factor through march 2005 subject to trueup upon resolution of the previously filed but unexecuted corporate separation plan the status of additional base and fuel clause rate caps subject to certain conditions is presently under discussion with the parties to a proposed settlement agreement relating to aep’s corporate separation issues 

ohio  cspco and opco each operates as a functionally separated utility and provides “default” retail electric service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the ohio act through december 31 2005 the puco approved the rate stabilization plan filed by cspco and opco which among other things addresses default retail generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 retail generation rates would be determined consistent with the rate stabilization plan until december 31 2008 cspco and opco are and will continue to provide distribution services to retail customers at rates approved by the puco these rates will be frozen with certain exceptions from their levels as of december 31 2005 through december 31 2008 transmission services will continue to be provided at rates established by the ferc see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring  included in the 2004 annual reports for more information 

oklahoma  pso provides retail electric service in oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the occ pso’s rates are set on a costofservice basis fuel and purchased energy costs above the amount included in base rates are recovered by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail kilowatthour sales the factor is adjusted quarterly and is based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs over or under collections of fuel costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers when new quarterly factors are established see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2004 annual reports for information regarding current rate proceedings 

texas   the texas act requires the legal separation of generationrelated assets from transmission and distribution assets tcc and tnc currently operate on a functionally separated basis in january 2002 tcc and tnc transferred all their retail customers in the ercot area of texas to mecpl mewtu and aep commercial and industrial rep an aep affiliate tnc’s retail spp customers were ultimately transferred to mutual energy swepco lp an aep affiliate tcc and tnc provide retail transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the puct and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the ferc consistent with puct rules see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements entitled rate matters  included in the 2004 annual reports for information on current rate proceedings 

in may 2003 the puct delayed competition in the spp area of texas until at least january 1 2007 as such swepco’s texas operations continue to operate and to be regulated as a traditional bundled utility with both base and fuel rates 

virginia   apco provides unbundled retail electric service in virginia apco’s unbundled generation transmission which reflect ferc approved transmission rates and distribution rates as well as its functional separation plan were approved by the vscc in december 2001 

the virginia act which was amended in 2004 capped apco’s base rates at their mid1999 levels until the end of the transition period now december 31 2010 or sooner if the vscc finds that a competitive market for generation exists in virginia the virginia act permits apco to seek two changes to its capped rates as follows one prior to july 1 2007 and one between july 1 2007 and december 31 2010 in addition as a result of the 2004 amendments apco is entitled to annual rate changes to recover the incremental costs it incurs on and after july 1 2004 for transmission and distribution reliability and compliance with state or federal environmental laws or regulations the virginia act also allows adjustments to fuel rates during the transition period and continues to permit utilities to recover their actual fuel costs the fuel component of their purchased power costs and certain capacity charges apco recovers its generation capacity charges through capped base rates 

west virginia  apco and wheeling power company provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the wvpsc a plan to introduce customer choice was approved by the west virginia legislature in its 2000 legislative session however implementation of that plan was placed on hold pending necessary changes to the state’s tax laws in a subsequent session those changes have not been made management currently believes that implementation of the plan is unlikely 

while west virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs the most recent rate proceeding for both apco and wpco resulted in the suspension of their operative fuel clause mechanisms though they continue to recover a fixed level of fuel costs through bundled rates apco and wheeling power company are currently unable to change the current level of fuel cost recovery though this ability could be reinstated in a future proceeding 

other jurisdictions  the public utility subsidiaries of aep also provide service at regulated bundled rates in arkansas kentucky louisiana and tennessee and regulated unbundled rates in michigan 

the following table illustrates the current rate regulation status of the states in which the public utility subsidiaries of aep operate 

















ferc 

under the fpa ferc regulates rates for interstate sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects ferc regulations require aep to provide open access transmission service at fercapproved rates ferc also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers 

under the fpa the ferc regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by i approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and ii granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices aep has marketrate authority from ferc under which most of its wholesale marketing activity takes place in november 2001 the ferc issued an order in connection with its triennial review of aep’s market based pricing authority requiring i certain actions by aep in connection with its sales and purchases within its control area and ii posting of information related to generation facility status on aep’s website aep appealed that order and the ferc issued an order delaying the effective date of the order this was done in connection with the ferc’s adoption of a new test called supply management assessment sma 

in april 2004 the ferc issued two orders concerning utilities’ ability to sell wholesale electricity at marketbased rates in the first order the ferc adopted two new interim screens for assessing potential generation market power of applicants for wholesale market based rates and described additional analyses and mitigation measures that could be presented if an applicant does not pass one of these interim screens these two screening tests include a “pivotal supplier” test which determines if the market load can be fully served by alternative suppliers and a “market share” test which compares the amount of surplus generation at the time of the applicant’s minimum load in july 2004 the ferc issued an order on rehearing affirming its conclusions in the april order and directing aep and two unaffiliated utilities to file generation market power analyses within 30 days in the second order the ferc initiated a rulemaking to consider whether the ferc’s current methodology for determining whether a public utility should be allowed to sell wholesale electricity at marketbased rates should be modified in any way 

on august 9 2004 as amended on september 16 2004 and november 19 2004 aep submitted its generation market power screens in compliance with the ferc’s orders the analysis focused on the three major areas in which aep serves load and owns generation resources  ecar spp and ercot and the “first tier” control areas for each of those areas 

the pivotal supplier and market share screen analyses that aep filed demonstrated that aep does not possess market power in any of the control areas to which it is directly connected firsttier markets aep passed both screening tests in all of its “first tier” markets in its three “home” control areas aep passed the pivotal supplier test as part of pjm aep also passes the market share screen for the pjm destination market aep also passed the market share screen for ercot aep did not pass the market share screen as designed by the ferc for the spp control area 

in a december 17 2004 order ferc affirmed our conclusions that we passed both market power screen tests in all areas except spp because aep did not pass the market share screen in spp ferc initiated a proceeding under section 206 of the fpa in which aep is rebuttably presumed to possess market power in spp consequently our revenues from sales within our control area of the spp at market based rates after march 6 2005 will be collected subject to refund to the extent that prices are ultimately found not to be just and reasonable in february 2005 aep filed with the ferc revisions to its marketbased rate tariffs that cap the rates of wholesale power that aep delivers within its control area of the spp we are unable to predict the timing or impact of any further action by the ferc 

electric restructuring and customer choice legislation 

certain states in aep’s service area have adopted restructuring or customer choice legislation in general this legislation provides for a transition from bundled costbased rate regulated electric service to unbundled costbased rates for transmission and distribution service and market pricing for the supply of electricity with customer choice of supplier at a minimum this legislation allows retail customers to select alternative generation suppliers electric restructuring andor customer choice began on january 1 2001 in ohio and on january 1 2002 in michigan virginia and the ercot area of texas electric restructuring in the spp area of texas has been delayed by the puct until at least 2007 aep’s public utility subsidiaries operate in both the ercot and spp areas of texas 

implementation of legislation enacted in west virginia to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier is unlikely in order for west virginia’s choice plan to become effective tax legislation must be passed to preserve prelegislation levels of funding for state and local governments because such legislation has not been passed and because legislation enacted in march 2003 clarified the jurisdiction of the wvpsc over electric generation facilities management currently believes that implementation of the plan is unlikely in february 2003 arkansas repealed its restructuring legislation 

see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements entitled effects of regulation  included in the 2004 annual reports for a discussion of the effect of restructuring and customer choice legislation on accounting procedures see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring for additional information 

michigan customer choice 

customer choice commenced for im’s michigan customers on january 1 2002 rates for retail electric service for im’s michigan customers were unbundled though they continue to be regulated to allow customers the ability to evaluate the cost of generation service for comparison with other suppliers at december 31 2004 none of im’s michigan customers have elected to change suppliers and no alternative electric suppliers are registered to compete in im’s michigan service territory

the ohio act requires vertically integrated electric utility companies that offer competitive retail electric service in ohio to separate their generating functions from their transmission and distribution functions following the market development period which will terminate no later than december 31 2005 retail customers will receive distribution and where applicable transmission service from the incumbent utility whose distribution rates will be approved by the puco and whose transmission rates will be approved by the ferc cspco and opco filed a rate stabilization plan with the puco that among other things addresses default generation service rates from january 1 2006 through december 31 2008 see regulation—ferc for a discussion of ferc regulation of transmission rates and regulation—rates—ohio for a discussion of the impact of restructuring on distribution rates the puco approved the rate stabilization plan filed by cspco and opco with certain modifications the commission authorized cspco and opco to remain functionally separated through the end of that threeyear period 

texas restructuring 

signed into law in june of 1999 the texas act substantially amended the regulatory structure governing electric utilities in texas in order to allow retail electric competition for all customers among other things the texas act 











the texas act provides each affected utility an opportunity to recover its generation related regulatory assets and stranded costs resulting from the legal separation of the transmission and distribution utility from the generation facilities and the related introduction of retail electric competition regulatory assets consist of the texas jurisdictional amount of generationrelated regulatory assets and liabilities in the audited financial statements as of december 31 1998 stranded costs consist of the positive excess of the net regulated book value of generation assets as of december 31 2001 over the market value of those assets taking specified factors into account as ultimately determined in a puct trueup proceeding 

for a discussion of i regulatory assets and stranded costs subject to recovery by tcc and ii rate adjustments made after implementation of restructuring to allow recovery of certain costs by or with respect to tcc and tnc see texas regulatory asset and stranded cost recovery and postrestructuring wires charges and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring 

virginia restructuring 

in april 2004 the governor of virginia signed legislation that extends the transition period for electricity restructuring including capped rates through december 31 2010 the legislation provides specified cost recovery opportunities during the capped rate period including two optional general base rate changes and an opportunity for timely recovery through a separate rate mechanism of certain incremental environmental and reliability costs incurred on and after july 1 2004 

texas regulatory assets and stranded cost recovery and postrestructuring wires charges 

tcc may recover generationrelated regulatory assets and plantrelated stranded costs regulatory assets consist of the texas jurisdictional amount of generationrelated regulatory assets and liabilities in the audited financial statements as of december 31 1998 plantrelated stranded costs consist of the positive excess of the net regulated book value of generation assets as of december 31 2001 over the market value of those assets taking specified factors into account the texas act allows alternative methods of valuation to determine the fair market value of generation assets including outright sale full and partial stock valuation and asset exchanges and also for nuclear generation assets the excess cost over market ecom model carrying costs on stranded costs are also allowed to be recovered beginning january 1 2002 

tcc’s trueup proceedings will determine the amount and recovery of 



















the puct adopted a rule in 2003 regarding the timing of the trueup proceedings scheduling tcc’s filing 60 days after the completion of the sale of tcc’s generation assets due to regulatory and contractual delays in the sale of its generating assets tcc has not yet filed its trueup request 

tcc’s net trueup regulatory assets liabilities recorded at december 31 2004 is set forth in the following table

the texas act further permits utilities to establish a special purpose entity to issue securitization bonds for the recovery of generationrelated regulatory assets and after the trueup proceeding the amount of plantrelated stranded costs and remaining generationrelated regulatory assets not previously securitized securitization bonds allow for regulatory assets and plantrelated stranded costs to be refinanced with recovery of the bond principal and financing costs ensured through a nonbypassable rate surcharge by the regulated transmission and distribution utility over the life of the securitization bonds any plantrelated stranded costs or generationrelated regulatory assets not recovered through the sale of securitization bonds may be recovered through a separate nonbypassable competitive transition charge to transmission and distribution customers

competition 

the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry generally face increasing competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis primarily to other public utilities and power marketers the energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all generators have equal access to transmission services as a result there are more generators able to participate in this market the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 

aep’s public utility subsidiaries also compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they generally maintain a favorable competitive position with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher than the costs of some other sources of energy 

significant changes in the global economy in recent years have led to increased price competition for industrial customers in the united states including those served by the aep system some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from their suppliers of electric power in addition industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for example providing various offpeak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with the various state commissions occasionally these rates are first negotiated and then filed with the state commissions the public utility subsidiaries believe that they are unlikely to be materially adversely affected by this competition 

seasonality 

the sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business in many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time in other areas power demand peaks during the winter the pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of aep’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which aep enters in addition aep has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder unusually mild weather in the future could diminish aep’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition

cook nuclear plant and stp 

the following table provides operating information relating to the cook plant and stp 













costs associated with the operation excluding fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities im and tcc may also incur costs and experience reduced output at cook plant and stp respectively because of the design criteria prevailing at the time of construction and the age of the plant’s systems and equipment nuclear industrywide and cook plant and stp initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and maintenance costs at these plants however the ability of im and tcc to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant and stp respectively including replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the cook plant and stp whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs is not assured see item 1 — utility operations — electric generation — planned deactivation and planned disposition of generation facilities for a discussion of tcc’s planned disposition of its interest in stp 

transmission and distribution facilities 

the following table sets forth the total overhead circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines of the aep system and its operating companies and that portion of the total representing 765 kv lines 







titles 

the aep system’s generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority the rights of aep’s public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected thereby aep’s public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations recent legislation in ohio and virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes 

substantially all the fixed physical properties and franchises of tnc apco pso and swepco except for limited exceptions are subject to the lien of the mortgage and deed of trust securing the first mortgage bonds of each such company 

system transmission lines and facility siting 

laws in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines we have experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which our operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation these proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years 

construction program 

general 

the aep system with input from its state utility commissions continuously assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate thus system reinforcement plans are subject to change particularly with the restructuring of the electric utility industry aep forecasts 27 billion of construction expenditures for 2005 estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital 

proposed transmission facilities 

apco is proceeding with its plan to build the jacksons ferrywyoming 765 000volt transmission line the wvpsc and the vscc have issued certificates authorizing construction and operation of the line on december 31 2002 the us forest service issued a final environmental impact statement and record of decision to allow the use of federal lands in the jefferson national forest for construction of a portion of the line on may 11 2004 the decision of the forest service was challenged by the sierra club in the united states district court for the western district of virginia apco has intervened in that litigation  construction of the line is underway and the project is scheduled to be completed by june 2006 

proposed generation facility 

in conjunction with an environmental impact study issued in august 2004 in the third quarter of 2004 we announced plans to construct a syntheticgasfired plant or plants of approximately 1000 mw of capacity in the next five to six years utilizing integrated gasification combined cycle igcc technology we estimate that this new plant or plants will cost in the range of 17 billion we have not determined a location for the plant or plants but it or they will be in one of our eastern states because of ready access to coal we are currently performing site analysis and evaluation and at the same time working with state regulators and legislators to establish a framework for expedient recovery of this significant investment in new clean coal technology before final site selection we have filed with pjm for transmission analysis of sites in ohio west virginia and kentucky 

our significant planned environmental investments in emission control installations at existing coalfired plants and our commitment to igcc technology reinforce our belief that coal will be a loweremission domestic energy source of the future and further signals our commitment to investing in clean environmentally safe technology for additional information regarding anticipated environmental expenditures see management’s financial discussion and analysis of results of operations under the heading entitled the current air quality regulatory framework  

construction expenditures 

the following table shows construction expenditures including environmental expenditures during 2002 2003 and 2004 and current estimates of 2005 construction expenditures in each case including afudc but excluding assets acquired under leases 





the system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand business and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital environmental requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules and costs and in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities as well as variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal income and other taxes and other factors affecting cash requirements may increase or decrease the estimated capital requirements for the system’s construction program

a reflects total plant

b for economic or other reasons operation of the cook plant and stp for the
   full term of their operating licenses cannot be assured

c the capacity factors for both units of the cook plant were reduced in 2003
   due to an unplanned maintenance outage to implement upgrades to the traveling
   water screens system following an alewife fish intrusion

d the capacity factor for both units of the cook plant was significantly
   reduced in 2001 due to an unplanned dual maintenance outage in september 2001
   to implement design changes that improved the performance of the essential
   service water system

   costs associated with the operation excluding fuel maintenance and
retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less
predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large
part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability
of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the construction
and operation of nuclear facilities im and tcc may also incur costs and
experience reduced output at cook plant and stp respectively because of the
design criteria prevailing at the time of construction and the age of the
plants systems and equipment nuclear industrywide and cook plant and stp
initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and maintenance
costs at these plants however the ability of im and tcc to obtain adequate
and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant and stp
respectively including replacement power any unamortized investment at the end
of the useful life of the cook plant and stp whether scheduled or premature
the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs is not assured see

potential uninsured losses

   some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of
insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and
liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to the cook plant or stp
and costs of replacement power in the event of a nuclear incident at the cook
plant or stp future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured
unless allowed to be recovered through rates could have a material adverse
effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep im tcc and
other aep system companies see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements

titles

   the aep systems generating facilities are generally located on lands owned
in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of
the system has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to
easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory
authority the rights of aeps public utility subsidiaries in the realty on
which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the
conduct of their business minor defects and irregularities customarily found in
title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and
irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected
thereby aeps public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent
domain whereby they may if necessary acquire perfect or secure titles to or
easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility
operations

   substantially all the fixed physical properties and franchises of the aep
system operating companies except for limited exceptions are subject to the
lien of the mortgage and deed of trust securing the first mortgage bonds of each
such company

system transmission lines and facility siting

   legislation in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky louisiana
michigan ohio texas tennessee virginia and west virginia requires prior
approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage
transmission lines delays and additional costs in constructing facilities have
been experienced as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes
as well as in proceedings in which operating companies have sought to acquire
rightsofway through condemnation and such proceedings may result in
additional delays and costs in future years

construction program

general

   the aep system with input from its state utility commissions continuously
assesses the adequacy of its generation transmission distribution and other
facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and
energy to its customers in this assessment process assumptions are continually
being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans
are modified as appropriate thus system reinforcement plans are subject to
change particularly with the restructuring of the electric utility industry

proposed transmission facilities

   apco is proceeding with its plan to build the wyomingjacksons ferry
765000volt transmission line the wvpsc and the vscc have issued certificates
authorizing construction and operation of the line on december 31 2002 the
us forest service issued a final environmental impact statement and record of
decision to allow the use of federal lands in the jefferson national forest for
construction of a portion of the line apco must still receive additional
federal permits but does not expect that obtaining these will negatively affect
its ability to complete construction

   the system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised from
time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand business
and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital environmental
requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules and costs and
in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities as well as
variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal income and

b for economic or other reasons operation of the cook plant and stp for the
    full term of their operating licenses cannot be assured

c the capacity factor for both units of the cook plant was significantly
    reduced in 2001 due to an unplanned dual maintenance outage in september
    2001 to implement design changes that improved the performance of the
    essential service water system

d the cook plant was shut down in september 1997 to respond to issues raised
    regarding the operability of certain safety systems the restart of both
    units of the cook plant was completed with unit 2 reaching 100 power on
    july 5 2000 and unit 1 achieving 100 power on january 3 2001

     costs associated with the operation excluding fuel maintenance and
retirement of nuclear plants continue to be of greater significance and less
predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large
part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability
of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the construction
and operation of nuclear facilities im and tcc may also incur costs and
experience reduced output at cook plant and stp respectively because of the
design criteria prevailing at the time of construction and the age of the
plants systems and equipment nuclear industrywide and cook plant and stp
initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and maintenance
costs at these plants however the ability of im and tcc to obtain adequate
and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant and stp
respectively including replacement power any unamortized investment at the end
of the useful life of the cook plant and stp whether scheduled or premature
the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs is not assured see

planned disposition of generation facilities for a discussion of tccs planned
disposition of its interest in stp

potential uninsured losses

     some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of
insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and
liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to the cook plant or stp
and costs of replacement power in the event of a nuclear incident at the cook
plant or stp future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured
unless allowed to be recovered through rates could have a material adverse
effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep im tcc and
other aep system companies see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements

titles

     the aep systems electric generating stations are generally located on
lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and
distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private
owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to
appropriate statutory authority the rights of the system in the realty on which
its facilities are located are considered by it to be adequate for its use in
the conduct of its business minor defects and irregularities customarily found
in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects
and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected
thereby system companies generally have the right of eminent domain whereby
they may if necessary acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on
privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations

     substantially all the fixed physical properties and franchises of the aep
system operating companies except for limited exceptions are subject to the
lien of the mortgage and deed of trust securing the first mortgage bonds of each
such company

system transmission lines and facility siting

     legislation in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky michigan ohio
texas virginia and west virginia requires prior approval of sites of
generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines delays
and additional costs in constructing facilities have been experienced as a
result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes as well as in
proceedings in which operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway
through condemnation and such proceedings may result in additional delays and
costs in future years

construction program

 general

     the aep system is continuously involved in assessing the adequacy of its
generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide
for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this
assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new
information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as
appropriate thus system reinforcement plans are subject to change
particularly with the restructuring of the electric utility industry

 proposed transmission facilities

     apco is proceeding with its plan to build the wyomingjacksons ferry
765000volt transmission line the wvpsc and the vscc have issued certificates
authorizing construction and operation of the line on december 31 2002 the
us forest service issued a final environmental impact statement and record of
decision to allow the use of federal lands in the jefferson national forest for
construction of a portion of the line additional state and federal permits are
expected to be issued in the first half of 2003 through december 31 2002 apco
had invested approximately 51 million in this project the line is estimated to
cost 287 million with completion scheduled in 2006

titles

     the aep systems electric generating stations are generally located on
lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and
distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private
owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to
appropriate statutory authority the rights of the system in the realty on which
its facilities are located are considered by it to be adequate for its use in
the conduct of its business minor defects and irregularities customarily found
in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects
and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected
thereby system companies generally have the right of eminent domain whereby
they may if necessary acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on
privatelyheld lands used or to be used in their utility operations

     substantially all the fixed physical properties and franchises of the aep
system operating companies except for limited conditions and limitations are
subject to the lien of the mortgage and deed of trust securing the first
mortgage bonds of each such company

system transmission lines and facility siting

     legislation in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky michigan ohio
texas virginia and west virginia requires prior approval of sites of
generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines delays
and additional costs in constructing facilities have been experienced as a
result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes as well as in
proceedings in which operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway
through condemnation and such proceedings may result in additional delays and
costs in future years

     the east zone system is interconnected through 121 highvoltage
transmission interconnections with 25 neighboring electric utility systems the
alltime and 2001 onehour peak system demands were 25940000 and 25433000
kilowatts respectively which included 7314000 and 5469000 kilowatts
respectively of scheduled deliveries to unaffiliated systems which the system
might on appropriate notice have elected not to schedule for delivery and
occurred on june 17 1994 and july 24 2001 respectively the net dependable
capacity to serve the system load on such date including power available under
contractual obligations was 23457000 and 23974000 kilowatts respectively
the alltime and 2001 onehour internal peak demand was 20218000 kilowatts
and occurred on august 8 2001 the net dependable capacity to serve the system
load on such date including power dedicated under contractual arrangements was

b  for economic or other reasons operation of the cook plant and stp for the

c  the capacity factor for both units of the cook plant was significantly
     reduced in 2001 due to an unplanned dual maintenance outage in september
     2001 to implement design changes that improved the performance of the
     essential service water system
d  the cook plant was shut down in september 1997 to respond to issues raised
     regarding the operability of certain safety systems the restart of both
     units of the cook plant was completed with unit 2 reaching 100 power on
     july 5 2000 and unit 1 achieving 100 power on january 3 2001

     costs associated with the operation excluding fuel maintenance and
retirement of nuclear plants continue to be of greater significance and less
predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large
part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability
of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the construction
and operation of nuclear facilities im and cpl may also incur costs and
experience reduced output at cook plant and stp respectively because of the
design criteria prevailing at the time of construction and the age of the
plants systems and equipment nuclear industrywide and cook plant and stp
initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and maintenance
costs at these plants however the ability of im and cpl to obtain adequate
and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant and stp
respectively including replacement power any unamortized investment at the end
of the useful life of the cook plant and stp whether scheduled or premature
the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs is not assured see
competition and business change

potential uninsured losses

     some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of
insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and
liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to the cook plant or stp
and costs of replacement power in the event of a nuclear incident at the cook
plant or stp future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured
unless allowed to be recovered through rates could have a material adverse
effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep cpl im and
other aep system companies

aepcsw merger

     on june 15 2000 csw merged with and into a wholly owned merger subsidiary
of aep with csw being the surviving corporation the merger was pursuant to an
agreement and plan of merger dated as of december 21 1997 that aep and csw
had entered into as a result of the merger each outstanding share of common
stock par value 350 per share of csw other than shares owned by aep or csw
was converted into 06 of a share of common stock par value 650 per share of
aep csws four whollyowned domestic electric utility subsidiaries are cpl
pso swepco and wtu

     aep is complying or intends to comply with the following conditions imposed
by the ferc as part of the fercs order approving the merger

         transfer operational control of aeps east and west transmission
          systems to fullyfunctioning fercapproved regional transmission
          organizations see transmission services for nonaffiliates

         two interim transmissionrelated mitigation measures consisting of
          market monitoring and independent calculation and posting of available
          transmission capacity to monitor the operation of aeps east
          transmission system aep implemented these measures upon the
          consummation of the merger

         divestiture of 550 mw of generating capacity comprised of 300 mw of
          capacity in spp and 250 mw of capacity in ercot aep must complete
          divestiture of the spp capacity by july 1 2002 aep has completed
          divestiture of the ercot capacity

     the ferc found that certain energy sales of spp and ercot capacity would be
reasonable and effective interim mitigation measures until completion of the
required spp and ercot divestitures as required by the ferc the proposed
interim energy sales were in effect when the merger was consummated

     litigation on january 18 2002 the us court of appeals for the district
of columbia ruled that the sec failed to prove that the merger met the
requirements of puhca and remanded the case to the sec for further review the
court held that the sec must explain its conclusion that the merger met puhca
requirements that utilities be physically interconnected and justify its
finding that the merger will result in a combined entity that is confined to a
single area or region

     in its june 2000 approval of the merger the sec agreed with aep that aeps
and csws systems are interconnected because they have transmission access
rights to a single highvoltage line through missouri and also meet the puhcas
single region requirement because it is now technically possible to centrally
control the output of power plants across many states in its ruling the court
held that the sec failed to explain its conclusions that the transmission
integration and single region requirements are satisfied

     management believes that the merger meets the requirements of puhca and
expects the matter to be resolved favorably

regulation

   general

     aep and its subsidiaries are subject to the broad regulatory provisions of
puhca administered by the sec the public utility subsidiaries retail rates and
certain other matters are subject to regulation by the public utility
commissions of the states in which they operate such subsidiaries are also
subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act in respect of
rates for interstate sale at wholesale and transmission of electric power
accounting and other matters and construction and operation of hydroelectric
projects im and cpl are subject to regulation by the nrc under the atomic
energy act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the cook plant
and stp respectively

   possible change to puhca

     the provisions of puhca administered by the sec regulate all aspects of a
registered holding company system such as the aep system puhca requires that
the operations of a registered holding company system be limited to a single
integrated public utility system and such other businesses as are incidental or
necessary to the operations of the system in addition puhca governs among
other things financings sales or acquisitions of assets and intrasystem
transactions

     on june 20 1995 the sec released a report from its division of investment
management recommending a conditional repeal of puhca including its limits on
financing and on geographic and business diversification specific federal
authority however would be preserved over access to the books and records of
registered holding company systems audit authority over registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries and oversight over affiliate transactions this
authority would be transferred to the ferc following the report legislation
was introduced in congress to repeal puhca and transfer certain federal
authority to the ferc as recommended in the sec report since 1997 such puhca
repeal language has been reintroduced in each session of congress both as a
separate bill and as part of broader legislation regarding changes in the
electric industry legislative hearings were held but neither the house of
representatives nor the senate passed any puhca repeal legislation a number of
bills contemplating puhca repeal separately and with the restructuring of the
electric utility industry have been introduced in the current congress see
competition and business change if puhca is repealed registered holding
company systems including the aep system will be able to compete in the
changing industry without the constraints of puhca management of aep believes
that removal of these constraints would be beneficial to the aep system

     puhca and the rules and orders of the sec currently require that
transactions between associated companies in a registered holding company system
be performed at cost with limited exceptions over the years the aep system has
developed numerous affiliated service sales and construction relationships and
in some cases invested significant capital and developed significant operations
in reliance upon the ability to recover its full costs under these provisions

   conflict of regulation

     public utility subsidiaries of aep can be subject to regulation of the same
subject matter by two or more jurisdictions in such situations it is possible
that the decisions of such regulatory bodies may conflict or that the decision
of one such body may affect the cost of providing service and so the rates in
another jurisdiction in a case involving opco the us court of appeals for
the district of columbia held that the determination of costs to be charged to
associated companies by the sec under puhca precluded the ferc from determining
that such costs were unreasonable for ratemaking purposes the us supreme
court also has held that a state commission may not conclude that a ferc
approved wholesale power agreement is unreasonable for state ratemaking
purposes certain actions that would overturn these decisions or otherwise
affect the jurisdiction of the sec and ferc are under consideration by the us
congress and these regulatory bodies such conflicts of jurisdiction often
result in litigation and if resolved adversely to a public utility subsidiary
of aep could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or
financial condition of such subsidiary or aep

   rates

     the rates charged by the electric utility subsidiaries of aep are approved
by the ferc or one of the state utility commissions as applicable the ferc
regulates wholesale rates and the state commissions regulate retail rates in
recent years the number of rate increase applications filed by the operating
subsidiaries of aep with their respective state commissions and the ferc has
decreased under current rate regulation if increases in operating
construction and capital costs exceed increases in revenues resulting from
previously granted rate increases and increased customer demand then it may be
appropriate for certain of aeps electric utility subsidiaries to file rate
increase applications in the future

     generally the rates of aeps operating subsidiaries are determined based
upon the cost of providing service including a reasonable return on investment
except for the states of ohio texas and virginia as noted below certain states
served by the aep system allow alternative forms of rate regulation in addition
to the traditional costofservice approach however the rates of aeps
operating subsidiaries in those states continue to be costbased the iurc may
approve alternative regulatory plans which could include setting customer rates
based on market or average prices price caps indexbased prices and prices
based on performance and efficiency

     aep is exposed to risk from changes in the market prices of coal and
natural gas used to generate electricity where generation is no longer regulated
or where existing fuel clauses are suspended or frozen the protection afforded
by fuel clause recovery mechanisms has either been eliminated by the
implementation of customer choice in ohio effective january 1 2001 and in the
ercot power grid area of texas effective january 1 2002 or frozen by
settlement agreements in indiana michigan and west virginia to the extent the
fuel supply of the generating units in these states is not under fixed price
longterm contracts aep is subject to market price risk aep continues to be
protected against market price changes by active fuel clauses in oklahoma
arkansas louisiana kentucky virginia and the spp area of texas

     aep cannot predict the timing or probability of approvals regarding
applications for additional rate changes the outcome of action by regulatory
commissions or courts with respect to such matters or the effect thereof on the
earnings and business of the aep system in addition current rate regulation
may and in the case of ohio texas and virginia has been subject to
significant revision see competition and business change and the footnote to
the financial statements entitled customer choice and industry restructuring

properties for more information regarding the generating stations they operate
their generating plants as a single interconnected and coordinated electric
utility system and in the east zone share the costs and benefits in the aep
system power pool as discussed below under aep system power pool after
corporate separation the public utility subsidiaries that are no longer
regulated at the state level will participate in a separate power pool most of
the electric power generated at aeps generating stations is sold in
combination with transmission and distribution services to retail customers of
aeps utility subsidiaries in their service territories see regulationrates
some of the electric power is sold at wholesale to nonaffiliated companies

   aep system power pool

     apco cspco im kepco and opco are parties to the interconnection
agreement dated july 6 1951 as amended the interconnection agreement

calculated monthly on the basis of each companys maximum peak demand in
relation to the sum of the maximum peak demands of all five companies during the
preceding 12 months in addition since 1995 apco cspco im kepco and opco
have been parties to the aep system interim allowance agreement which provides
among other things for the transfer of so2 allowances associated with

     power marketing and trading transactions trading activities are conducted
by the aep power pool and shared among the parties under the interconnection
agreement trading activities involve the purchase and sale of electricity under
physical forward contracts at fixed and variable prices and the trading of
electricity contracts including exchange traded futures and options and
overthecounter options and swaps the majority of these transactions represent
physical forward contracts in the aep systems traditional marketing area and
are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts the regulated
physical forward contracts are recorded on a gross basis in the month when the
contract settles

     in addition the aep power pool enters into transactions for the purchase
and sale of electricity options futures and swaps and for the forward purchase
and sale of electricity outside of the aep systems traditional marketing area

     cpl pso swepco wtu and aep service corporation are parties to a
transmission coordination agreement originally dated as of january 1 1997
tca the tca establishes a coordinating committee which is charged with the
responsibility of overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission
facilities of the west zone operating subsidiaries including the performance of
transmission planning studies the interaction of such subsidiaries with
independent system operators iso and other regional bodies interested in
transmission planning and compliance with the terms of the open access
transmission tariff oatt filed with the ferc and the rules of the ferc
relating to such tariff

     under the tca the west zone operating subsidiaries have delegated to aep
service corporation the responsibility of monitoring the reliability of their
transmission systems and administering the oatt on their behalf the tca also
provides for the allocation among the west zone operating subsidiaries of
revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the
oatt

   transmission services for nonaffiliates

     aeps electric utility subsidiaries and other system companies also provide
transmission services for nonaffiliated companies

     on april 24 1996 the ferc issued orders 888 and 889 these orders require
each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to
file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers
services comparable to the utilitys own uses of its transmission system the
orders also require utilities to functionally unbundle their services by
requiring them to use their own tariffs in making offsystem and thirdparty
sales as part of the orders the ferc issued a proforma tariff which reflects
the commissions views on the minimum nonprice terms and conditions for
nondiscriminatory transmission service in addition the orders require all
transmitting utilities to establish an open access sametime information system
oasis which electronically posts transmission information such as available
capacity and prices and require utilities to comply with standards of conduct
which prohibit utilities system operators from providing nonpublic
transmission information to the utilitys merchant employees the orders also
allow a utility to seek recovery of certain prudentlyincurred stranded costs
that result from unbundled transmission service

     in december 1999 ferc issued order 2000 which provides for the voluntary
formation of regional transmission organizations rtos entities created to
operate plan and control utility transmission assets order 2000 also
prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable rto proposals

     on july 9 1996 the aep system companies filed a tariff conforming with
the fercs proforma transmission tariff

     since 1998 aep has engaged in discussions with a group of midwestern
utilities regarding the development of the alliance rto which may take the form
of an iso or an independent transmission company transco depending upon the
occurrence of certain conditions the transco if formed would operate
transmission assets that it would own and also would operate other owners
transmission assets on a contractual basis

     in 2001 the alliance companies filed with the ferc a proposed business plan
for the alliance rto in december 2001 the ferc issued an order approving the
proposal of the midwest iso an independent operator of transmission assets in
the midwest for an rto and rejecting the alliance rtos business plan and
finding that the alliance rto lacks sufficient scope and regional configuration
to exist as a standalone rto the ferc directed the alliance companies to
negotiate with the midwest iso and others to explore possible combinations
following such discussions on march 5 2002 the alliance rto filed with the
ferc a request for a declaratory order seeking resolution of these issues

seasonality

     sales of electricity by the aep system tend to increase and decrease
because of the use of electricity by residential and commercial customers for
cooling and heating and relative changes in temperature

franchises

     the operating companies of the aep system hold franchises to provide
electric service in various municipalities in their service areas these
franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates in general the
operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of
their business

competition and business change

   general

     the public utility subsidiaries of aep like many other electric utilities
have traditionally provided electric generation and energy delivery consisting
of transmission and distribution services as a single product to their retail
customers proposals are being made andor legislation has been enacted in
arkansas michigan ohio oklahoma texas virginia and west virginia that would
also require electric utilities to sell distribution services separately these
measures generally allow competition in the generation and sale of electric
power but not in its transmission and distribution however movement toward
retail deregulation in certain of these states is slowing as a consequence of
among other things adverse developments related to deregulation of the electric
industry in california

     competition in the generation and sale of electric power will require
resolution of complex issues including who will pay for the unused generating
plant of and other stranded costs incurred by the utility when a customer
stops buying power from the utility will all customers




                                       12
page

have access to the benefits of competition how will the rules of competition be
established what will happen to conservation and other regulatoryimposed
programs how will the reliability of the transmission system be ensured and
how will the utilitys obligation to serve be changed as competition in
generation and sale of electric power is instituted the public utility
subsidiaries of aep believe that they have a favorable competitive position
because of their relatively low costs if stranded costs are not recovered from
customers however the public utility subsidiaries of aep like all electric
utilities will be required by existing accounting standards to recognize any
stranded investment losses

     reference is made to managements discussion and analysis of results of
operations and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
contingencies and other matters and the footnote to the financial statements
entitled customer choice and industry restructuring incorporated by reference in
items 7 and 8 respectively for further information with respect to competition
and business change

   aep position on competition

     aep favors freedom for customers to purchase electric power from anyone
that they choose generation and sale of electric power would be in the
competitive marketplace to facilitate reliable safe and efficient service aep
supports creation of independent system operators to operate the transmission
system in a region of the united states aeps working model for industry
restructuring envisions a progressive transition to full customer choice
implementation of these measures would require legislative changes and
regulatory approvals

     the legislatures andor the regulatory commissions in many states
including some in aeps service territory are considering or have adopted
retail customer choice which in general terms means the transmission by an
electric utility of electric power generated by an entity of the customers
choice over its transmission and distribution system to a retail customer in
such utilitys service territory a requirement to transmit directly to retail
customers would have the result of permitting retail customers to purchase
electric power at the election of such customers not only from the electric
utility in whose service area they are located but from another electric
utility an independent power producer or an intermediary such as a power
marketer although aeps power generation would have competitors under some of
these proposals its transmission and distribution would not as competition
develops in retail power generation the public utility subsidiaries of aep
believe that they should have a favorable competitive position because of their
relatively low costs

   wholesale

     the public utility subsidiaries of aep like the electric industry
generally face increasing competition to sell available power on a wholesale
basis primarily to other public utilities and also to power marketers the
energy policy act of 1992 was designed among other things to foster
competition in the wholesale market a through amendments to puhca
facilitating the ownership and operation of generating facilities by exempt
wholesale generators which may include independent power producers as well as
affiliates of electric utilities and b through amendments to the federal
power act authorizing the ferc under certain conditions to order utilities
which own transmission facilities to provide wholesale transmission services for
other utilities and entities generating electric power the principal factors in
competing for such sales are price including fuel costs availability of
capacity and reliability of service the public utility subsidiaries of aep
believe that they maintain a favorable competitive position on the basis of all
of these factors however because of the availability of capacity of other
utilities and the lower fuel prices in recent years price competition has been
and is expected for the next few years to be particularly important

     ferc orders 888 and 889 issued in april 1996 provide that utilities must
functionally unbundle their transmission services by requiring them to use
their own tariffs in making offsystem and thirdparty sales see transmission
services the public utility subsidiaries of aep have functionally separated
their wholesale power sales from their transmission functions as required by
orders 888 and 889

   retail

     the public utility subsidiaries of aep have the exclusive right to sell
electric power at retail within their service areas in the states of arkansas
indiana kentucky louisiana oklahoma tennessee and west virginia
furthermore while customer choice commenced in michigan on january 1 2002 im
does not have any competing suppliers active in its michigan service territory
at this time however aeps public utility subsidiaries do compete with
selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural
gas fuel oil and coal within their service areas the primary factors in such
competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to
utilize sources of energy other than electric power with respect to
selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of aep believe that they
maintain a favorable competitive position on the basis of all of these factors
with respect to alternative sources of energy the public utility subsidiaries
of aep believe that the reliability of their service and the limited ability of
customers to substitute other costeffective sources for electric power place
them in a favorable competitive position even though their prices may be higher
than the costs of some other sources of energy

     significant changes in the global economy in recent years have led to
increased price competition for industrial companies in the united states
including those served by the aep system such industrial companies have
requested price reductions from their suppliers including their suppliers of
electric power in addition industrial companies which are downsizing or
reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs which may include
among other things the cost of electric power the public utility subsidiaries
of aep cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs through for
example various offpeak or interruptible supply options and believe that as
low cost suppliers of electric power they should be less likely to be
materially adversely affected by this competition and may be benefited by
attracting new industrial customers to their service territories

   aep restructuring plan

     as a result of deregulating legislation that has been enacted or is being
considered in several of the states in which the aep public utility subsidiaries
provide service aep has reassessed the corporate ownership of its public
utility subsidiaries assets deregulating legislation in some of the states
requires the separation of generation assets from transmission and distribution
assets on november 1 2000 aep filed with the sec under puhca for approval of
a restructuring plan in part to meet the requirements of this legislation this
application is pending

     on july 24 2001 aep filed with the ferc for approval of the restructuring
plan and on december 21 2001 a settlement agreement with six state regulatory
commissions and other major parties was filed with the ferc the settlement
agreement is pending approval ferc approval is necessary before the sec will
issue its order

     aeps restructuring plan is designed to align its legal structure and
business activities with the requirements of deregulation aeps plan
contemplates the formation of two first tier subsidiaries that would hold the
following public utility assets

         a subsidiary would hold the assets of public utility subsidiaries that
          remain subject to regulation as to rates by at least one state utility
          commission aep intends for this subsidiary ultimately to hold all
          transmission and distribution assets

         a subsidiary would hold i public utility and nonutility
          subsidiaries that derive their revenues from competitive activity and
          ii foreign utility subsidiaries and other investments aep intends
          for this subsidiary to ultimately hold all generation assets not
          subject to regulation

construction program

   general

     the aep system is continuously involved in assessing the adequacy of its
generation transmission distribution and other facilities to plan and provide
for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers in this
assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new
information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as
appropriate thus system reinforcement plans are subject to change
particularly with the restructuring of the electric utility industry and the
move to increasing competition in the marketplace see competition and business
change

   generation

     committed or anticipated capability changes to the aep systems generation
resources includes the expiration of the rockport unit 2 sale of 250 megawatts

capacity as part of the merger

     apart from these changes and temporary power purchases that can be
arranged there are no specific commitments for additions of new generation
resources on the aep system given the restructuring taking place in the
industry the extent of the need of aeps operating companies for any additional
generation resources in the foreseeable future is highly uncertain

   proposed transmission facilities

     on september 30 1997 apco refiled applications in virginia and west
virginia for certificates to build a wyomingcloverdale 765000volt project
the preferred route for this line was approximately 132 miles in length
connecting apcos wyoming station in southern west virginia to apcos cloverdale
station near roanoke virginia

     apco originally announced this project in 1990 since then it has been in
the process of trying to obtain federal permits and state certificates at the
federal level the us forest service forest service is directing the
preparation of an environmental impact statement eis which is required prior
to granting permits for crossing lands under federal jurisdiction permits are
needed from the i forest service to cross federal forests ii army corps of
engineers to cross the new river and a watershed near the wyoming station and
iii national park service or forest service to cross the appalachian national
scenic trail

     in june 1996 the forest service released a draft eis and preliminarily
identified a no action alternative as its preferred alternative for the
original wyomingcloverdale project if this alternative were incorporated into
a final eis apco would not be authorized to cross federal forests administered
by the forest service the forest service stated that it would not prepare the
final eis until after virginia and west virginia determined need and routing
issues on nonfederal lands

wyomingjacksons ferry 765000volt project

     proposed completion schedule and estimated cost subsequent to virginia and
west virginia granting certificates to construct the project the forest service
restarted the eis process and is scheduled to complete and release a supplement
to the draft eis in april 2002 the final eis process should continue for the
balance of 2002 with a decision on the federal permits anticipated in spring
2003 apco has also begun required consultation with the us fish and wildlife
service under the endangered species act which should be completed concurrently
with the eis process

     given the status of the project permitting process and assuming that the
projected schedule of the eis process will be met management estimates that the
wyomingjacksons ferry 765000volt project cannot be completed before summer
2006

     depending upon the outcome of the eis permitting process by the forest
service apcos estimated cost for the wyomingjacksons ferry project ranges
from 250 to 280 million assuming a summer 2006 inservice date

commitments and contingencies incorporated by reference in item 8 for further
information with respect to the construction plans of aep and its operating
subsidiaries for the next three years

     the system construction program is reviewed continuously and is revised
from time to time in response to changes in estimates of customer demand
business and economic conditions the cost and availability of capital
environmental requirements and other factors changes in construction schedules
and costs and in estimates and projections of needs for additional facilities
as well as variations from currently anticipated levels of net earnings federal
income and other taxes and other factors affecting cash requirements may
increase or decrease the estimated capital requirements for the systems
construction program

     from time to time as the system companies have encountered the industry
problems described above such companies also have encountered limitations on
their ability to secure the capital necessary to finance construction
expenditures

financing

     it has been the practice of aeps operating subsidiaries to finance current
construction expenditures in excess of available internally generated funds by
initially issuing unsecured shortterm debt principally commercial paper and
bank loans at times up to levels authorized by regulatory agencies and then to
reduce the shortterm debt with the proceeds of subsequent sales by such
subsidiaries of longterm debt securities and cash capital contributions by aep
if one or more of the subsidiaries are unable to continue the issuance and sale
of securities on an orderly basis such company or companies will be required to
consider the curtailment of construction and other outlays or the use of
alternative financing arrangements if available which may be more costly

     aeps subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize
additional financing arrangements such as unsecured debt and leasing
arrangements including the leasing of utility assets and coal mining and
transportation equipment and facilities pollution control revenue bonds have
been used in the past and may be used in the future in connection with the
construction of pollution control facilities however federal tax law has
limited the utilization of this type of financing except for purposes of certain
financing of solid waste disposal facilities and of certain refunding of
outstanding pollution control revenue bonds issued before august 16 1986

     new projects undertaken by aeps unregulated subsidiaries are generally
financed through equity funds provided by aep nonrecourse debt incurred on a
projectspecific basis debt issued by such subsidiaries or through a
combination thereof see wholesale business operations and item 7 for additional
information concerning aeps unregulated subsidiaries

     aeps revolving credit agreements include covenants and events of default
typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test and a
50 million crossacceleration provision at december 31 2001 aep was in
compliance with its debt covenants with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy
or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice
requirement before termination of the agreements a voluntary bankruptcy or
insolvency would be considered an immediate termination event

   natural gas

     aep consumed over 240 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2001 for the
system operating companies a majority of the gas fired electric generation
plants are connected to at least two natural gas pipelines which provides
greater access to competitive supplies and improves reliability natural gas
requirements for each plant are supplied by a portfolio of longterm and
shortterm purchase and transportation agreements that are acquired on a
competitive basis and based on market prices

   coal and lignite

     the clean air act amendments of 1990 provide for the issuance of annual
allowance allocations covering sulfur dioxide emissions at levels below historic
emission levels for many coalfired generating units of the aep system phase i
of this program began in 1995 and phase ii began in 2000 with both phases
requiring significant changes in coal supplies and suppliers the full extent of
such changes particularly in regard to phase ii however has not been
determined see environmental and other matters  air pollution control 
title iv acid rain program for the current compliance plan

     in order to meet emission standards for existing and new emission sources
the aep system companies will in any event have to obtain coal supplies by
entering into additional supply agreements either on a longterm or spot basis
at prices and upon terms which cannot now be predicted

     although aep believes that in the long run it will be able to secure coal
of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to enable existing and new units
to comply with emission standards applicable to such sources no assurance can
be given that coal of such quality and quantity will in fact be available no
assurance can be given either that statutes or regulations limiting emissions
from existing and new sources will not be further revised in future years to
specify lower sulfur contents than now in effect or other restrictions see
environmental and other matters herein

     the ferc has adopted regulations relating among other things to the
circumstances under which in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages it
might order electric utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other
regions or systems experiencing fuel shortages and to ratemaking principles by
which such electric utilities would be compensated in addition the federal
government is authorized under prescribed conditions to allocate coal and to
require the transportation thereof for the use of power plants or major
fuelburning installations

     system companies have developed programs to conserve coal supplies at
system plants which involve on a progressive basis limitations on sales of
power and energy to neighboring utilities appeals to customers for voluntary
limitations of electric usage to essential needs curtailment of sales to
certain industrial customers voltage reductions and finally mandatory
reductions in cases where current coal supplies fall below minimum levels such
programs have been filed and reviewed with officials of federal and state
agencies and in some cases the state regulatory agency has prescribed actions
to be taken under specified circumstances by system companies subject to the
jurisdiction of such agencies

     western coal purchased by system companies is transported to aep generating
stations by rail and via an affiliated river terminal for subsequent
transloading to barges for final delivery cpl pso and swepco own in the
aggregate 2982 coal hopper cars and apco im and opco lease in the
aggregate an additional 4066 coal hopper cars to be used in unit train

     the coal supplies at aep system plants vary from time to time depending on
various factors including customers usage of electric power space
limitations the rate of consumption at particular plants labor unrest and
weather conditions which may interrupt deliveries at december 31 2001 the
systems coal inventory was approximately 41 days of normal system usage this
estimate assumes that the total supply would be utilized by increasing or
decreasing generation at particular plants

     cpl and the other stp participants have entered into contracts with
suppliers for 100 of the uranium concentrate sufficient for the operation of
both stp units through spring 2006 and with an additional 50 of the uranium
concentrate needed for stp through spring 2007 in addition cpl and the other
stp participants have entered into contracts with suppliers for 100 of the
nuclear fuel conversion service sufficient for the operation of both stp units
through spring 2003 with additional flexible contracts to provide at least 50
of the conversion service needed for stp through 2008 cpl and the other stp
participants have entered into flexible contracts to provide for 100 of

operations and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
contingencies and other matters in the financial statements and commitments and
contingencies in the footnotes to these statements that are incorporated by
reference in items 7 and 8 respectively for information with respect to
nuclear waste and decommissioning and related litigation

     the ultimate cost of retiring the cook plant and stp may be materially
different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the

         type of decommissioning plan selected

         escalation of various cost elements including but not limited to
          general inflation

         further development of regulatory requirements governing
          decommissioning

         limited availability to date of significant experience in
          decommissioning such facilities

         technology available at the time of decommissioning differing
          significantly from that assumed in these studies

         availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities

accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of
decommissioning the cook plant and stp will not be significantly greater than
current projections

     lowlevel waste the lowlevel waste policy act of 1980 llwpa mandates
that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel waste rests with the
individual states lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary
refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials to
facilitate this approach the llwpa authorized states to enter into regional
compacts for lowlevel waste disposal subject to congressional approval the
llwpa also specified that beginning in 1986 approved compacts may prohibit the
importation of lowlevel waste from other regions thereby providing a strong
incentive for states to enter into compacts michigan the state where the cook
plant is located was a member of the midwest compact but its membership was
revoked in 1991 as a result michigan is responsible for developing a disposal
site for the lowlevel waste generated in michigan

     although michigan amended its law regarding lowlevel waste site
development in 1994 to allow a

introduced in 1996 to further address the issue but no action was taken
development of required legislation and progress with the site selection process
has been inhibited by many factors and management is unable to predict when a
new disposal site for michigan lowlevel waste will be available

     texas is a member of the texas compact which includes the states of maine
and vermont texas had identified a disposal site in hudspeth county for
construction of a lowlevel waste disposal facility during the licensing
process for the hudspeth site that site was found to be unsuitable no
additional site has been considered management is unable to predict when a
disposal site for texas lowlevel waste will be available

     on july 1 1995 the disposal site in south carolina reopened to accept
waste from most areas of the us including michigan and texas this was the
first opportunity for the cook plant to dispose of lowlevel waste since 1990
to the extent practicable the waste formerly placed in storage and the waste
presently generated by the cook plant and stp are now being sent to the disposal
site

     under state law the amounts of lowlevel radioactive waste being disposed
of at the south carolina facility from nonregional generators such as the cook
plant and stp are limited and being reduced nonregional access to the south
carolina facility is currently allowed through the end of fiscal year 2008

environmental and other matters

     aeps subsidiaries are subject to regulation by federal state and local
authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental
matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities in
addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations these laws and
regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance
including fines injunctive relief and other sanctions

     it is expected that

         costs related to environmental requirements will eventually be
          reflected in the rates of aeps electric utility subsidiaries or
          where states are deregulating generation unbundled transition period
          generation rates stranded cost wires charges and future market prices
          for electricity

         aeps electric utility subsidiaries will be able to provide for
          required environmental controls

however some customers may curtail or cease operations as a consequence of
higher energy costs there can be no assurance that all such costs will be
recovered moreover legislation adopted by certain states and proposed at the
state and federal level governing restructuring of the electric utility industry
may also affect the recovery of certain costs see competition and business
change

     except as noted herein aeps subsidiaries that own or operate generating
transmission and distribution facilities are in substantial compliance with
pollution control laws and regulations

     aeps international operations are subject to regulation with respect to
air waste and water quality standards and other environmental matters by
various authorities within the host countries under certain circumstances
these authorities may require modifications to these facilities and operations
or impose fines and other costs for violations of applicable statutes and
regulations from time to time these operations are made aware of various
environmental issues or are named as parties to various legal claims actions

     title i national ambient air quality standards attainment in july 1997
federal epa revised the ozone and particulate matter national ambient air
quality standards naaqs creating a new eighthour ozone standard and
establishing a new standard for particulate matter less than 25 microns in
diameter pm25 in addition to the potential financial consequences discussed
above both of these new standards have the potential to affect adversely the
operation of aep system generating units in may 1999 the us court of appeals
for the district of columbia circuit remanded the ozone and pm25 naaqs to
federal epa in february 2001 the us supreme court issued an opinion
reversing in part and affirming in part the court of appeals decision the
supreme court remanded the case to the court of appeals for further proceedings
including a review of whether adoption of the standards was arbitrary and
capricious and directed federal epa to develop a policy for implementing the
revised ozone standard in conformity with the caa the court of appeals held
oral argument on the remanded issues in december 2001

     nox sip call in october 1998 federal epa issued a final rule nox
transport sip call or nox sip call establishing statebystate nox emission
budgets for the fivemonth ozone season to be met beginning may 1 2003 the nox
budgets originally applied to 22 eastern states and the district of columbia and
are premised mainly on the assumption of controlling power plant nox emissions
projected for the year 2007 to 015 lb per million btu approximately 85 below
1990 levels although the reductions could be substantially greater for certain
state implementation plans the sip call was accompanied by a proposed federal
implementation plan which could be implemented in any state that fails to
submit an approvable sip the nox reductions called for by federal epa are
targeted at coalfired electric utilities and may adversely impact the ability
of electric utilities to construct new facilities or to operate affected
facilities without making significant capital expenditures

     in october 1998 the aep system operating companies joined with certain
other parties seeking a review of the final nox sip call rule in the us court
of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in march 2000 the court issued
a decision upholding the major provisions of the rule the court subsequently
extended the date for submission of sip revisions until october 30 2000 and
the compliance deadline until may 31 2004 in march 2001 the us supreme
court denied petitions filed by industry petitioners including aep system
operating companies seeking review of the court of appeals decision

     in may 1999 and march 2000 federal epa finalized the nox budget
allocations to be implemented through the nox sip call aep and other parties
filed petitions for review in the us court of appeals for the district of
columbia circuit and in june 2000 the court issued an opinion remanding the
budget determinations for further consideration of certain growth factor
assumptions made by federal epa in december 2000 federal epa issued a
determination that eleven states including certain states in which aep system
operating companies have sources covered by the nox sip call rule had failed to
submit complying sip revisions aep system operating companies and unaffiliated
utilities appealed this determination to the us court of appeals for the
district of columbia circuit and the court has stayed the proceeding pending
federal epa action on the remand of growth factor issues

     in april 2000 the texas natural resource conservation commission adopted
rules requiring significant reductions in nox emissions from utility sources
including those of cpl and swepco the rule compliance date is may 2003 for cpl
and may 2005 for swepco

     managements estimates indicate that compliance with the revised nox sip
call rule and sip revisions already adopted could result in required capital
expenditures for the aep system of approximately 16 billion of which
approximately 450 million has been expended through december 31 2001
reference is made to the footnote to the financial statements entitled
commitments and contingencies incorporated by reference in item 8 for
information with respect to aep registrant subsidiaries compliance cost
estimates and amounts expended

     in may 2001 opco completed a 175 million installation of selective
catalytic reduction scr technology to reduce nox emissions on its twounit
2600 mw gavin plant and during the 2001 ozone season may through september
operated the scr units construction of selective catalytic reduction technology
on amos plant unit 3 which is jointly owned by opco and apco and on apcos
mountaineer plant began in 2001 the amos and mountaineer projects expected to
be completed in 2002 are estimated to cost a total of 230 million management
has undertaken the gavin amos and mountaineer projects to meet applicable nox
emission reduction requirements additional expenditures of approximately 7
million are planned or undertaken to address certain operational issues arising
during initial operation of the gavin scr units

     since compliance costs cannot be estimated with certainty the actual costs
to comply could be significantly different from managements estimates depending
upon the compliance alternatives selected to achieve reductions in nox
emissions unless capital and operating costs of any additional pollution
control equipment necessary for compliance are recovered from customers through
regulated rates and market prices for electricity they could have a material
adverse effect on future results of operations cash flows and possibly
financial condition of aep and its affected subsidiaries

     section 126 petitions in january 2000 federal epa adopted a revised rule
granting petitions filed by certain northeastern states under section 126 of the
caa the petitions sought significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions
from utility and industrial sources the rule imposed emission reduction
requirements comparable to the nox sip call rule beginning may 1 2003 for most
of aeps coalfired generating units certain aep system operating companies and
other utilities filed petitions for review in the us court of appeals for the
district of columbia circuit in may 2001 the court issued an opinion which
upheld substantially the entire rule the court did not agree that federal epa
had properly supported the growth factors for the nox allowance budgets in
august 2001 the court issued an order tolling the may 1 2003 compliance date
pending resolution of the remand of the growth factor issues in january 2002
federal epa advised that it intends to establish may 31 2004 as the final
compliance date for the rule cost estimates for compliance with section 126 are
projected to be somewhat less than those set forth above for the nox sip call
rule reflecting the fact that section 126 does not apply to aegcos and ims

     west virginia so2 limits west virginia promulgated so2 limitations which
federal epa approved in february 1978 the emission limitations for opcos
mitchell plant have been approved by federal epa for primary ambient air quality
healthrelated standards only west virginia is obligated to reanalyze so2
emission limits for the mitchell plant with respect to secondary ambient air
quality welfarerelated standards because the caa provides no specific
deadline for approval of emission limits to achieve secondary ambient air
quality standards it is not certain when federal epa will take dispositive
action regarding the mitchell plant

     in august 1994 federal epa issued a notice of violation to opco alleging
that kammer plant was operating in violation of the applicable federally
enforceable so2 emission limit in may 1996 the notice of violation and an
enforcement action subsequently filed by federal epa were resolved through the
entry of a consent decree in the

us district court for the northern district of west virginia kammer plant has
achieved and maintained compliance with the applicable so2 emission limit for a
period in excess of one year pursuant to the provisions of the consent decree
in may 2001 the court terminated the consent decree

     short term so2 limits in january 1997 federal epa proposed a new
intervention level program under the authority of section 303 of the caa to
address fiveminute peak so2 concentrations believed to pose a health risk to
certain segments of the population the proposal establishes a concern level
and an endangerment level states must investigate exceedances of the concern
level and decide whether to take corrective action if the endangerment level is
exceeded the state must take action to reduce so2 levels in january 2001
federal epa published a federal register notice inviting comment with respect to
its decision not to promulgate a fiveminute so2 naaqs and intent to take final
action on the intervention level program by the summer of 2001 the effect of
this proposed intervention program on aep operations or financial performance
cannot be predicted at this time

     hazardous air pollutants hazardous air pollutant hap emissions from
utility boilers are potentially subject to control requirements under title iii
of the caaa which specifically directed federal epa to study potential public
health impacts of haps emitted from electric utility steam generating units in
december 2000 federal epa announced its intent to regulate emissions of mercury
from coal and oilfired power plants concluding that these emissions pose
significant hazards to public health a decision on whether to regulate other
haps emissions from these sources was deferred

     federal epa added coal and oilfired electric utility steam generating
units to the list of major sources of haps under section 112 c of the caa
which compels the development of maximum achievable control technology mact
standards for these units listing under section 112 c also compels a
preconstruction permitting obligation to establish casebycase mact standards
for each new or reconstructed source in the category mact standards for utility
mercury emissions are scheduled to be proposed by december 2003 and finalized by
december 2004 the utility air regulatory group which includes aep system
operating companies as members filed a petition with federal epa seeking
reconsideration of the decision to regulate mercury emissions from power plants
under section 112c of the caa

     in addition federal epa is required to study the deposition of hazardous
pollutants in the great lakes the chesapeake bay lake champlain and other
coastal waters as part of this assessment federal epa is authorized to adopt
regulations to prevent serious adverse effects to public health and serious or
widespread environmental effects in 1998 federal epa determined that the caa
is adequate to address any adverse public health or environmental effects
associated with the atmospheric deposition of hazardous air pollutants in the
great lakes the potential impact of adverse developments in these programs on
aep operations or financial performance cannot be predicted at this time

     title iv acid rain program the acid rain program title iv of the caaa

     regional haze in july 1999 federal epa finalized rules to regulate
regional haze attributable to anthropogenic emissions the primary goal of the
new regional haze program is to address visibility impairment in and around
class i protected areas such as national parks and wilderness areas because
regional haze precursor emissions are believed by federal epa to travel long
distances the rules address the potential regulation of such precursor
emissions in every state under the rule each state must develop a regional
haze control program that imposes controls necessary to steadily reduce
visibility impairment in class i areas on the worst days and that ensures that
visibility remains good on the best days in addition federal epa intends to
require best available retrofit technology bart for power plants and other
large emission sources constructed between 1962 and 1977

     in january 2001 federal epa proposed guidelines for states to use in
setting bart emission limits for power plants and other large emission sources
and in determining which sources are subject to those limits the proposed rule
calls for technologies which federal epa estimates are capable of reducing so2
emissions by 90 to 95 percent the proposed rule also contemplates that other
visibilityimpairing emissions must be reduced emission trading programs could
be used in lieu of unitbyunit bart requirements under the proposal provided
they yield greater visibility improvement and emission reductions

     the aep system is a significant emitter of fine particulate matter and
other precursors of regional haze and a number of aeps generating units could
be subject to bart controls federal epas regional haze rule may have an
adverse financial impact on aep as it may trigger the requirement to install
costly new pollution control devices to control emissions of fine particulate
matter and its precursors including so2 and nox the actual impact of the
regional haze regulations cannot be determined at this time aep system
operating companies and other utilities filed a petition seeking a review of the
regional haze rule in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia
circuit in august 1999

     permitting and enforcement the caaa expanded the enforcement authority of
the federal government by

         increasing the range of civil and criminal penalties for violations of
          the caa and enhancing administrative civil provisions

         imposing a national operating permit system emission fee program and
          enhanced monitoring recordkeeping and reporting requirements

     section 103 of cercla and section 304 of the emergency planning and
community righttoknow act require notification to state and federal
authorities of releases of reportable quantities rqs of hazardous and
extremely hazardous substances a number of these substances are emitted by
aeps power plants and other sources until recently emissions of these
substances whether expressly limited in a permit or otherwise subject to
federal review or waiver eg mercury were deemed federally permitted
releases which did not require emergency notification in december 1999
federal epa published interim guidance in the federal register which provided
that any hazardous substance or extremely hazardous substance not expressly and
individually limited in a permit must be reported if they are emitted at levels
above an rq specifically constituents of regulated pollutants eg metals
contained in particulate matter were not deemed to be federally permitted aep
system operating companies have provided supplemental information regarding air
releases from their facilities and are submitting followup reports federal epa
suspended its december 1999 guidance as it considers certain revisions to the
guidance settlement discussions regarding the guidance are underway

     global climate change in december 1997 delegates from 167 nations
including the us agreed to a treaty known as the kyoto protocol
establishing legallybinding emission reductions for gases suspected of causing
climate change the protocol requires ratification by at least 55 nations that
account for at least 55 of developed countries 1990 emissions of co2 to enter
into force

     although the us signed the treaty on november 12 1998 it was not sent
to the senate for

page

its advice and consent to ratification in a letter dated march 13 2001 from
president bush to four u s senators he indicated his opposition to the kyoto
protocol and said he does not believe that the government should impose
mandatory emissions reductions for co2 on the electric utility sector

     despite us opposition to the treaty at the seventh conference of the
parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change held in
marrakech morocco in november 2001 the parties finalized the rules procedures
and guidelines required to facilitate ratification of the treaty by most
nations and entry into force is expected by 2003

     since the aep system is a significant emitter of carbon dioxide its
results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected by the imposition of limitations on co2 emissions if
compliance costs cannot be fully recovered from customers in addition any
program to reduce co2 emissions could impose substantial costs on industry and
society and erode the economic base that aeps operations serve however it is
managements belief that the kyoto protocol is highly unlikely to be ratified or
implemented in the us in its current form aeps 4000 mw of coalfired
generation in the united kingdom acquired in 2001 may be exposed to potential
carbon dioxide emission control obligations since the uk is expected to be a
party to the kyoto protocol aep is developing an emissions mitigation plan for
these plants to ensure compliance as necessary

     on february 14 2002 president bush announced new climate change
initiatives for the us among the policies to be pursued is a voluntary
commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the economy by 18 within
the next ten years it is anticipated that the administration will seek to
partner with various industrial sectors including the electric utility
industry to reach this goal aep is unable to predict at this time the effect
that this program will have upon its operations or financial performance in the
future

     new source review in july 1992 federal epa published final regulations
governing application of new source rules to generating plant repairs and
pollution control projects undertaken to comply with the caa generally the
rule provides that plants undertaking pollution control projects will not
trigger new source review nsr requirements the natural resources defense
council and a group of utilities including five aep system operating companies
filed petitions in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia
circuit seeking a review of the regulations in july 1998 federal epa requested
comment on proposed revisions to the new source review rules which would change
new source review applicability criteria by eliminating exclusions contained in
the current regulation the administration and congress are considering
initiatives to reform the nsr requirements but no regulatory revisions have
been proposed to date

     new source review litigation on november 3 1999 following issuance by
federal epa of substantial information requests to aep system operating
companies the department of justice doj on federal epas behalf filed a
complaint in the us district court for the southern district of ohio that
alleges aep made modifications to generating units at certain of its coalfired
generating plants over the course of the past 20 years that extend unit
operating lives or restore or increase unit generating capacity without a
preconstruction permit in violation of the caa the complaint named opcos
cardinal unit 1 mitchell muskingum river and sporn plants and ims tanners
creek plant federal epa also issued notices of violation to aep alleging
similar violations at certain other aep plants

     in march 2000 doj filed an amended complaint that added allegations for
certain of the aep plants previously named in the complaint as well as counts
for apcos amos clinch river and kanawha river plants cspcos conesville
plant and opcos kammer plant in addition to the allegations regarding new
source review and new source performance standard violations doj included
allegations regarding visible particulate emission violations for cardinal and
muskingum river plants

     a number of northeastern and eastern states have been allowed to intervene
in the litigation and




                                       30
page

a number of special interest groups filed a separate complaint based on
substantially similar allegations which has been consolidated with the doj
complaint in addition to the plants named by the government and special
interest groups the intervenor states have included allegations concerning
opcos gavin plant

     in may 2000 aep filed a motion to dismiss with the district court which
if granted would dispose of most of the claims of the government and
intervenors

     in february 2001 the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary
judgment seeking a determination that four projects undertaken on units at
sporn cardinal and clinch river plants do not constitute routine maintenance
repair and replacement as used in the nsr programs in august 2001 the court
issued an order denying the plaintiffs motion as premature management believes
its maintenance repair and replacement activities were in conformity with the
caa and intends to vigorously pursue its defense

     a number of unaffiliated utilities have also received notices of violation
complaints or administrative orders relating to nsr a notice of violation was
issued in june 2000 to dpl with respect to its ownership interest in stuart
station in which cspco also owns a 26 percent interest wc beckjord unit 6
operated by cge in which cspco owns a 125 percent interest is also the
subject of an enforcement action cinergy corp the parent company of cge has
entered into an agreement in principle with the doj in an attempt to resolve the
litigation relating to wc beckjord unit 6 and other plants owned or operated
by cinergy and its subsidiaries this agreement in principle also covers the
zimmer plant which has not been the subject of an enforcement action vepco has
also entered into a similar agreement in principle neither cge nor vepco have
reached final agreements with the doj two other unaffiliated utilities tampa
electric company and pseg fossil llc have reached settlements with the federal
government

     in november 2000 several environmental groups filed a petition with ohio
epa seeking to have the draft title v operating permits for opcos cardinal and
muskingum river plants as well as the beckjord plant and a plant owned by an
unaffiliated utility modified to incorporate requirements and timetables for
compliance with new source review requirements in december 2000 a petition was
filed by these groups with the administrator of federal epa seeking a similar
modification of the final title v permit for cspcos conesville plant ohio epa
has refused to consider these petitions outside the regular title v permit
processing procedures or to interfere with the resolution of these issues by the
district court

     the caa authorizes civil penalties of up to 27500 per day per violation
at each generating unit 25000 per day prior to january 30 1997 in march
2001 the district court issued orders holding that claims for civil penalties
based on alleged activities that occurred more than five years prior to the
filing of the complaint are barred although the plaintiffs claims for
injunctive relief are not barred the court noted that the nature of the relief
ordered may be impacted by the plaintiffs delay in filing the complaints

     management is unable to estimate the loss or range of loss related to the
contingent liability for civil penalties under the caa proceedings and unable to
predict the timing of resolution of these matters due to the number of alleged
violations and issues to be determined by the court in the event the aep system
companies do not prevail any capital and operating costs of additional
pollution control equipment that may be required as well as any penalties
imposed could materially adversely affect future results of operations cash
flows and possibly financial condition unless such costs can be recovered
through regulated rates and market prices for electricity

   water pollution control

     the clean water act prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the
united states from point sources except pursuant to an npdes permit issued by
federal epa or a state under a federally authorized state program

     under the clean water act effluent limitations requiring application of
the best available technology economically achievable are to be




                                       31
page

applied and those limitations require that no pollutants be discharged if
federal epa finds elimination of such discharges is technologically and
economically achievable

     the clean water act provides citizens with a cause of action to enforce
compliance with its pollution control requirements since 1982 many such
actions against npdes permit holders have been filed to date no aep system
plants have been named in such actions

     all aep system generating plants are required to have npdes permits and
have received them npdes permit conditions and effluent limitations are
reviewed during the permit renewal process under federal epas regulations
operation under an expired npdes permit is authorized provided an application is
filed at least 180 days prior to expiration renewal applications are being
prepared or have been filed for renewal of npdes permits that expire in 2002

     the npdes permits generally require that certain thermal impact study
programs be undertaken these studies have been completed for all system plants
thermal variances are in effect for all plants with oncethrough cooling water
the thermal variances for cspcos conesville and opcos muskingum river plants
impose thermal management conditions that could result in load curtailment under
certain conditions but the cost impacts are not expected to be significant
based on favorable results of instream biological studies the thermal limits
for both conesville and muskingum river plants were raised in the renewed
permits issued in 1996 consequently the potential for load curtailment and
adverse cost impacts was further reduced in early 2002 aep submitted a
petition to ohio epa requesting additional less stringent thermal loading
limitations for these plants

     section 316b of the clean water act requires that cooling water intake
structures reflect the best technology available bta for minimizing adverse
environmental impact federal epa issued final regulations defining bta for new
sources that were published in the federal register on december 18 2001 new
sources are those commencing construction after january 17 2002 on february
28 2002 federal epa issued a proposed rule addressing bta for intake
structures at existing plants this proposal is expected to be published in the
federal register for comment in april 2002 under a previous courtestablished
schedule federal epa is required to issue final regulations for existing plants
by august 2003 federal epas rulemaking could result in a definition of bta
that could ultimately require retrofitting of certain existing plant intake
structures such changes would involve costs for aep system operating companies
but the significance of these costs cannot be determined at this time

     certain mining operations conducted by system companies as discussed under
fuel supply are also subject to federal and state water pollution control
requirements which may entail substantial expenditures for control facilities
not included at present in the systems construction cost estimates set forth
herein

     section 303 of the federal clean water act requires states to adopt
stringent water quality standards for a large category of toxic pollutants and
to identify specialized control measures for dischargers to waters where it is
shown that water quality standards are not being met in order to bring these
waters back into compliance total maximum daily load tmdl allocations of
these pollutants will be made and subsequently translated into discharge limits
in npdes permits federal epa has also directed that states take action to adopt
enhanced antidegradation of water quality requirements in october 2001
federal epa issued a rule delaying until april 30 2003 the effective date of
its tmdl rule issued in july 2000 the effective date of which had been
previously delayed by congress implementation of these provisions could result
in significant costs to the aep system if biological monitoring requirements and
water qualitybased effluent limits and requirements are placed in npdes
permits

     in march 1995 federal epa finalized a set of rules that establish minimum
water quality standards antidegradation policies and implementation procedures
for more stringently controlling releases of toxic pollutants into the great
lakes system this regulatory package is called the great lakes water quality
initiative glwqi the most direct compliance cost impact could be




                                       32
page

related to ims cook plant based on federal epas current policy on intake
credits and site specific variables and michigans implementation strategy
management does not presently expect the glwqi will have a significant adverse
impact on cook plant operations if indiana and ohio eventually adopt the glwqi
criteria for statewide application aep system plants located in those states
could be adversely affected although the significance depends on the
implementation strategy of those states

     oil pollution act the oil pollution act of 1990 opa defines certain
facilities that due to oil storage volume and location could reasonably be
expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment by
discharging oil such facilities must operate under approved spill response
plans and implement spill response training and drill programs opa imposes
substantial penalties for failure to comply aep system operating companies with
oil handling and storage facilities meeting the opa criteria have in place
required response plans training and drill programs

   solid and hazardous waste

     section 311 of the clean water act imposes substantial penalties for spills
of federal epalisted hazardous substances into water and for failure to report
such spills cercla expanded the reporting requirement to cover the release of
hazardous substances generally into the environment including water land and
air aeps subsidiaries store and use some of these hazardous substances
including pcbs contained in certain capacitors and transformers but the
occurrence and ramifications of a spill or release of such substances cannot be
predicted

     cercla rcra and similar state laws provide governmental agencies with the
authority to require cleanup of hazardous waste sites and releases of hazardous
substances into the environment and to seek compensation for damages to natural
resources since liability under cercla is strict joint and several and can be
applied retroactively aep system operating companies which previously disposed
of pcbcontaining electrical equipment and other hazardous substances may be
required to participate in remedial activities at such disposal sites should
environmental problems result

     aep system operating companies are identified as potentially responsible
parties prps for five federal sites where remediation has not been completed
including apco at one site cspco at one site im at two sites and opco at one
site aep has also been named a prp at two sites under state law managements
present estimates do not anticipate material cleanup costs for identified sites
for which aep subsidiaries have been declared prps in addition aep subsidiary
companies are engaged in certain remedial projects at various locations the
costs of which are not expected to be material however if significant costs
are incurred for cleanup future results of operations and possibly financial
condition could be adversely affected unless the costs can be recovered through
rates andor future market prices for electricity where generation is
deregulated

     regulations issued by federal epa under the toxic substances control act
govern the use distribution and disposal of pcbs including pcbs in electrical
equipment deadlines for removing certain pcbcontaining electrical equipment
from service have been met

     in addition to handling hazardous substances the system companies generate
solid waste associated with the combustion of coal the vast majority of which
is fly ash bottom ash and flue gas desulfurization wastes these wastes
presently are considered to be nonhazardous under rcra and applicable state law
and the wastes are treated and disposed of in surface impoundments or landfills
in accordance with state permits or authorization or are beneficially utilized
as required by rcra federal epa evaluated whether high volume coal combustion
wastes such as fly ash bottom ash and flue gas desulfurization wastes should
be regulated as hazardous waste in august 1993 federal epa issued a regulatory
determination that such high volume coal combustion wastes should not be
regulated as hazardous waste federal epa chose to address separately the issue
of low volume wastes such as metal and boiler cleaning wastes associated with
burning coal and other fossil fuels in may 2000 federal epa issued a
regulatory determination that such low volume wastes are also




                                       33
page

excluded from regulation under the rcra hazardous waste provisions when mixed
and comanaged with high volume fossil fuel combustion wastes

     all presently generated hazardous waste is being disposed of at permitted
offsite facilities in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and
regulations for system facilities that generate such wastes system companies
have filed the requisite notices and are complying with rcra and applicable
state regulations for generators nuclear waste produced at the cook plant and
stp and regulated under the atomic energy act is excluded from regulation under
rcra

     underground storage tanks federal epas technical requirements for
underground storage tanks containing petroleum required retrofitting or
replacement of an appreciable number of tanks compliance costs for tank
replacement were not significant some limited site remediation associated with
tank removal is ongoing but these costs are not expected to be significant

   electric and magnetic fields emf

     emf is found everywhere there is electricity electric fields are created
by the presence of electric charges magnetic fields are produced by the flow of
those charges this means that emf is created by electricity flowing in
transmission and distribution lines electrical equipment household wiring and
appliances

     a number of studies in the past several years have examined the possibility
of adverse health effects from emf while some of the epidemiological studies
have indicated some association between exposure to emf and health effects the
majority of studies have indicated no such association

     the energy policy act of 1992 established a coordinated federal emf
research program which ended in 1998 in 1999 the national institute of
environmental health sciences niehs as required by the act provided a report
to congress summarizing the results of this program the report concluded that
the probability that emf is truly a health hazard is currently small and
that the evidence that exists for health effects is insufficient to warrant
aggressive regulatory actions nevertheless the niehs identified several areas
where further research might be warranted aep has supported emf research
through the years and continues to fund the electric power research institutes
emf research program contributing over 400000 to this program in 2001 and
intending to contribute a similar amount in 2002 see research and development

     aeps participation in these programs is a continuation of its efforts to
monitor and support further research and to communicate with its customers and
employees about this issue residential customers of aep are provided
information and field measurements on request although there is no scientific
basis for interpreting such measurements

     some states have enacted regulations to limit the strength of magnetic
fields at the edge of transmission line rightsofway no state which the aep
system serves has done so

     management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the question of emf
exposure and adverse health effects if further research shows that emf exposure
contributes to increased risk of cancer or other health problems or if the
courts conclude that emf exposure harms individuals and that utilities are
liable for damages or if states limit the strength of magnetic fields to such a
level that the current electricity delivery system must be significantly
changed then the results of operations and financial condition of aep and its
operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected unless these costs
can be recovered from ratepayers

research and development

     aep and its subsidiaries are involved in over 100 research projects that
focus on

         exploring new methods of generating electricity such as through
          renewable sources eg wind solar

         enhancing energy trading infrastructure

         developing more efficient methods of operating generating plants

titles

     the aep systems electric generating stations are generally located on
lands owned in fee simple the greater portion of the transmission and
distribution lines of the system has been constructed over lands of private
owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to
appropriate statutory authority the rights of the system in the realty on which
its facilities are located are considered by it to be adequate for its use in
the conduct of its business minor defects and irregularities customarily found
in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects
and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties affected
thereby system companies generally have the right of eminent domain whereby
they may if necessary acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on
privatelyheld lands used or to be used in their utility operations

     substantially all the fixed physical properties and franchises of the aep
system operating companies except for limited conditions and limitations are
subject to the lien of the mortgage and deed of trust securing the first
mortgage bonds of each such company

system transmission lines and facility siting

     legislation in the states of arkansas indiana kentucky michigan ohio
texas virginia and west virginia requires prior approval of sites of
generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines delays
and additional costs in constructing facilities have been experienced as a
result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes as well as in
proceedings in which operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway
through condemnation and such proceedings may result in additional delays and
costs in future years

b  for economic or other reasons operation of the cook plant and stp for the

c  the capacity factor for both units of the cook plant was significantly
     reduced in 2001 due to an unplanned dual maintenance outage in september
     2001 to implement design changes that improved the performance of the
     essential service water system
d  the cook plant was shut down in september 1997 to respond to issues raised
     regarding the operability of certain safety systems the restart of both
     units of the cook plant was completed with unit 2 reaching 100 power on
     july 5 2000 and unit 1 achieving 100 power on january 3 2001

     costs associated with the operation excluding fuel maintenance and
retirement of nuclear plants continue to be of greater significance and less
predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large
part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability
of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the construction
and operation of nuclear facilities im and cpl may also incur costs and
experience reduced output at cook plant and stp respectively because of the
design criteria prevailing at the time of construction and the age of the
plants systems and equipment nuclear industrywide and cook plant and stp
initiatives have contributed to slowing the growth of operating and maintenance
costs at these plants however the ability of im and cpl to obtain adequate
and timely recovery of costs associated with the cook plant and stp
respectively including replacement power any unamortized investment at the end
of the useful life of the cook plant and stp whether scheduled or premature
the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs is not assured see
competition and business change

potential uninsured losses

     some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of
insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and
liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to the cook plant or stp
and costs of replacement power in the event of a nuclear incident at the cook
plant or stp future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured
unless allowed to be recovered through rates could have a material adverse
effect on results of operations and the financial condition of aep cpl im and
other aep system companies
