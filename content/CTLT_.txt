in addition to our expansion in biologics we have invested additional capital in several other existing facilities in order to expand in attractive markets including ongoing significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in winchester kentucky and the scalingup of commercial manufacturing capacity for our nextgeneration orally disintegrating tablet  “odt”  technology zydis ultra we have also added specialized new capabilities and capacity in early development over the last several fiscal years we acquired a leading position in consumerpreferred gummy and softchew formats for consumer health products with our acquisition of bettera holdings llc  “bettera wellness”  in fiscal 2022 we expanded our capacity for oral and injectable products via our fiscal 2020 acquisition of a facility in anagni italy and our capacity for spray dried dispersion and dry powder inhaler manufacturing via our fiscal 2021 acquisition of a facility located near boston massachusetts 

use our proprietary technologies and substantial expertise to help our customers develop new products 

we have broad and diverse technology platforms that are supported by deep scientific expertise extensive knowhow and more than 1400 patents and patent applications in approximately 140 families across advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation knowhow databases of formulated products and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise as a result approximately 90 of approvals by the fda over the last 25 years of new chemical entities presented in a softgel format have been developed and supplied by us 

in addition to resolving delivery challenges for our customers’ products we apply our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proofofconcept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for selfcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

operational leverage — deploy existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our active focus on continuous improvement and sustainability enhancement global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability along with the ongoing increase in the share of revenues from higher margin biologics offerings we expect this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2017 we have expanded gross margin by 250 basis points and adjusted ebitda margin by over 400 basis points note that “adjusted ebitda” is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the us  “ us gaap ”  and that further explanations of this measure and comparisons to the most directly comparable us gaap measures are set forth below at “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—nongaap metrics ” 

strategic acquisitions and licensing — build on our existing platform 

we operate in the markets for outsourced development solutions and commercial supply where we estimate current spending at approximately 70 billion globally our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer portfolio provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets to enter new markets and generate operating leverage through acquisitions since fiscal 2013 we have executed 21 transactions investing approximately 444 billion and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

while we are rigorously focused on driving our organic growth we have in recent years substantially increased our participation in biologics including proteinbased biologics cell and gene therapies pdna production and drug product fill and finish via strategydriven inorganic transactions we intend to continue opportunistically to source and execute strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within emerging treatment modalities new geographic markets or related market segments we have a dedicated corporate development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions 

“follow the molecule”® by providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to continue to use our development and manufacturing solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for early preclinical development of small molecules proteinbased biologics and cell and gene therapies through formulation and analytical services development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies and fill and finish of injectable products to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for clinical trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced technologies and expert stateoftheart manufacturing solutions that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in safe effective and in some cases patientpreferred dosage forms and to produce biologic drug substances needed for proteinbased biologics and cell and gene therapies our relationship with a molecule typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product and can extend throughout the molecule’s commercial life for prescription products we are typically the sole or primary outsourced provider and are frequently reflected in customers’ product approval applications our revenue from our development and manufacturing activities are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of an innovator drug’s market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply customers offering generic or biosimilar equivalents 

an example of the long and mutually productive relationships we foster can be found in a leading overthecounter antiallergy brand which today uses both our zydis odts and our liquigels softgel technology we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription product in our zydis odt format for six years and we have continued to provide the zydis form since the switch to overthecounter status in the us and other markets in the early 2000s subsequently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to 

the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 30yearlong relationship across multiple formats and markets

our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and consumer health companies along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices and companies in adjacent industries such as cosmetics we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers in fiscal 2022 we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 21 of the top 25 generics marketers 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 21 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally as well as with more than 1200 other customers faced with access pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities while reducing their fixed cost bases many midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies while facing the same pricing and market pressures have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills technologies and services required to bring their products to market consumer health companies require rapidly developed innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up with the fastpaced overthecounter medication dietary supplement and personal care markets these market segments are all important to our growth but require distinct solutions marketing and sales approaches and market strategy 

we follow a hybrid demandgeneration organization model with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering both supported by dedicated team of deeply experienced scientific advisors our sales organization currently consists of approximately 190 fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings as part of our marketing efforts we participate in major trade shows relevant to our offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and universe of target customers and that our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us 

global accounts 

we manage select accounts globally due to their substantial current business or growth potential we recorded approximately 43 of our total net revenue in fiscal 2022 from these global accounts each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization as well as operational quality and project management personnel to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally and account for more than threequarters of the active drug and biologic development pipeline historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to formulate develop analyze test and manufacture their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe central and south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of these customers in order to reach these emerging specialty and virtual companies we actively partner with leading venture capital investors and biotech incubators 

seasonality fluctuations in operation results 

our annual financial reporting period ends on june 30 excluding the impact from covid19 as discussed further in item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  factors affecting our performance our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in the us and europe the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses quality and confidentiality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice unit pricing in one or more tiers minimum volume commitments royalties manufacturing preparation services profitsharing and fixed fees we generally secure pricing and other contract mechanisms in our supply agreements to allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements permit us to raise or renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials we use to make products our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions the terms of our manufacturing supply agreements range from three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 45 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our softgel and oral technologies biologics and oral and specialty delivery segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our clinical supply services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2022 our backlog was 2850 million compared to 3767 million as of june 30 2021 including 549 million and 501 million respectively related to our clinical supply services segment we expect to recognize as revenue by the end of fiscal 2023 approximately 80 of the value of the backlog in existence as of june 30 2022 

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period or that involve minimum volume commitments we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers which often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns the matters discussed in this paragraph and other factors our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world as of june 30 2022 we had 58 facilities 5 geographical locations operate as multiple facilities because they support more than one reporting segment with one location including both a manufacturing facility and our corporate headquarters on four continents with approximately 8 million square feet of manufacturing laboratory office and related space our manufacturing capabilities generally include the full suite of competencies relevant to the support of each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

we operate our manufacturing facilities and development centers in accordance with cgmp or other applicable requirements all of these sites are registered where required with the fda or other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases our sites are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested 181 billion in our manufacturing and development facilities since fiscal 2020 for improvements and expansions including 660 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 we believe that our sites and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2022 we achieved approximately 95 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including lean six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan packaging films singleuse production components for drug substance production and glass vials and syringes for drug product the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics or geopolitical and other issues for example commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy  “ bse ”  have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers any future restriction that were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval periods 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process since regulators usually must approve changes to prescription product ingredient sources although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see “ risk factors—risks relating to our business and the industry in which we operate— our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials in addition the covid19 pandemic and the ongoing supplychain disruptions triggered by a combination of the pandemic and the ukrainianrussian war may interfere with the operations of certain of our direct or indirect suppliers or with 

international trade for these supplies which may either raise our costs or reduce the productivity or slow the timing of our operations 

competition 

we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including with other companies that offer conventional and advanced technologies for the development supply and delivery of medicinal products clinical trials support outsourced dose form proteinbased biologics or cell or gene therapy manufacturing or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america central and south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have access to more substantial resources which could be deployed to expand their range of offerings or capacity 

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant capabilities consistency of operational performance availability of equipment quality price value responsiveness and speed while we have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings and a few competitors that compete across many of our offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable company 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements research and development costs amounted to 23 million 21 million and 21 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and the industry in which we operate 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic 

any public health epidemic including the covid19 pandemic may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely including our customers and suppliers our business financial condition and results of operations may be affected by disruptions in our customers’ abilities to fund develop or bring to market products as anticipated delays in or disruptions to the conduct of clinical trials cancellations of contracts or confirmed orders from our customers decreased demand for categories of products in certain affected regions and inability difficulty or additional cost or delays in obtaining key raw materials components and other supplies from our existing supply chain among other factors caused by a public health epidemic including the covid19 pandemic 

while the covid19 pandemic has not had a material negative effect on our overall business financial condition or results of operations to date our customers and suppliers have in some cases experienced negative impacts due to disruptions in supply chains and disruptions to the operations of the fda and other drug regulatory authorities which resulted in among other things delays of inspections reviews and approvals of our customers’ products as well as the volume and timing of orders from these customers such impacts may affect our business in the future governmental restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic which continue to evolve including travel restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders business closures new safety requirements or regulations or restrictions on the import or export of certain materials or other operational issues related to the covid19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we continue to monitor developments related to the covid19 pandemic and its effects on our business operations and financial condition for purposes of our operational and financial planning we have made and update when appropriate certain assumptions regarding the duration severity and global economic impact of the pandemic in different regions and the need for continued manufacture and supply of covid19 vaccines and treatments each of which remains uncertain however despite careful planning our assumptions may not be accurate as the extent to which covid19 may affect our future results will depend on future developments that are uncertain including the duration of the pandemic emerging information concerning the severity and incidence of the virus and its variants the emergence of additional virus variants regional resurgences of the virus globally the safety efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments for covid19 including its variants the rate at which the population globally becomes vaccinated against covid19 the global economic impact of the pandemic the actions of governments and regulatory authorities to contain the pandemic or control the supply of vaccines and treatments and the actions the pharmaceutical industry competitors suppliers customers patients and others may take to contain or address the pandemic’s direct and indirect effects 

our biologics segment in particular has reported substantial revenue from the testing manufacturing and packaging of covid19related products for our customers while this positive impact is expected to continue through at least the remainder of calendar 2022 and into calendar 2023 the duration and extent of future revenues from such testing manufacturing and packaging of covid19related products is uncertain and dependent upon customer demand see also —risks related to our business and the industry in which we operate— the continually evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting public health response including the changing demand for various covid19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world may affect sales of the covid19 products we manufacture 

in addition the impact of the covid19 pandemic or any other public health epidemic could exacerbate other risks we face including those described elsewhere in risk factors 

the continually evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting public health response including the changing demand for various covid19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world may affect sales of the covid19 products we manufacture 

we manufacture or provide services for a variety of products intended for the prevention or treatment of covid19 and its symptoms and effects including both vaccines and treatments no single one of these products is material to our business certain of these products are subject to “takeorpay” provisions that require the customer to either purchase a minimum 

amount of product or pay any shortfall resulting from purchases not made such provisions should mitigate risks relating to any future uncertainty in the demand for these products 

the covid19related products we develop and manufacture have not yet received full marketing approval from certain regulatory authorities around the world for certain patient populations although some of these are being marketed and sold to such populations pursuant to an emergency use authorization eua from the fda or the equivalent authorization from nonus regulatory authorities should any of these covid19related products be denied any necessary regulatory approval the demand for such product could decrease significantly and therefore decrease customer orders for additional development manufacturing or packaging of those products although the financial effect on us may be mitigated by any takeorpay provision in place with respect to that product additionally the need for continued manufacture and supply of vaccines including “booster” doses and therapies to address the covid19 pandemic including new and developing variants of covid19 is highly uncertain and subject to various political economic and regulatory factors that are outside of our control should the us or other major regions worldwide determine that additional manufacture of covid19 vaccines boosters or therapies is no longer necessary it could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition in addition highlypublic political and social debate relating to the need for efficacy of or side effects related to one or more specific covid19 vaccines could contribute to changes in public perception of one or more covid19 vaccines manufactured by us which could decrease demand for a covid19 related product we develop manufacture or package 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities in addition customer spending may be affected by among other things the covid19 pandemic or recessionary economic conditions caused in whole or in part by the pandemic the ukrainianrussian war or the rise in inflation worldwide 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings available resources including funding for our biotechnology and other customers the need to develop new products and consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending our customers and potential customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in available financing for and spending by our customers for these reasons or because of the direct or indirect effects of the covid19 pandemic inflation and the ukrainianrussian war or other regional or global conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including competing with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing clinical trials support services or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies globally we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally 

we face substantial competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed some competitors have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with strategic acquisitions or with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customers’ requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could exceed our anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits 

even those without merit could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities adverse publicity and diversion of management’s time attention and resources 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 25 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability or other claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements including changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers in addition changes to our procedures or additional procedures implemented to comply with public health orders or best practice guidelines as a result of the covid19 pandemic may increase our costs or reduce our productivity and thereby affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we and our customers are subject to various local state federal national and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs similar bodies of the uk the eu and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world and in the future any change to such laws and regulations or the interpretation or application thereof could adversely affect us among other rules affecting us we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cgmp and drug safety as a result of the covid19 pandemic or other public health activity new public health orders or best practice guidelines may increase our costs to operate or reduce our productivity thereby affecting our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations or requests from regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals permits or registrations including those relating to products or facilities in addition any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical or medical device must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal national and transnational regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions that regulate our offerings and products 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us or our customers with applicable law or regulation or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore loss of a permit license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock and may subject us to regulatory action or costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our workforce with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings and despite our network of quality systems a quality or safety issue including with respect to a highrevenue product such as a covid19 vaccine or therapy could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition stock price or results of operations and may subject us to regulatory action including a product recall product seizure injunction to halt manufacture or distribution or restriction on our operations monetary fines or other civil or criminal sanctions in addition such an issue could subject us to 

adverse publicity and costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses the cost of which could be significant 

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex due in part to complex and exacting manufacturing processes and strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses time and expense spent investigating the cause lost production time and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often appreciably higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation the risks associated with running a highly complex facility doing exacting work with substantial regulatory oversight are enhanced for our larger sites like our bloomington indiana harmans maryland st petersburg florida or swindon uk sites which generally generate much more revenue 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological advances our services may become uncompetitive or obsolete and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies to the extent that such technologies are protected by patents their related offerings may become subject to competition as the patents expire without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings and technologies our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not obtain access to the innovations or have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations 

even if we succeed in creating or acquiring enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks knowhow trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect many of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will provide uniqueness or meaningful competitive differentiation in our offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur which may force us to compete with third parties thereby negatively affecting our revenue and profitability 

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of such proceedings may be unfavorable to us any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

there can be no assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

while we continue to apply in the us and certain other countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks there can be no assurance that third parties will not oppose our applications in the future in addition it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the us or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

license agreements with third parties control our rights to use certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies owned by third parties some of which are important to our business termination of these license agreements for any reason could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property causing an adverse change in our operations or the inability to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the us for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents if the patents on which our customers rely were successfully challenged and as a result the affected products become subject to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings 

our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and certain other countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claim that our offerings or processes infringe thirdparty intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of the claim’s merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters if any such claim results in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages in the us cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing offerings or processes discontinue the use of the infringing technology expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology license technology from the third party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all and lose the opportunity 

to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others 

in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

events that diminish tarnish or otherwise damage our brand may have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have built a strong brand in “catalent” with high overall and generally favorable awareness of the brand in our established markets and with target customers our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us in sales and marketing which is evidenced by our customer mix among top branded drug generics biologics and consumer health marketers we have spent and continue to spend substantial time money and other resources to establish both our brand awareness and a favorable perception of our brand in relevant markets among other strategies we participate in major international trade shows in our established markets and ensure visibility into our offerings through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program it is possible that a single event or aggregation of several events may diminish tarnish or otherwise damage our brand and adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations 

for example meaningful interruptions to our ability to reliably supply one or more customers with products on time whether as a result of supply chain disruptions or manufacturing delays or defects may diminish our customers’ confidence in our ability to timely meet our commitments thereby damaging our brand in addition we are subject to various local state federal national and transnational laws and regulations including the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea and similar bodies of the uk the eu and other comparable agencies around the world highly public or significant negative reports or findings from a regulatory agency with respect to one or more manufacturing or quality defects in our operations inspections of our facilities or other routine reviews could cause negative public perception of our operations negatively impacting our brand and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations in addition many of the other risks we face including those described elsewhere in risk factors could diminish tarnish or otherwise damage our brand 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials in addition the covid19 pandemic and the ongoing supplychain disruptions triggered by a combination of the pandemic and the ukrainianrussian war may interfere with the operations of certain of our direct or indirect suppliers or with international trade for these supplies which may either raise our costs or reduce the productivity or slow the timing of our operations 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by third parties for our offerings our customers also frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product and may supply other raw materials as well it is possible that any of our or our customers’ supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements import or export restrictions natural disasters international supply disruptions including those caused by public health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic and the ongoing ukrainianrussian war geopolitical issues operational or quality issues at the suppliers’ facilities and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin a critical component for manufacturing many of our softgel formats is only available from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative material could be subject to lengthy and uncertain formulation testing and regulatory approval 

in addition certain of our inputs are currently solesourced so any disruption related to such a supplier is more likely to have an impact on our operations replacing a solesource supplier of a production input to a medicine requiring marketing approval may be impossible or timeconsuming due to the rigorous standards we are obliged to apply to any new supplier 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for or public sentiment towards our customers’ products in the united states or internationally or other changes in applicable policies regarding the healthcare industry could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by affecting demand for our offerings 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform including with respect to reforming drug pricing adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings that they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for these offerings in particular it is possible that future legislation in the us may affect or put a cap on future pricing of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products while we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to us and other international laws affecting pharmaceutical and biotechnology products any substantial revision of applicable healthcare legislation could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers’ products which in turn could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or business changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices or in public or government sentiment for the industry as a whole could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we generated net operating losses “nols” in the past that have been and continue to be used to reduce taxable income utilization of our nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code ”  and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the internal revenue code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an “ ownership change ” generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange nols to reduce its postchange income may be limited in addition we acquired companies that generated preacquisition nols for tax purposes that will also be subject to limitation under section 382 and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our prechange nol carryforwards to reduce us federal state local and foreign taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

changes to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net deferred tax assets 

we have deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets and certain foreign net deferred tax assets it is possible we may experience a decline in us taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some additional portion or all our deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new and enhanced offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel or a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on 190 senior employees to lead and direct our business our senior leadership team is comprised of our subsidiaries’ executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market 

we employ more than 3000 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery biologics and gene and cell therapy formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets therefore global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

we may acquire businesses and offerings that complement or expand our business or divest nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete desired transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom the failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations and profitability 

our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities or divest assets or an ongoing business we face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration we or the purchaser of a divested asset or business may not be able to complete a desired transaction for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing 

any acquisition that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies which may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing desired divestitures we may have to expend cash incur debt or continue to absorb the costs of lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestiture whether we complete it or not may involve numerous risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with maintaining its business during the disposition process and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring remaining portions of the operations of the business to other facilities 

we provide services incorporating various advanced modalities including protein and plasmid production and cell and gene therapies and these modalities relate to relatively new modes of treatment that may be subject to changing public opinion continuing research and increased regulatory scrutiny each of which may affect our customers’ abilities to conduct their businesses or obtain regulatory approvals for their therapies and thereby adversely affect these offerings 

cell and gene therapy with or without the use of ipscs or plasmids remain relatively new means for treating disease and other medical conditions with only a few cell and gene therapies approved to date in the us the eu or elsewhere public perception may be influenced by claims that cell or gene therapies are unsafe and cell or gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community in addition ethical social legal and costbenefit concerns about cell or gene therapy genetic testing genetic research and the use of stem cells or materials derived from viruses could result in additional regulations or limitations or even outright prohibitions on certain cell or gene therapies or related products various regulatory and legislative bodies have expressed an interest in or have taken steps towards further regulation of various biotechnologies including cell and gene therapies more restrictive regulations or claims that certain cell or gene therapies are unsafe or pose a hazard could reduce our customers’ use of our services we can provide no assurance whether legislative changes will be enacted regulations policies or guidance changed or interpretations of existing strictures by agencies or courts changed or what the impact of such changes if any may be 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs or restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa osha and equivalent local state and national regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves in particular we are subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials byproducts of our manufacturing 

operations and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material included in our offerings and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities facilities we acquire in the future or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded reserves we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us and such activities may result in unanticipated costs or management distraction 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we have nearly 19000 individuals providing services for us worldwide including approximately 11700 service providers in north america 5700 in europe 1000 in south america and 600 in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils or labor organizations are active at our european facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environments and laws our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities collective bargaining or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employmentrelated costs or may result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make to increase the funding level will reduce the cash available for our business such as the payment of our interest expense 

certain of our current and former employees in the us the uk germany france japan belgium and switzerland are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2022 the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was 28 million primarily related to our pension plans in the uk and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of 38 million as of june 30 2022 related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns applicable actuarial assumptions prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness 

our global operations are subject to economic and political risks that could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global and regional economic and political developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain our customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such mitigating measures may be unavailable costly or unsuccessful 

beginning in fiscal 2022 much of the world including the us and the eu began to experience inflation levels not seen in more than 30 years as a result prices for many of our inputs have risen in some cases dramatically if inflation stays at elevated levels or increases we may not be able to mitigate the impact of the increased costs we will bear through corresponding price increases to our customers which could have an impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

as a global enterprise fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar our reporting currency against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations 

as a company with significant operations outside of the us certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including our eurodenominated 2375 senior notes due 2028 the “2028 notes” are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar which is the currency that we use to report our financial results as a result changes in the exchange rates of these or any other applicable currency to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates affecting the various currencies in which we do business such volatility and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies 

tax legislative or regulatory initiatives new interpretations or developments concerning existing tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational enterprise with operations in the us and more than a dozen other countries across north and south america europe and the asiapacific region and we do business with suppliers and customers in many additional regions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of many jurisdictions outside of the us from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and existing legislation may be subject to additional regulatory changes or new interpretations  there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 

in addition us federal state local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by taxing authorities could result in adverse impacts to tax years open under statute or to our operating structures currently in place it is possible that the outcomes from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by taxing authorities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations compile and analyze financial and operational data and communicate among our employees customers and counterparties and the risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations we continuously work to install new and upgrade existing systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber security risks to enhance the protections available to us but such protections may be inadequate to address malicious attacks or inadvertent compromises affecting data security or the operability of such systems 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain process analyze and manage data to 

• facilitate the manufacture and distribution of thousands of inventory items in to and from our facilities 

• receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

• manage the accurate billing and collections for more than one thousand customers 

• create compile and retain testing and other product manufacturing or facilityrelated data necessary for meeting our and our customers’ regulatory obligations 

• manage the accurate accounting and payment for thousands of vendors and our employees 

• schedule and operate our global network of development manufacturing and packaging facilities 

• document various aspects of our activities including the agreements we make with suppliers and customers 

• compile financial and other operational data into reports necessary to manage our business and comply with various regulatory or contractual obligations including obligations under our bank loans and other indebtedness the federal securities laws the internal revenue code and other applicable state local and exus tax laws and communicate among our nearly 19000 workers spread across dozens of facilities over four continents 

we face various security threats on a regular basis including ongoing cyber security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure we deploy defenses against such threats and attacks and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques hardware and software typical of companies of our size and scope despite our security measures however our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by increasingly sophisticated intruders or others who try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems they are also susceptible to breach due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions our suppliers contractors service providers and other third parties with whom we do business also experience cyber threats and attacks that are similar in frequency and sophistication in many cases we have to rely on the controls and safeguards put in place by our suppliers contractors service providers and other third parties to defend against respond to and report these attacks we cannot know the potential impact of future cyber incidents which vary widely in severity and scale there can be no assurance that the various procedures and controls we 

utilize to mitigate these threats will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems in part because i cyberattack techniques change frequently and at times new techniques are not recognized until launched and ii cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged or fail for any extended period 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

the size of our indebtedness and the obligations associated with it could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business expose us to interestrate risk to the extent of our variablerate debt or prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness these risks may be increased in a recessionary environment particularly as sources of capital may become less available or more expensive 

as of june 30 2022 we had 420 billion us dollar equivalent of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 143 billion of secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and 277 billion of senior unsecured indebtedness including 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5000 us dollardenominated senior notes due 2027 the “2027 notes” €825 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 notes 550 million aggregate principal amount of us dollardenominated 3125 senior notes due 2029 the “2029 notes” and 650 million aggregate principal amount of us dollardenominated 3500 senior notes due 2030 the “2030 notes” and together with the 2027 notes the 2028 notes and the 2029 notes the “senior notes” as of june 30 2022 we also held 234 million in finance lease obligations in addition we had 721 million of unutilized capacity under our 725 million secured revolving credit commitments due to 4 million of outstanding letters of credit which is part of our senior secured credit facilities the “revolving credit facility” 

the multibilliondollar size of our indebtedness could have important consequences for us including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest 

• exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of our eurodenominated notes 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions could result in one or more events of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness or through crossdefaults in agreements governing other indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or capital investments or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less indebtedness relative to their size and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our higher level of indebtedness prevents us from exploiting 

our total interest expense net was 123 million 110 million and 126 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloatingrate debt including as a result of our february 2021 interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na and assuming that our revolving credit facility is undrawn and libor is above any applicable minimum floor each change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in a change of approximately 9 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 

our interest expense may continue to increase as policymakers combat the inflation that has taken hold since fiscal 2022 through interestrate increases on benchmark financial products that can affect the interest rates on our variablerate debt 

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries are still capable of incurring significant additional debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition as of june 30 2022 we had approximately 721 million available to us for borrowing subject to certain conditions under our revolving credit facility if new debt is added to our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels the risks associated with debt we currently face would increase 

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of operating company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply which operating company’s amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may 20 2014 as amended the “ credit agreement ” calls “ restricted subsidiaries ”  to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock 

• pay certain dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments 

• pay distributions from restricted subsidiaries 

• issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries 

• guarantee certain indebtedness 

• make certain investments 

• sell or exchange certain assets 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• create certain liens and 

• consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of crossdefault provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

despite the limitations in our debt agreements we retain the ability to take certain actions that may interfere with our ability to timely pay our substantial indebtedness 

the covenants in the credit agreement and in the several indentures governing our senior notes collectively the indentures contain various exceptions to the limitations they otherwise impose on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to take the various actions described in the prior risk factor for example if the senior notes have investmentgrade ratings and we are not in default under these agreements certain of these covenants will not apply including the covenants restricting certain dividends and other payments the covenants concerning the incurrence of indebtedness and the covenants limiting guarantees of indebtedness by our restricted subsidiaries in addition the covenants restricting dividends and other distributions by us purchases or redemption of certain equity securities and prepayment redemption or repurchase of any subordinated indebtedness are subject to various exceptions 

we are currently using and may in the future use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness or changes in currency exchange rates and any such instrument may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we have executed and may enter into additional or new interestrate swap agreements currency swap agreements or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to adverse changes in variable interest rates and currency exchange rates such instruments may result in economic losses if for example prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixedrate commitment any such swap will expose us to creditrelated risks that if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price has historically been and may continue to be volatile and a holder of shares of our common stock may not be able to resell such shares at or above the price such stockholder paid or at all and could lose all or part of such investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile for the three years ended june 30 2022 our common stock price as quoted on the nyse ranged from 3695 to 14235 the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected by any one or more of several factors such as those listed above in “— risks relating to our business and industry in which we operate ” and the following 

• results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts or investors 

• results of operations that vary from those of our competitors 

• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts or investors 

• declines in the market prices of stocks generally or those of pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts new products acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures other strategic relationships or capital commitments 

• changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets such as increased inflation 

• changes in business or regulatory conditions or regulatory actions taken with respect to our business or the business of any of our competitors or customers 

• future sales of our common stock or other securities we may issue in the future 

• investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives 

• any decision by securities analysts to not publish research or reports about our business or to downgrade our stock or our sector 

• the public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties including our filings with or information furnished to the sec 

• announcements relating to or developments in litigation 

• guidance if any that we provide to the public any change in this guidance or any failure to meet this guidance 

• the availability of an active trading market for our common stock 

• public response to changes in the covid19 pandemic and public perceptions as to the need for manufacture of certain covid19related products and our role in the successful manufacture of such products 

• changes in the accounting principles we use to record our results or our application of these principles to our business and 

• other events or factors including those resulting from natural disasters hostilities acts of terrorism geopolitical activity public health crises including pandemics or responses to these events 

broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on the individual actions of our stockholders 

following periods of market volatility stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses if we become involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future receiving a return on an investment in our common stock may require a sale for a net price greater than what was paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future any future decision to pay a dividend in respect of our common stock and the amount and timing of any such dividend will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend such factors as they may deem relevant including general economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future alternative deployments of our cash our future capital requirements and contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our holders of shares of our common stock or by our subsidiaries to us in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result a holder of a share of our common stock may not receive any return on such investment unless it is sold for a price greater than that which was paid for it taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale 

future sales or the perception of future sales of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of our common stock sell their shares or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our equity securities that we wish to issue in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued or issuable in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our 

common stock subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the nyse or to restrictions set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness or the stockholders’ agreement between the company and holders of our formerly outstanding series a convertible preferred stock par value 001 the “series a preferred stock” any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments acquisitions or otherwise may result in dilution to the holders of shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

• advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings though our board of directors has implemented shareholder proxy access and 

• certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings 

provisions such as those just described to the extent that they remain in effect could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report this section of the annual report generally discusses the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 and yeartoyear comparisons between the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 the discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 and a comparison of our results for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 is included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 filed with the sec on august 30 2021 and is incorporated herein by reference in addition to historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements you should carefully read “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this annual report factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report particularly in “ item 1a risk factors ” 

overview 

we provide differentiated development and manufacturing solutions for drugs proteinbased biologics cell and gene therapies vaccines and consumer health products at over fifty facilities across four continents under rigorous quality and operational standards our oral injectable and respiratory delivery technologies along with our stateoftheart protein and cell and gene therapy manufacturing capacity address a wide and growing range of modalities and therapeutic and other categories across the biopharmaceutical and consumer health industries through our extensive capabilities growthenabling capacity and deep expertise in product development regulatory compliance and clinical trial and commercial supply we can help our customers take products to market faster including nearly half of new drug products approved by the fda in the last decade our development and manufacturing platforms our proven formulation supply and regulatory expertise and our broad and deep development and manufacturing knowhow enable our customers to advance and then bring to market more products and better treatments for patients and consumers our commitment to reliably supply our customers’ and their patients’ needs is the foundation for the value we provide annually we produce nearly 80 billion doses for nearly 8000 customer products or approximately 1 in every 23 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world we believe that through our investments in stateoftheart facilities and capacity expansion including investments in facilities focused on new treatment modalities and other attractive market segments our continuous improvement activities devoted to operational and quality excellence the sales of existing and introduction of new customer products and in some cases our innovation activities and patents we will continue to attract premium opportunities and realize the growth potential from these areas 

in fiscal 2022 we operated in four segments which also constitute the four reporting segments further described in business —our reporting segments contained elsewhere in this annual report biologics softgel and oral technologies  oral and specialty delivery and clinical supply services immediately following the end of fiscal 2022 we adopted a new operating structure with two operating segments 1 biologics and 2 pharma and consumer health discussed further in note 20 subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements 

the covid19 pandemic 

our response to covid19 

since the start of the covid19 pandemic we have taken steps to protect our employees ensure the integrity and quality of our products and services and maintain business continuity for our customers and their patients who depend on us to manufacture and supply critical products to the market t o address the multiple dimensions of the pandemic a senior multidisciplinary team regularly monitors the global situation executing mitigation activities as required 

among other things we implemented measures to avoid or reduce infection or contamination in line with guidelines issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention the world health organization and local authorities where we operate reemphasized good hygiene practices reorganized our workflows where permitted to maximize physical distancing required supervisor approval for employee travel facilitated safer alternatives to travel to and from work and employed in some cases remoteworking strategies  we also frequently monitor our supply chain to identify risks delays and concerns that may affect our ability to deliver our services and products during fiscal 2022 we did not identify any significant risk delay or concern that had a substantial effect on such delivery in part because of our adoption of various procedures to minimize and manage supply disruptions to our ongoing operations including through business continuity plans and careful attention to inventory levels to assure supply of needed inputs our existing procedures which are consistent with cgmp and other 

regulatory standards are intended to assure the integrity of our supply against any contamination we have a detailed response plan to manage impacts of the virus on employee health site operations and product supply including immediate assessment of the health of employees reporting symptoms comprehensive risk assessment of any impact to quality additional cleaning protocols and alternative shift patterns to compensate should fewer employees be available 

continuing effects of the pandemic combined with the ukrainianrussian war are likely to result in further or more severe supplychain disruptions in fiscal 2023 and potentially beyond we continue to execute our mitigation strategies but there can be no assurance of the continued effectiveness of these strategies 

impact of covid19 on our business and results of operations 

throughout the pandemic we have observed occasional customer delays and cancellations increases in absenteeism of production employees in our facilities in certain affected regions disruptions in certain clinical trials supported by our clinical supply services segment and delays in inspections and product approvals by the fda and regulatory authorities globally 

we have also seen substantial demand and related revenue from covid19related products particularly in our biologics segment in part to meet this demand we accelerated and enhanced certain of our capital improvement plans to expand capacity for manufacturing drug substance and drug product for proteinbased biologics and cell and gene therapies particularly at our drug product facilities in bloomington indiana anagni italy and our commercialscale viral vector manufacturing facility in harmans maryland and hired thousands of new employees we also implemented various strategies to protect our financial condition and results of operations should we experience a reduction in demand for covid19 related products such as inserting takeorpay and minimum volume requirements in the contracts we executed for the manufacture of certain covid19 related products however the extent and duration of revenue associated with covid19related products is uncertain and dependent in important respects on factors outside our control 

the future duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic and the future demand for covid19 vaccines and therapies is unknown public opinion regarding certain covid19 vaccines and therapies and the product owners and manufacturers continues to change and has affected the demand for certain products and services in addition the concentration of revenue from certain covid19 vaccine products enhances our operational risk with respect to quality security regulatory inspections and business disruption resulting from any unforeseen event that affects any of the facilities or communities in which we manufacture covid19 vaccines we have implemented various mechanisms to protect our customers their material and product and our business continuity including enhanced security measures at certain facilities and heightened cybersecurity controls 

see also “risk factors — risks related to our business and the industry in which we operate — our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic” and “risk factors — risks related to our business and the industry in which we operate — the continually evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting public health response including the changing demand for various covid19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world may affect sales of the covid19 products we manufacture” elsewhere in this annual report 

critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements regarding significant areas of judgment management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenue recognition 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply development services and clinical supply services 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment for our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements due to the regulated nature of our business these contract terms are highly interdependent and therefore are considered to be a single combined performance obligation for our development services and clinical supply services revenue our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations if a contract contains a single performance obligation we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation if a contract contains multiple performance obligations we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the “relative standalone selling price” as defined under accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  generally we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration if observable standalone selling prices are not available we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement determining the measure of progress that consistently depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment 

our customer contracts generally include provisions entitling us to a termination penalty when the customer terminates prior to the contract’s nominal end date the termination penalties in these customer contracts vary but are generally considered substantive for accounting purposes and create enforceable rights and obligations throughout the stated duration of the contract we account for a contract termination as a contract modification in the period in which the customer gives notice of termination the determination of the contract termination penalty is based on the terms stated in the relevant customer agreement as of the modification date we update our estimate of the transaction price using the expected value method subject to constraints and recognize the amount over the remaining performance period under the contract  in the event of a contract termination revenues are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when any uncertainty is subsequently resolved 

longlived and other definitelived intangible assets 

we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired with the remaining cost recorded as goodwill intangible assets primarily include customer relationships technology and trademarks valuing the identifiable intangible assets requires judgment for example we applied a multiperiod excessearnings method to measure the core technology acquired in the bettera wellness acquisition which included certain assumptions such as i the estimated annual net cash flows including application of an appropriate margin for forecasted revenue revenue obsolescence rate selling and marketing costs return on working capital contributory asset charges and other factors ii the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream and iii an assessment of the asset’s life cycle iv as well as other factors  intangible assets are generally amortized on a straightline basis reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

• significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 

• significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business 

• significant negative industry or economic trends and 

• recognition of goodwill impairment charges 

if we determine that the carrying value of identifiable intangibles andor longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying value of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis to be generated from such assets if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable we measure an impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair values of the assets see notes 3 business combinations and divestitures and 5 other intangibles net to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with asc 350  intangibles  goodwill and other  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed the evaluation may begin with a 

qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response or if no qualitative assessment is performed a quantitative assessment based upon discounted cash flows is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions in fiscal 2022 and 2020 we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment but in fiscal 2021 we began with the qualitative assessment accordingly no sensitivity analysis was performed for fiscal 2021 the evaluations performed in fiscal 2020 2021 and 2022 resulted in no impairment charge  

see notes 4 goodwill and 5 other intangibles net to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and the corresponding financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in fiscal 2018 we recorded a provision for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act the ”2017 tax act” but we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in the years after 2018 

the 2017 tax act imposed taxes on socalled “global intangible lowtaxed income” “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a us company in accordance with asc 740 we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred 

we assess the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering all available evidence both positive and negative we evaluate four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 

• carrybacks of existing nols if and to the extent permitted by tax law 

• future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 

• tax planning strategies and 

• future taxable income exclus ive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 

we consider the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets as a result of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law 

unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution 

our accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the us and in each of the nonus jurisdictions in which we operate particularly european tax jurisdictions the determination of income subject to taxation in each taxpaying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate in addition the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction for those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates we apply transferpricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions the estimates and assumptions used in these allocations can result in uncertainty in the measured tax benefit 

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our annual financial reporting period ends on june 30 excluding the impact from covid19 our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in europe and the us the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms in fiscal 2020 we completed the acquisition of and integrated additional gene and cell therapy assets in the us and belgium we also completed the acquisition of and integrated the anagni facility in italy in fiscal 2021 we expanded our capacity and capabilities through five acquisitions for our biologics segment and through the acquisition of a dry powder inhaler and spray dry manufacturing business from acorda therapeutics inc “acorda” in fiscal 2022 we acquired each of bettera wellness a manufacturer of a consumerpreferred gummy and other formats for consumer health products a commercialscale cell therapy manufacturing facility in princeton new jersey and a manufacturing facility for biologic therapies and vaccines near oxford uk  

foreign exchange rates 

our operating network is global and as a result we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the currency in which we report our financial results and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2022 approximately 36 of our net revenue was generated from our operations outside the us foreign currencies for our operations include the british pound european euro brazilian real argentine peso japanese yen and the canadian dollar 

inflation 

in fiscal 2022 we began to experience the effects of inflation which increased to levels not seen in more than 30 years in response we began to implement various mitigation strategies including in some cases increasing prices to customers or reducing other costs of operation including through price renegotiations with suppliers the effects of inflation after accounting for these mitigation strategies was immaterial to our financial results in fiscal 2022 but inflation is likely to continue for most or all of fiscal 2023 at least and there can be no assurance that our mitigating strategies will continue to enjoy the same degree of success 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry which has been estimated to generate more than 1 trillion in annual revenue including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors innovative pharmaceuticals and biologics in particular continue to play a critical role in the global market while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving consumer health product growth payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in earlystage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions and new treatment modalities additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with the global covid19 pandemic and health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of the global population will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals biologics and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved and new modality treatments will continue to escalate the need for advanced formulation and manufacturing product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

nongaap metrics 

as described in this section management uses various financial metrics including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in us gaap to measure and assess the performance of our business to make critical business decisions and to assess our compliance with certain financial obligations we therefore believe that presentation of certain of these nongaap metrics in this annual report will aid investors in understanding our business 

ebitda from operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense expense for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted for the income attributable to noncontrolling interests  “ ebitda from operations ”  ebitda from operations is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from operations provides investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes service debt and undertake capital expenditures without consideration of noncash depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for readers of the consolidated financial statements and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the most directly comparable measure to ebitda from operations defined under us gaap is net earnings included in this management’s discussion and analysis is a reconciliation of net earnings to ebitda from operations 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other income expense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expense stockbased compensation gain loss on sale of subsidiary and depreciation and amortization  “ segment ebitda ”  

adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement and in the indentures the ability of operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “ consolidated ebitda ” in the credit agreement and “ebitda” in the indentures adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement and indentures particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is based on the definitions in the credit agreement is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

in addition we use adjusted ebitda as a performance metric that guides management in its operation of and planning for the future of the business and drives certain management compensation programs management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a useful measure of our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core business including interest expense and noncash charges like depreciation and amortization 

the measure under us gaap most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net earnings in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are deducted when calculating ebitda from operations and net earnings consistent with the requirements of the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things 

• does not include noncash stockbased employee compensation expense and certain other noncash charges 

• does not include cash and noncash restructuring severance and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance operations 

• adds back any noncontrolling interest expense which represents minority investors’ ownership of nonwholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and is therefore not available and 

• includes estimated cost savings that have not yet been fully reflected in our results 

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share 

we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share which we sometimes refer to as “ adjusted eps ” as performance metrics adjusted net income is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations we believe that providing information concerning adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use these measures for business planning and executive compensation purposes we define adjusted net income as net earnings adjusted for 1 earnings or loss from discontinued operations net of tax 2 amortization attributable to purchase accounting and 3 income or loss from noncontrolling interest in majorityowned operations we also make adjustments for other cash and noncash items as shown above in “—adjusted ebitda” partially offset by our estimate of the tax effect of such cash and noncash items our definition of adjusted net income may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies adjusted net income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap

on a constantcurrency basis gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased 30 basis points to 341 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to 338 in the prior year primarily due to the higher margin profile associated with our biologics segment

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and use of cash 

our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations and the net proceeds of capital market activities the principal uses of cash are to fund operating and capital expenditures business or asset acquisitions interest payments on debt and any mandatory or discretionary principal payment on our debt as of june 30 2022 and following the september 2021 execution of amendment no 6 the “sixth amendment” to the credit agreement we had available a 725 million revolving credit facility that matures in may 2024 the capacity of which is reduced by the amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior secured credit facilities and those shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline borrowings at june 30 2022 we had 4 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

we believe that our cash on hand cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months including the amounts expected to become due with respect to our pending capital projects we have no significant maturity under any of our bank or note debt until the july 2027 maturity of our 2027 notes 

on august 9 2022 we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire metrics contract services metrics and will pay approximately 475 million in cash subject to customary adjustments metrics is an oral solids development and manufacturing business specializing in handling highly potent compounds at its facility in greenville north carolina we intend to fund this acquisition using a combination of cash on hand existing senior secured credit facilities and depending on market conditions potentially new debt financing the closing of the acquisition is not contingent on any financing activity 

cash flows 

fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 

the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared with the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 



operating activities 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 cash provided by operating activities was 439 million an increase of 6 million compared to 433 million for the prior year this increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income excluding the gain derived from the sale of the blowfillseal business in march 2021 a favorable impact from a decline in the rate of trade receivables growth and a favorable impact from a decline in the rate of inventory growth which was partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the increase in contract assets 

investing activities 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 cash used in investing activities was 188 billion compared to 649 million during fiscal 2021 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a 105 billion increase in cash used for business acquisition activities partially offset by a 52 million decline in the purchase of marketable securities and a 26 million decrease in cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment compared to the prior year another key driver in the yearoveryear change was the lack of proceeds from sale of any subsidiary as no subsidiary was sold in the current year compared to 290 million in proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries received in fiscal 2021 

financing activities 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 cash provided by financing activities was 103 billion which increased 889 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of 142 million during the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by a 934 million yearoveryear increase in cash received from the issuance of debt partially offset by the july 2020 exercise of an overallotment option on 12 million additional shares by the underwriter for the equity offering in june 2020 resulting in net proceeds of 82 million

in september 2021 we completed the sixth amendment to the credit agreement pursuant to the sixth amendment we incurred an additional 450 million aggregate principal amount of us dollardenominated term loans the “incremental term b3 loans ”  and amended the quarterly amortization payments from 025 to 02506 of the principal amount outstanding for the incremental term b3 loans and the other term loans outstanding under the credit agreement all of which are us dollardenominated together with the incremental term b3 loans the “term b3 loans” the incremental term b3 loans otherwise feature the same principal terms as the previously drawn term b3 loans including an interest rate of onemonth libor subject to a floor of 050 plus 200 per annum and a maturity date of february 2028 the proceeds of the incremental term b3 loans after payment of the offering fees and expenses were used in part to fund a portion of the consideration paid at the closing of the bettera wellness acquisition 

the sixth amendment also provided for incremental revolving credit commitments under the revolving credit facility the applicable rate for all loans drawn under the revolving credit facility is onemonth libor plus 225 and such rate can be reduced to onemonth libor plus 200 in future periods based on a measure of operating companys total leverage ratio the maturity date for the revolving credit facility is may 17 2024

the availability of capacity under the revolving credit facility is reduced by the aggregate value of all outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement as of june 30 2022 we had 721 million of unutilized capacity under the revolving credit facility due to 4 million of outstanding letters of credit

interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities in february 2021 we replaced one interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na with another and each acts or acted as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variableinterest obligation associated with our us dollardenominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on future interest expense the applicable rate for the us dollardenominated term loan under the credit agreement was onemonth libor subject to a floor of 050 plus 200 as of june 30 2021 however as a result of the interestrate swap agreement the floating portion of the applicable rate on 500 million of the term loans was effectively fixed at 09985 as of february 2021 

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate on our investments in our foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2022 we had 874 million of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge on a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 9 derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

from time to time we may use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

we have historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variablerate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense 

in february 2021 we replaced one interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na with another and each acts or acted as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variableinterest obligation associated with our term loans under our senior secured credit facilities so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on future interest expense the applicable rate for the term loans under our credit agreement was onemonth libor subject to a floor of 050 plus 200 as of june 30 2022 however as a result of the interestrate swap agreement the floating portion of the applicable rate on 500 million of the term loans was effectively fixed at 09985 as of february 2021 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchangerate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products globally our foreigncurrency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreignexchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso and brazilian real our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars our functional currency the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency except in argentina a hyperinflationary economy where our results are measured in us dollars adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive income utilizing periodend exchange rates foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in other expense net such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

we provide a wide variety of proprietary and nonproprietary differentiated technologies products and service offerings to our customers across our development and manufacturing platforms which we have advanced and grown over more than 90 years through internal development strategic alliances inlicensing and acquisitions we initially introduced our softgel capsule technologies in the 1930s and have continuously expanded our range of offerings in recent years we have launched more than a dozen internally developed new technology platform offerings we have also augmented our portfolio through acquisitions among the technologies we currently offer are softgel capsules including both gelatin and nongelatin formulations our zydis orally disintegrating tablets protein production using advanced mammalian cell lines adenoassociated virus “aav” vectors and a range of other oral injectable and respiratory delivery technologies the technologies and service offerings within our development solution platforms span the full drug development process ranging from our optiform

history 

we trace our history to the 1933 founding of the rp scherer corporation which developed the first rotary die machine for the manufacture of soft gelatin capsules and assumed our current form in april 2007 we regularly review our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan and as a result we have sold nine businesses and consolidated operations at six facilities since fiscal 2007 integrating them into the remaining facility network in fiscal 2021 we sold our facility in woodstock illinois and initiated a plan to close our facility in bolton uk we have also actively acquired new businesses and facilities in fiscal 2021 alone we closed six acquisitions and signed an agreement to acquire rheincell therapeutics gmbh a developer and manufacturer of ipscs in july 2014 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock which is listed on the new york stock exchange the “nyse” under the symbol “ctlt”

our competitive strengths 

available stateoftheart manufacturing capacity in attractive market segments 

we have invested several billion dollars over the last few years and plan to continue to invest to broaden our portfolio of offerings and expand our capacity with stateoftheart development and manufacturing capabilities that focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of the evolving biopharmaceutical and consumer health industries in addition we have hired and trained thousands of new direct manufacturing associates in our rigorous qualityfocused culture of operational excellence the capacity and capabilities we have built and purchased have enabled and our further planned expansions will continue to enable us to secure along with our operational and quality excellence attractive new business opportunities in the expanding market for outsourced product development and supply 

vibrant patient first driven culture 

from the manufacturing line to the executive suite for all our critical decisions we ask the question “what would the impact be to the patient” and our culture is built on our cornerstone value of patient first  we believe this mindset which aligns closely with our customers’ values enables a pervasive focus on patient safety impact and outcomes and an uncompromising approach to product quality and compliance by reminding us of those who depend upon our vigilance concerning the safety quality reliability and sustainability of our product supply along with other key cultural strengths including our commitments to diversity and inclusion and to sciencebased environmental sustainability we believe our culture brings us both a unique reputation and an operating capability that is difficult to replicate 

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our broad range of product and service offerings our geographic scope our large customer portfolio the extensive range of products we produce and our ability to provide solutions at every stage of a product’s lifecycle in fiscal 2021 we produced nearly 7000 distinct products across multiple categories our fiscal 2021 net 

revenue was distributed as follows proteinbased biologics and cell and gene therapies 52 branded drugs 33 generic prescription drugs 4 overthecounter drugs 6 and consumer health veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics 5 combined in fiscal 2021 our top 20 products represented approximately 38 of our total net revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of net revenue and with no individual product greater than 8 we serve more than 1000 customers in approximately 80 countries with 38 of our fiscal 2021 net revenue coming from outside the us this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to the risks associated with potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payerdriven pricing pressures experienced by our drug and biologic customers 

longstanding extensive relationships with a diverse customer portfolio 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2021 we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 23 of the top 25 generics marketers 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 17 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally as well as with more than 1000 other customers including emerging and specialty biotech and pharmaceutical companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs 

we believe our customers value us because our broad range of product and service offerings expanding capacity in stateoftheart manufacturing facilities including facilities offering new treatment modalities reliable supply geographic reach commitment to operational and quality excellence and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers 

deep broad and growing advanced technology foundation 

ou r breadth of offerings employing advanced technologies and stateoftheart manufacturing systems and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants our leading softgel platforms including liquigels optishell and vegicaps capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family of orally disintegrating tablets our spray drying capabilities and our optipact and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via oral respiratory and injectable routes and also provide advanced biologics formulation options including gpex gpex boost and gpex lightning mammalian cell lines for protein production smartag adc technology aav vectors for cell and gene therapies and plasmid dna manufacturing we have a leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and intranasal forms we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced technologies over the last three years as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications including the launch of spraydry dispersion and recently purchased or expanded our businesses developing and manufacturing proteinbased biologic medicines fill and finish for injectable drugs and biologics cell and gene therapy offerings and other new therapeutic and other modalities our culture of creativity problemsolving and innovation is grounded in our advanced technologies the substantial expertise and experience of our scientists and engineers and in some cases our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes our global product development and innovation teams drive a focused application of resources to opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development  as of june 30 2021 we had nearly 1400 product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield safe and effective final formulations and dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years see “— contractual arrangements ” for more detail approximately threequarters of our fiscal 2021 net revenue from our product development and delivery offerings and related services offered through our biologics softgel and oral technologies and oral and specialty delivery reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage

we have made over time and expect to continue to make significant investments in our manufacturing network which is capable of serving customers and patients worldwide and today employ approximately 7 million square feet of manufacturing 

laboratory and related space across four continents we have deployed approximately 17 billion in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures not including more than 30 billion spent in acquiring new facilities and businesses growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand including in gene and cell therapies and other new treatment modalities and fill and finish for injectable biologics through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive continuous improvements in safety productivity sustainability and reliable supply which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery sustainability and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  “ cgmp ”  or other applicable requirements following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have approximately 1600 employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance all of our facilities are registered where required with the fda or other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency the “ema” in many cases our facilities are registered with multiple food drug or biologics regulatory agencies around the world in fiscal 2021 we were subject to 52 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed approximately 300 regulatory audits we also undergo more than 500 customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a favorable competitive differentiator 

strong and experienced management team 

our executive leadership team collectively has approximately 600 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of approximately 28 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships 

our strategy 

our strategic ambition guided by and operationalized through our values is to power the innovation and growth of the life science industry by becoming its leading development and commercial partner in reliable supply advanced technologies firsttoscale innovation integrated solutions and new therapeutic modalities to achieve this we continue to pursue the following key growth initiatives 

“ follow the molecule ” ® by providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to continue to use our development and manufacturing solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for early preclinical development of small molecules proteinbased biologics and cell and gene therapies through formulation and analytical services development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies and fill and finish of injectable products to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for clinical trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced technologies and expert stateoftheart manufacturing solutions that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in safe effective and in some cases attractive dosage forms and to produce biologics drug substances needed for proteinbased biologics and cell and gene therapies our relationship with a molecule typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product and can extend throughout the molecule’s commercial life for prescription products we are typically the sole or primary outsourced provider and are frequently reflected in customers’ product approval applications our revenues from our development and manufacturing activities are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of an innovator drug’s market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply customers offering generic or biosimilar equivalents 

an example of the long and mutually productive relationships we foster can be found in a leading overthecounter antiallergy brand which today uses both our zydis orally disintegrating tablets and our liquigels softgel technology we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription product in our zydis orally disintegrating tablet format for six years and we have continued to provide the zydis form since the switch to overthecounter status in the us and other markets in the early 2000s subsequently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 29yearlong relationship across multiple formats and markets 

customer product pipeline — continuing to grow through new projects and product launches 

we intend to continue to supplement our existing diverse base of commercialized customer products with new development programs as of june 30 2021 our product development teams were working on nearly 1400 active customer development programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our expanded capabilities and technology platforms although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical proteinbased biologic cell and gene therapy and consumer health products we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in fiscal 2021 we introduced 139 new products for our customers 

catalent continues to be a leader in providing chemistry manufacturing and controlsbased product development services to the global pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health industries driven by thousands of projects annually in fiscal 2021 we recognized 176 billion of net revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers in our biologics softgel and oral technologies and oral and specialty delivery reporting segments up 73 from the prior year in addition substantially all of the revenue associated with the clinical supply services segment relates to our support of customer products in development 

capabilities  capacity — expanding in biologics and other attractive markets 

recognizing the strategic importance of proteinbased biologics cell and gene therapies plasmid dna and other newer biopharmaceutical modalities we began to build a differentiated biologics platform in 2002 since 2016 we have invested over 37 billion in our biologics business including capital investments and approximately 26 billion for acquisitions of biologicsfocused businesses and sites today we are a recognized leader in biologics including aav vectors for gene therapies development and supply for cell therapies advanced cellline development formulation and fillfinish into vials prefilled syringes and cartridges specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substances and bioanalytical analysis we have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for more than 700 cell lines many using our advanced gpex and gpex boost technologies and have actively collaborated on developing and scaling up more than 100 cell and gene therapies we have also invested in a secondgeneration adc technology smartag and we see continued progress in our customers’ smartag productdevelopment activities 

in addition to our expansion in biologics we have invested additional capital in several other existing facilities in order to expand in attractive markets including a significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in winchester kentucky and the scalingup of commercial manufacturing capacity for metereddose inhalers and our nextgeneration orally disintegrating tablet  “odt”  technology zydis ultra we have also added specialized new capabilities and capacity in early development over the last several fiscal years we expanded our capacity for oral and injectable products via our fiscal 2020 acquisition of a facility in anagni italy and for north american consumer health softgels via our fiscal 2017 acquisition of two facilities in ontario canada 

use our proprietary technologies and substantial expertise to help our customers develop new products 

we have broad and diverse technology platforms that are supported by deep scientific expertise extensive knowhow and more than 1300 patents and patent applications in approximately 158 families across advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation knowhow databases of formulated products and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result approximately 90 of approvals by the fda over the last 25 years of new chemical entities presented in a softgel format have been developed and supplied by us 

in addition to resolving delivery challenges for our customers’ products for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proofofconcept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for selfcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

operational leverage — deploy existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our active focus on continuous improvement and sustainability enhancement global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of 

functional excellence and cost accountability along with the ongoing increase in the share of revenues from higher margin biologics offerings we expect this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2016 we have expanded gross margin by 200 basis points and adjusted ebitda margin by over 300 basis points note that “adjusted ebitda” is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the us  “ us gaap ”  and that further explanations of this measure and comparisons to the most directly comparable us gaap measures are set forth below at “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—nongaap metrics ” 

strategic acquisitions and licensing — build on our existing platform 

we operate in the markets for outsourced development solutions and commercial supply where we estimate current spending at roughly 600 billion globally our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer portfolio provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets to enter new markets and generate operating leverage through acquisitions since fiscal 2013 we have executed 18 transactions investing more than 32 billion and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

while we are rigorously focused on driving our organic growth we have in recent years substantially increased our participation in biologics including proteinbased biologics cell and gene therapies plasmid dna production and drug product fill and finish via strategydriven inorganic transactions we intend to continue opportunistically to source and execute strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within emerging treatment modalities new geographic markets or related market segments we have a dedicated corporate development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions

integrated development and product supply chain solutions 

in addition to our proprietary offerings we are also differentiated in the market by our ability to bring together our development solutions and stateoftheart product manufacturing to offer integrated development and product supply solutions that can be combined or tailored in many ways to enable our customers to take their drugs biologics and consumer health products from laboratory to market faster once a product is on the market we can provide comprehensive integrated product supply from the sourcing or supply of the bulk active ingredient to comprehensive manufacturing and packaging to the testing required for release and to coldchain or ambient temperature distribution the customer and productspecific solutions we develop are flexible scalable and creative so that they meet the unique needs of both large and emerging biopharma and consumer health companies and are appropriate for products of all sizes we believe that our development and product supply solutions such as optiform solution suite and onebio suite will continue to contribute to our future growth 

sales and marketing 

our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and consumer health companies along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices and companies in adjacent industries such as cosmetics we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2021 we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 23 of the top 25 generics marketers 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 17 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally as well as with more than 1000 other customers faced with access pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities while reducing their fixed cost bases many midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies while facing the same pricing and market pressures have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills technologies and services required to bring their products to market consumer health companies require rapidly developed innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up with the fastpaced overthecounter medication dietary supplement and personal care markets these market segments are all important to our growth but require distinct solutions marketing and sales approaches and market strategy 

we follow a hybrid demandgeneration organization model with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering our sales organization currently consists of approximately 170 fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings as part of our marketing efforts we participate in major trade shows relevant to our offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and universe of target customers and that our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us 

global accounts 

we manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential we recorded approximately 31 of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 from these global accounts each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization as well as operational quality and project management personnel to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally and account for more than twothirds of the active drug and biologic development pipeline historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to 

formulate develop analyze test and manufacture their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe central and south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of these customers 

seasonality fluctuations in operation results 

our annual financial reporting periods end on june 30 excluding the impact from covid19 in fiscal 2021 as discussed further in item 7 — managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in the us and europe the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses quality and confidentiality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice unit pricing in one or more tiers minimum volume commitments royalties manufacturing preparation services profitsharing and fixed fees we generally secure pricing and other contract mechanisms in our supply agreements to allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements permit us to raise or renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials we use to make products our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions the terms of our manufacturing supply agreements range from three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our softgel and oral technologies biologics and oral and specialty delivery segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our clinical supply services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2021 our backlog was 3767 million compared to 2282 million as of june 30 2020 including 501 million and 425 million respectively related to our clinical supply services segment we expect to recognize as revenue approximately 50 of the value of the backlog in existence as of june 30 2021 by the end of fiscal 2022 

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period or that involve minimum volume commitments we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers which often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns the matters discussed in this paragraph and other factors our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world as of june 30 2021 we had 56 facilities 45 geographical locations operate as multiple facilities because they support more than one reporting segment with one location including both a manufacturing facility and our corporate headquarters on four continents with approximately 7 million square feet of manufacturing laboratory office and related space our manufacturing capabilities generally include the full suite of competencies relevant to the support of each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

we operate our manufacturing facilities and development centers in accordance with cgmp or other applicable requirements all of these sites are registered where required with the fda or other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases our sites are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested 137 billion in our manufacturing and development facilities since fiscal 2019 for improvements and expansions including 686 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 we believe that our sites and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2021 we achieved approximately 96 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including lean six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for our softgel and oral technologies segment packaging films for our clinical supply services segment singleuse production components for our biologics segment drug substance production and glass vials and syringes for biologics drug product the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics or geopolitical and other issues for example commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy  “ bse ”  have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers any future restriction that were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval periods 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process since regulators usually must approve changes to prescription product ingredient sources although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see “ risk factors—risks relating to our business and the industry in which we operate— our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials ” in addition the covid19 pandemic may interfere with the operations of certain of our direct or indirect suppliers or with international trade for these supplies which may either raise our costs or reduce the productivity or slow the timing of our operations 

competition 

we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including with other companies that offer conventional and advanced technologies for the development supply and delivery of medicinal products clinical trials support outsourced dose form proteinbased biologics or cell or gene therapy manufacturing or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america central and south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have access to more substantial resources which could be deployed to expand their range of offerings or capacity 

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant capabilities consistency of operational performance availability of equipment quality price value responsiveness and speed while we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings and a few competitors that compete across many of our offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable company 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements research and development costs amounted to 21 million 21 million and 19 million for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

employees 

as of june 30 2021 we had nearly 17300 individuals providing services to us at 56 facilities on 4 continents of which certain employees at one of our 24 us facilities are represented by a labor union with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement some combination of national works councils labor unions and other labor organizations is active at all 19 of our european facilities consistent with labor environments and laws in european countries similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist at our plants in argentina brazil and canada our management believes that our relations with our workforce are satisfactory most of our individual service providers are fulltime employees while slightly more than 1400 of our workers as of june 30 2021 are contingent workers who are either selfemployed or employed by external services organizations

our primary goal is to develop our people from within thereby establishing a strong successor bench to help support company growth in fiscal 2021 over 2500 employees moved to a new role within the organization whether as a developmental move or a promotion to a more senior position our senior leaders are committed to talent development and dedicate time each fiscal quarter to perform formalized talent reviews to discuss the development of key talent and to update succession plans for critical roles 

we strongly believe that the combination of experience 70 exposure 20 and education 10 is the best recipe for personal development and career progression here we have a library of tools and resources available for our employees within that framework 

we also offer three formal development programs to employees all three programs provide excellent opportunities to identify internal candidates who can fill critical leadership and other roles with us at different levels through these programs we have created a bench of leaders who model our values and are ready to take on more responsibility 

1 entrylevel gold program the gold program is a twoyear rotational program for recent graduates from universities around the world in which the employee participates in three rotations at different sites in our network to learn about us and our varied offerings gold employees receive assignments to perform strategic roles in key business initiatives we provide them with coaching and opportunities to interact with senior executives which both develop the skills and experience of our gold employees and provide a platform through which they contribute fresh ideas that challenge the status quo

diversity and inclusion 

an overarching di commitment drives our decisions policies and leadership practices we are committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating fostering and advancing a culture of equality and inclusion enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to our continued success our commitment to these values starts at the top with a diverse board of directors and an executive management team that represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives in fiscal 2018 we established our global office of diversity  inclusion the “di office” which oversees our di efforts globally the di office is supported by regional di committees composed of leaders at a variety of levels who oversee the implementation of local programs 

our di aspirations span the following four focus areas culture people community and marketplace we aim to 

• foster an inclusive culture where every employee feels welcomed valued and respected establishing an environment that supports employees in their careers and in their personal lives 

• prioritize recruitment and promotion strategies that create a strong representative balance at all levels of the organization 

• deliver development programs that promote equitable career flows and compensation for all employees 

• execute rapid scaleup of foundational inclusive leadership and unconscious bias training for all employees especially our leaders 

• enable the recognition and advancement of underserved communities through partnerships with external organizations and 

• advance di outside of our walls by understanding the needs of our diverse customers implementing a robust supplier diversity program and providing philanthropic support to organizations that serve diverse groups 

engagement 

our employeefocused practices have had a clear impact on our employee engagement through increased engagement we can grow our business by relying on strong engaged leaders and professionals willing to ensure we can overcome and thrive during any challenge 

we periodically administer a companywide engagement survey to garner direct feedback from our employees regarding how we can more deeply and meaningfully engage them enabling us to focus on improving specific areas where we can support our people in our most recent engagement survey completed in fiscal 2021 our employee engagement score improved by 10 points overall compared to the immediately prior survey taken two years earlier with the most important improvements among the senior leadership and manager employee populations and a notable increase in engagement as a result of our enhanced rewards and recognition programs 

our covid19 response 

we have adapted our processes and policies during the covid19 pandemic in order to support our employees customers and our local communities 

we recognize that we have a unique responsibility to help respond to the covid19 pandemic and are committed to supporting and protecting our employees and their families ensuring that our supply of covid19 related products and our other lifesaving and lifeenhancing products reach patients contributing our scientific expertise to the development of covid19 treatments and vaccines and supporting health care providers and the communities in which they serve we kept our employees safe and feeling protected by using the bestavailable expertise to modify our process flows and people movement employing masks physical barriers and physical distancing to minimize exposure we communicated regularly with our leaders and operating personnel regarding our actions and motivations to assure transparency and the incorporation of useful suggestions from every level of the organization 

in fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021 we implemented new virtual recruitment platforms and streamlined procedures to accelerate onboarding amid rapidly changing local restrictions we sought to ensure the safety of new hires through training on our covid19 protocols and requiring covid19 tests for those working onsite when permissible under local regulations we continue to provide employees with easy and regular access to information including details regarding our covid19 tracking process guidance around hygiene measures and travel and best practices for working from home we also provided extensive information to support our employees as they made vaccination decisions and provided paid time off for employees to get vaccinated and paid time off if vaccination resulted in side effects 

as a result of our actions 92 of employees responding to our covid19 survey in fiscal 2021 expressed the view that we are demonstrating care and concern for our employees through our actions and policies 

corporate responsibility and our environmental social and governance “esg” strategy 

our mission to help people live better healthier lives drives our culture and inspires us to us corporate responsibility “cr” starts with our nearly 17300 workers who live our patient first culture and work to deliver on our responsibility to timely develop and reliably supply products to patients whether for a potential covid19 vaccine or treatment or the more than 70 billion doses we produce every year on behalf of our customers and their patients 

in the wake of significant change and uncertainty during the covid19 pandemic we focused on the critical importance of our mission and values to orient us we prioritized people and patients in our decisions as we adapted rapidly to meet the needs of an everevolving pandemic our response to the covid19 pandemic for our employees and for our customers and global community coupled with our focus on social justice have made us stronger and more cohesive we connected even 

more deeply with our employees and communities executed with excellence under stress and kept our people safe while accelerating our services talents and capabilities to serve our customers and their patients 

our cr strategy which includes our strategy related to esg matters is integrated into our companywide strategic plan ensuring that we operate in alignment with our values meet our commitments to all our stakeholders and contribute to the longterm success of the broader pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries and the communities where we operate we continue to invest in a corporate culture that understands and prioritizes our impact on people in our daily operations and decisionmaking strategies 

our approach to esg focuses on three areas of society relevant to our business prioritizing our impact on people the environment and our communities we focus on esg areas that are the most significant to our business and our strategy is informed by our employees customers investors communities and other key stakeholders 

we established the office of corporate responsibility in fiscal 2017 and created a formal governance structure through our cr council which guides the implementation of our esg strategy and now reports on a regular cadence to our board of directors we continuously assess the maturity and performance of our cr programs at each of our operating segments and sites through a scorecard system our leaders are held accountable for our cr goals including those focused on strengthening our environmental and social efforts 

governance 

we are committed to ensuring strong corporate governance practices on behalf of our shareholders and other stakeholders we believe strong corporate governance and an independent board of directors provide the foundation for financial integrity and shareholder confidence more information about our corporate governance features can be found in our proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders the “ proxy statement ”  which will be filed within 120 days after june 30 2021 the close of our fiscal year covered by this annual report 

in addition as noted above we have established a cr council composed of senior leaders from various parts of our business to guide our cr efforts and set our overall cr strategy our board of directors regularly reviews aspects of our cr strategy and performance as a full board and through its several committees including an annual review of our overall cr strategy and performance 

business benefits 

beyond being the right thing to do our focus on cr strengthens our business by reducing risks meeting customer and investor expectations and attracting top talent cr performance is an important contributor to our business success it informs our risk management process protects our reputation and alerts us to regulatory environmental and societal threats to our business our cr activities also align with many of our customers’ cr programs and strengthens our relationships with our customers 

our future success depends on our highly skilled and dedicated global workforce who are passionate about improving health outcomes we compete for talent in our industry and recognize that our culture and reputation as a responsible company can be a differentiator in attracting candidates and retaining our employees according to the last two engagement surveys we conducted di and cr are two of the highestrated engagement elements of our culture while we are transparent about the progress we still need to make our commitment energizes our employees and makes them proud 

our customers and our investors regularly ask us to join them in their own esg commitments especially in the areas of environmental sustainability and di reflected in the increasing number of business reviews and surveys dedicated to our esg commitments and progress we understand that our stakeholders want to know that we share their values our esg strategy drives us to provide concrete evidence of our commitment to our esg values which strengthens our relationships with customers and other stakeholders 

esg progress in fiscal 2021 

we made significant progress in several esg focus areas in fiscal 2021 

in may 2021 we published our second annual cr report informed by the requirements of the sustainability accounting standards board sasb for biotechnology and pharmaceuticals and covering esg issues that include quality safety innovation environmental sustainability and climate change di and community investment and philanthropy the cr report which covers our fiscal year 2020 describes how we extended and deepened our cr commitments as part of our longterm corporate strategy some of our highlighted progress includes 

• the development of our first human rights statement and commencement of a thirdparty assessment a critical element of our emerging responsible supply chain initiative that aims to align our 10000plus suppliers with our industry’s standards for responsible reliable and sustainable partnership 

• our commitment to new targets for waste and water reduction including our pledge to ensure that none of our sites discharge wastewater with api concentrations above predicted no effect concentrations pnecs which standards often exceed current regulatory requirements 

• the transition of six more sites to 100 renewable electricity for a total of 12 sites with 100 renewable electricity a number that will continue to grow and as of july 1 2021 covered 97 of our electricity usage across our global network and 

• our largestever fiscal year philanthropic contribution total with a substantial portion of our gifts focused on our response to the interconnected covid19 and social inequality crises 

over the past year we further integrated our employee resource groups “ergs” into our diverse talent acquisition and talent development efforts ergs are groups of volunteer employees who join together based on shared characteristics or life experiences and serve as a resource for talent development employee engagement enhancing a sense of belonging informing others in the company regarding their unique challenges perspectives and achievements and fostering a diverse inclusive workplace aligned with organizational goals 

we also deepened the relationships we have with potential sources of talent and other hr providers to continue to enhance our diverse talent recruitment engagement and development initiatives 

we share our global gender statistics and us ethnicity statistics in our cr report we are transparent about the progress made and the work still to be done in these areas of focus 

looking ahead 

as a leader in a growing industry we understand the need to demonstrate our shared commitment sense of urgency and value in contributing to the responsibility and longterm sustainability of the entire pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries we continue to progress against our sustainability responsible supply chain human rights and di goals and plan for future progress in these focus areas 

this is especially true for environmental sustainability in fiscal 2021 we achieved our current carbon reduction commitment and are now setting new sciencebased scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction targets in alignment with global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change effective july 1 2021 97 of our electricity usage across our global network is procured from renewable energy sources such as wind solar hydro and biomass we will purchase renewable energy certificates recs for all of our sites operating in north america south america and europe as well as the majority of its sites in asia 

our chair and ceo also recently signed a letter of commitment with the sciencebased target initiative adding us to a growing list of companies setting actionable sciencebased greenhouse gas “ghg” emission reduction targets to limit global warming this commitment will include calculating and reducing direct and indirect emissions even as we continue to evolve and grow sourcing the majority of our electricity from renewable sources will contribute to our overall ghg reduction efforts and is a milestone step towards doing our part in the global community and meeting our sbt commitment we will publicize our new ghg reduction targets in our next fiscal 2021 cr report our scope 3 targets will take longer to assess and establish 

as part of our emerging “responsible supplier’ initiative we will implement recommendations from our current human rights assessment in line with the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights we will require our key direct material suppliers to complete a selfassessment that includes questions on ethics and labor and will rate them for human rights risks based on the quality of the selfassessments their country of operation type of business and information in the public domain additionally select suppliers will be subject to ongoing monitoring for human rights risk violations under our thirdparty vetting and due diligence program 

finally measuring against our baseline di statistics we are progressing on our goal to recruit more diverse talent especially in leadership roles through training hosting internal forums and establishing internal performance metrics we are counteracting the unconscious bias that too often blinds us from hiring and promoting the diverse talent available to us employee surveys tell us that our people are energized and engaged by our cr and di initiatives therefore in addition to 

closing critical talent gaps we aim to continue to inspire and motivate our people even more in our journey towards a more diverse and inclusive catalent

 item 1a risk factors 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and the industry in which we operate 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic 

any public health epidemic including the covid19 pandemic may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely including our customers and suppliers our business financial condition and results of operations may be affected by disruptions in our customers’ abilities to fund develop or bring to market products as anticipated delays in or disruptions to the conduct of clinical trials cancellations of contracts or confirmed orders from our customers decreased demand for categories of products in certain affected regions and inability difficulty or additional cost or delays in obtaining key raw materials components and other supplies from our existing supply chain among other factors caused by a public health epidemic including the covid19 pandemic 

while the covid19 pandemic has not had a material negative effect on our overall business financial condition or results of operations to date our customers and suppliers have in some cases experienced negative impacts due to disruptions in supply chains and disruptions to the operations of the fda and other drug regulatory authorities which resulted in among other things delays of inspections reviews and approvals of our customers’ products as well as the volume and timing of orders from these customers such impacts may affect our business in the future governmental restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic which continue to evolve including travel restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders business closures new safety requirements or regulations or restrictions on the import or export of certain materials or other operational issues related to the covid19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we continue to monitor developments related to the covid19 pandemic and its effects on our business operations and financial condition for purposes of our operational and financial planning we have made and update when appropriate certain assumptions regarding the duration severity and global economic impact of the pandemic in different regions and the need for continued manufacture and supply of covid19 vaccines and treatments each of which remains uncertain however despite careful planning our assumptions may not be accurate as the extent to which covid19 may affect our future results will depend on future developments that are uncertain including the duration of the pandemic emerging information concerning the severity and incidence of the virus and its variants the emergence of additional virus variants regional resurgences of the virus globally the safety efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments for covid19 including its variants the rate at which the population globally becomes vaccinated against covid19 the global economic impact of the pandemic the actions of governments and regulatory authorities to contain the pandemic or control the supply of vaccines and treatments and the actions the pharmaceutical industry competitors suppliers customers patients and others may take to contain or address the pandemic’s direct and indirect effects 

we have seen revenue increases and the potential for further revenue increases in some of our reporting segments particularly our biologics segment resulting from the testing manufacturing and packaging of covid19related products for our customers while this positive impact is expected to continue through at least the remainder of calendar 2021 and into 2022 the duration and extent of future revenues from such testing manufacturing and packaging of covid19related products is uncertain and dependent upon customer demand see also —risks related to our business and the industry in which we operate— the continually evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting public health response including the changing demand for various covid19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world may affect sales of the covid19 products we manufacture 

in addition the impact of the covid19 pandemic or any other public health epidemic could exacerbate other risks we face including those described elsewhere in risk factors 

the continually evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting public health response including the changing demand for various covid19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world may affect sales of the covid19 products we manufacture 

we manufacture or provide services for a variety of products intended for the prevention or treatment of covid19 and its symptoms and effects including the manufacture of bulk drug substance for one vaccine fill and finish services for other vaccines packaging and distribution services and the manufacture of excipients used in a covid19 treatment no single one 

of these products is material to our business several of these products are subject to “takeorpay” provisions that require the customer to either purchase a minimum amount of product or pay any shortfall resulting from purchases not made such provisions mitigate risks relating to any future uncertainty in the demand for these products 

all of the covid19related products we develop and manufacture have yet to receive full regulatory approval from any regulatory authority although some are being marketed and sold pursuant to an emergency use authorization eua from the fda or the equivalent authorization from nonus regulatory authorities should one or more of these covid19related products be denied an eua or equivalent or be denied full regulatory approval by the fda or other major nonus regulatory authority the demand for such products could decrease significantly and therefore decrease customer orders for additional development manufacturing or packaging of those products although the financial effect on us may be mitigated by any takeorpay provision in place with respect to that product additionally the need for continued manufacture and supply of vaccines including potential “booster” doses and therapies to address the covid19 pandemic including new and developing variants of covid19 is highly uncertain and subject to various political economic and regulatory factors that are outside of our control should the us or other major regions worldwide determine that additional manufacture of covid19 vaccines boosters or therapies is no longer necessary it could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition and our ability to grow our business in the near term in addition highlypublic political and social debate relating to the need for efficacy of or side effects related to one or more specific covid19 vaccines could contribute to changes in public perception of one or more covid19 vaccines manufactured by us which could decrease demand for a covid19 related product we develop manufacture or package 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities in addition customer spending may be affected by among other things the covid19 pandemic or recessionary economic conditions caused in whole or in part by the pandemic 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings available resources the need to develop new products and consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers for these reasons or because of the direct or indirect effects of the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including competing with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing clinical trials support services or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies globally we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally 

we face substantial competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed some competitors have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with strategic acquisitions or with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customers’ requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could exceed our anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits 

which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits even those without merit could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities adverse publicity and diversion of management’s time attention and resources 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 25 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability or other claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements including changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers in addition changes to our procedures or additional procedures implemented to comply with public health orders or best practice guidelines as a result of the covid19 pandemic may increase our costs or reduce our productivity and thereby affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we and our customers are subject to various local state federal national and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs similar bodies of the uk the eu and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world and in the future any change to such laws and regulations or the interpretation or application thereof could adversely affect us among other rules affecting us we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cgmp and drug safety as a result of the covid19 pandemic new public health orders or best practice guidelines may increase our costs to operate or reduce our productivity thereby affecting our business financial condition or results of operations 

failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations or requests from regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals permits or registrations including those relating to products or facilities in addition any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical or medical device must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal national and transnational regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions that regulate our offerings and products 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us or our customers with applicable law or regulation or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore loss of a permit license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock and may subject us to regulatory action or costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our workforce with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings and despite our network of quality systems a quality or safety issue including with respect to a highrevenue product such as a covid19 vaccine or therapy could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition stock price or results of operations and may subject us to regulatory action including a product recall product seizure injunction to halt manufacture or distribution or restriction on our operations monetary fines or other civil or criminal sanctions in addition such an issue could subject us to 

adverse publicity and costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses the cost of which could be significant 

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our biologics softgel and oral technologies and oral and specialty delivery segments due in part to complex and exacting manufacturing processes and strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses time and expense spent investigating the cause lost production time and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation the risks associated with running a highly complex facility doing exacting work with substantial regulatory oversight are enhanced for our larger sites like our bloomington indiana harmans maryland st petersburg florida or swindon uk sites which generally generate much more revenue 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological advances our services may become uncompetitive or obsolete and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies to the extent that such technologies are protected by patents their related offerings may become subject to competition as the patents expire without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings and technologies our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not obtain access to the innovations or have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations 

even if we succeed in creating or acquiring enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks knowhow trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect many of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will provide uniqueness or meaningful competitive differentiation in our offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur which may force us to compete with third parties thereby negatively affecting our revenue and profitability 

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of such proceedings may be unfavorable to us any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

there can be no assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

while we continue to apply in the us and certain other countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks there can be no assurance that third parties will not oppose our applications in the future in addition it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the us or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

license agreements with third parties control our rights to use certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies owned by third parties some of which are important to our business termination of these license agreements for any reason could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property causing an adverse change in our operations or the inability to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the us for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents if the patents on which our customers rely were successfully challenged and as a result the affected products become subject to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings 

our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and certain other countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claim that our offerings or processes infringe thirdparty intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of the claim’s merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters if any such claim results in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages in the us cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing offerings or processes discontinue the use of the infringing technology expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology license technology from the third party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all and lose the opportunity 

to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others 

in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

events that diminish tarnish or otherwise damage our brand may have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have built a strong brand in “catalent” with high overall and generally favorable awareness of the brand in our established markets and with target customers our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us in sales and marketing which is evidenced by our customer mix among top branded drug generics biologics and consumer health marketers we have spent and continue to spend substantial time money and other resources to establish both our brand awareness and a favorable perception of our brand in relevant markets among other strategies we participate in major international trade shows in our established markets and ensure visibility into our offerings through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program it is possible that a single event or aggregation of several events may diminish tarnish or otherwise damage our brand and adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations 

for example meaningful interruptions to our ability to reliably supply one or more customers with products on time whether as a result of supply chain disruptions or manufacturing delays or defects may diminish our customers’ confidence in our ability to timely meet our commitments thereby damaging our brand in addition we are subject to various local state federal national and transnational laws and regulations including the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea and similar bodies of the uk the eu and other comparable agencies around the world highly public or significant negative reports or findings from a regulatory agency with respect to one or more manufacturing or quality defects in our operations inspections of our facilities or other routine reviews could cause negative public perception of our operations negatively impacting our brand and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations in addition many of the other risks we face including those described elsewhere in risk factors could diminish tarnish or otherwise damage our brand 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials in addition the covid19 pandemic may interfere with the operations of certain of our direct or indirect suppliers or with international trade for these supplies which may either raise our costs or reduce the productivity or slow the timing of our operations 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by third parties for our offerings our customers also frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product and may supply other raw materials as well it is possible that any of our or our customers’ supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements import or export restrictions natural disasters international supply disruptions including those caused by public health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic geopolitical issues operational or quality issues at the suppliers’ facilities and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin a critical component for our softgel and oral technologies segment is available from only a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative material could be subject to lengthy and uncertain formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for or public sentiment towards our customers’ products in the united states or internationally or other changes in applicable policies regarding the healthcare industry could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by affecting demand for our offerings 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform including with respect to reforming drug pricing adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings that they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for these offerings in particular it is possible that future legislation in the us may affect or put a cap on future pricing of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products while we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to us and other international laws affecting pharmaceutical and biotechnology products any substantial revision of applicable healthcare legislation could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers’ products which in turn could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or business changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices or in public or government sentiment for the industry as a whole could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we generated net operating losses “nols” in the past that have been and continue to be used to reduce taxable income utilization of our nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code ”  and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the internal revenue code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an “ ownership change ” generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange nols to reduce its postchange income may be limited in addition we acquired companies that generated preacquisition nols for tax purposes that will also be subject to limitation under section 382 and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our prechange nol carryforwards to reduce us federal state local and foreign taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

changes to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net deferred tax assets 

we have deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets and certain foreign net deferred tax assets it is possible we may experience a decline in us taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some additional portion or all our deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new and enhanced offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel or a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on more than 150 senior employees to lead and direct our business our senior leadership team is comprised of our subsidiaries’ executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market 

we employ more than 2500 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery biologics and gene and cell therapy formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are 

located in competitive labor markets therefore global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

we may acquire businesses and offerings that complement or expand our business or divest nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete desired transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom the failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations and profitability 

our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities or divest assets or an ongoing business we face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration we or the purchaser of a divested asset or business may not be able to complete a desired transaction for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing 

any acquisition that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies which may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing desired divestitures we may have to expend cash incur debt or continue to absorb the costs of lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestiture whether we complete it or not may involve numerous risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with maintaining its business during the disposition process and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring remaining portions of the operations of the business to other facilities 

cell and gene therapies are relatively new modes of treatment and subject to changing public opinion continuing research and increased regulatory scrutiny each of which may affect our customers’ abilities to conduct their business or obtain approvals for their therapies and thereby adversely affect our cell or gene therapy offerings 

cell and gene therapy remain relatively new means for treating disease and other medical conditions with only a few cell and gene therapies approved to date in the us the eu or elsewhere public perception may be influenced by claims that cell or gene therapies are unsafe and cell or gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community in addition ethical social legal and costbenefit concerns about cell or gene therapy genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or limitations or even outright prohibitions on certain cell or gene therapies or related products various regulatory and legislative bodies have expressed an interest in or have taken steps towards further regulation of various biotechnologies including cell and gene therapies more restrictive regulations or claims that certain cell or gene therapies are unsafe or pose a hazard could reduce our customers’ use of our services we can provide no assurance whether legislative changes will be enacted regulations policies or guidance changed or interpretations of existing strictures by agencies or courts changed or what the impact of such changes if any may be 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs or restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa osha and equivalent local state and national regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves in particular we are subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials byproducts of our manufacturing operations and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material included in our offerings and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in 

the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities facilities we acquire in the future or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded reserves we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us and such activities may result in unanticipated costs or management distraction 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we have nearly 17300 individuals providing services for us worldwide including approximately 10300 service providers in north america 5400 in europe 1000 in south america and 600 in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils or labor organizations are active at our european facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environments and laws our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities collective bargaining or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employmentrelated costs or may result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make to increase the funding level will reduce the cash available for our business such as the payment of our interest expense 

certain of our current and former employees in the us the uk germany france japan belgium and switzerland are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2021 the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was 54 million primarily related to our pension plans in the uk and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of 38 million as of june 30 2021 related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns applicable actuarial assumptions prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness 

our global operations are subject to economic and political risks which could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global and regional economic and political developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain our customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such mitigating measures may be unavailable costly or unsuccessful 

as a global enterprise fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar our reporting currency against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations 

as a company with significant operations outside of the us certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including our eurodenominated 2375 senior notes due 2028 the “2028 notes” are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar which is the currency that we use to report our financial results as a result changes in the exchange rates of these or any other applicable currency to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates affecting the various currencies in which we do business such volatility and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies 

tax legislative or regulatory initiatives new interpretations or developments concerning existing tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational enterprise with operations in the us and more than a dozen other countries across north and south america europe and the asiapacific region and we do business with suppliers and customers in many additional regions as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of many jurisdictions outside of the us from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and existing legislation may be subject to additional regulatory changes or new interpretations  there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 

in addition us federal state local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by taxing authorities could result in adverse impacts to tax years open under statute or to our operating structures currently in place it is possible that the outcomes from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by taxing authorities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations compile and analyze financial and operational data and communicate among our employees customers and counterparties and the risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations we are continuously working to install new and upgrade existing systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber security risks to enhance the protections available to us but such protections may be inadequate to address malicious attacks or inadvertent compromises of data security 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain process analyze and manage data to 

• facilitate the manufacture and distribution of thousands of inventory items in to and from our facilities 

• receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

• manage the accurate billing and collections for more than one thousand customers 

• create compile and retain testing and other product manufacturing or facilityrelated data necessary for meeting our and our customers’ regulatory obligations 

• manage the accurate accounting and payment for thousands of vendors and our employees 

• schedule and operate our global network of development manufacturing and packaging facilities 

• document various aspects of our activities including the agreements we make with suppliers and customers 

• compile financial and other operational data into reports necessary to manage our business and comply with various regulatory or contractual obligations including obligations under our bank loans and other indebtedness the federal securities laws the internal revenue code and other applicable state local and exus tax laws and communicate among our nearly 17300 workers spread across dozens of facilities over four continents 

we face various security threats on a regular basis including ongoing cyber security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure we deploy defenses against such threats and attacks and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques hardware and software typical of companies of our size and scope despite our security measures however our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by increasingly sophisticated intruders or others who try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems they are also susceptible to breach due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions our suppliers contractors service providers and other third parties with whom we do business also experience cyber threats and attacks that are similar in frequency and sophistication in many cases we have to rely on the controls and safeguards put in place by our suppliers contractors service providers and other third parties to defend against respond to and report these attacks we cannot know the potential impact of future cyber incidents which vary widely in severity and scale there can be no assurance that the various procedures and controls we utilize to mitigate these threats will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems in part because i cyberattack techniques change frequently and at times new techniques are not recognized until launched and ii cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged or fail for any extended period 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business expose us to interest 

rate risk to the extent of our variablerate debt or prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness these risks may be increased in a recessionary environment particularly as sources of capital may become less available or more expensive 

as of june 30 2021 we had 3277 million us dollar equivalent of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 997 million of secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and 2034 million of senior unsecured indebtedness including 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5000 us dollardenominated senior notes due 2027 the “2027 notes” €825 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 notes and 550 million aggregate principal amount of us dollardenominated 3125 senior notes due 2029 the “2029 notes” and together with the 2027 notes and the 2028 notes the “senior notes” we also owed 50 million representing the gross value of the remaining deferred purchase consideration related to the acquisition of cook pharmica llc now catalent indiana llc “catalent indiana” and 193 million of finance lease obligations in addition we had 719 million of unutilized capacity and 6 million of outstanding letters of credit under our 725 million secured revolving credit commitments which is part of our senior secured credit facilities the “revolving credit facility” 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest 

• exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of our eurodenominated notes 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions could result in one or more events of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness or through crossdefaults in agreements governing other indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or capital investments or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

our total interest expense net was 110 million 126 million and 111 million for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloatingrate debt including as a result of our february 2021 interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na and assuming that our revolving credit facility is undrawn and libor is above any applicable minimum floor each change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in a change of approximately 5 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries are still capable of incurring significant additional debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition as of june 30 2021 we had approximately 719 million available to us for borrowing subject to certain conditions under our revolving credit facility if new debt is added to our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels the risks associated with debt we currently face would increase 

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of operating company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply which operating company’s amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may 20 2014 as amended the “ credit agreement ” calls “ restricted subsidiaries ”  to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock 

• pay certain dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments 

• pay distributions from restricted subsidiaries 

• issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries 

• guarantee certain indebtedness 

• make certain investments 

• sell or exchange certain assets 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• create certain liens and 

• consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of crossdefault provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

despite the limitations in our debt agreements we retain the ability to take certain actions that may interfere with our ability to timely pay our substantial indebtedness 

the covenants in the credit agreement and in the several indentures governing our senior notes collectively the indentures contain various exceptions to the limitations they otherwise impose on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to take the various actions described in the prior risk factor for example if the senior notes have investmentgrade ratings and we are not in default under these agreements certain of these covenants will not apply including the covenants restricting certain dividends and other payments the covenants concerning the incurrence of indebtedness and the covenants limiting guarantees of indebtedness by our restricted subsidiaries in addition the covenants restricting dividends and other distributions by us purchases or redemption of certain equity securities and prepayment redemption or repurchase of any subordinated indebtedness are subject to various exceptions 

we are currently using and may in the future use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness or changes in currency exchange rates and any such instrument may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we have executed and may enter into additional or new interestrate swap agreements currency swap agreements or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to adverse changes in variable interest rates and currency exchange rates such instruments may result in economic losses if for example prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixedrate commitment any such swap will expose us to creditrelated risks that if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to our series a preferred stock 

the issuance of shares of our series a preferred stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock dilutes the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

on may 16 2019 we filed with the delaware secretary of state a certificate of designation of preferences rights and limitations as amended the “certificate of designation” with respect to 1000000 shares of our series a preferred stock and on may 17 2019 we completed the sale of 650000 shares of our series a preferred stock to affiliates the “preferred stock investors” of leonard green  partners lp as of august 23 2021 384777 of these shares remained outstanding representing approximately 44 of our outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis holders of series a preferred stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 50 per annum subject to adjustment and payable quarterly in cash or inkind through an increase in the stated value of each share of series a preferred stock holders of series a preferred stock also receive on an asconverted basis whatever holders of common stock receive as a result of any declaration of a dividend on the common stock 

under various circumstances defined in the certificate of designation shares of our series a preferred stock can be converted into or redeemed for shares of our common stock the number of shares of common stock into which series a preferred stock may convert or be redeemed is based in part on the stated value of a share of series a preferred stock so any increase in the stated value may lead to an increase in the number of deemed shares of common stock held by the preferred stock investors on an “asconverted” basis 

as holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to vote on an asconverted basis together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock the issuance of the series a preferred stock to the preferred stock investors and any subsequent increase in the stated value of those shares by a paymentinkind of the dividends payable thereon effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock 

any conversion or redemption of the series a preferred stock into or for shares of our common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock and any sale in the public market of shares of our common stock issued upon such conversion or redemption could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock we granted the preferred stock investors customary registration rights in respect of their shares of series a preferred stock and any share of our common stock issued upon any conversion or redemption thereof these registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading sales by the preferred stock investors of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock as described in note 8 earnings per share to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report the “consolidated financial statements”  on november 23 2020 the preferred stock investors converted 265233 shares approximately 41 of their holdings and 2 million of unpaid accrued dividends into shares of our common stock the holders received 2033 shares of common stock for each converted preferred share resulting in the issuance of 5392280 shares of our common stock 

the preferred stock investors may exercise influence over us including through their ability to designate and the ability of the holders of series a preferred stock to elect a member of our board of directors 

as of august 23 2021 the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock represented approximately 44 of our outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis in addition the terms of the series a preferred stock grant the preferred stock investors consent rights with respect to certain actions by us including 

• amending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the series a preferred stock 

• issuing securities that are senior to or equal in priority with the series a preferred stock and 

• incurring indebtedness to the extent such incurrence would cause our total leverage ratio for any applicable test period to exceed 600100 determined on a proforma basis as such terms are defined in our credit agreement 

as a result the preferred stock investors have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization the sponsors of the preferred stock investors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business and they may have interests that diverge from or even conflict with those of our other shareholders they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

in addition the terms of that certain stockholders’ agreement we entered into with the preferred stock investors the “stockholders’ agreement” and of the certificate of designation grant the preferred stock investors certain rights to designate a director to serve on our board of directors which director is elected by a separate class vote of the holders of shares of the series a preferred stock for so long as the preferred stock investors beneficially own shares of series a preferred stock or shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock that have an aggregate value of 250 million the preferred stock investors have the right to designate one director for election to our board of directors 

the director designated by the preferred stock investors is entitled to serve on committees of our board of directors subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law the interests of the director designated by the preferred stock investors may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors 

our series a preferred stock has rights preferences and privileges that are not held by and are preferential to the rights of holders of our common stock which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and may result in the interests of the preferred stock investors differing from holders of our common stock 

the holders of series a preferred stock have the right under the certificate of designation to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock an amount equal to the greater of a the stated value of their preferred shares plus all accrued and unpaid dividends or b the amount that such holders would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock had been converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to such liquidation dissolution or winding up 

in addition regular dividends on the series a preferred stock accrue and are cumulative at the rate of 5 per annum subject to adjustment and payable quarterly in arrears the dividend on each share of series a preferred stock is to be paid in cash or inkind through an increase in the stated value of such share 

we are also required to redeem all shares of series a preferred stock upon certain change of control events at a value per share equal to the greater of a the sum of 1 the product of a the applicable mandatory redemption multiplier as defined in the certificate of designation multiplied by b the stated value of each such share plus 2 all accrued but unpaid dividends on such share and b the consideration holders would have received if they had converted their shares of series a preferred stock into shares of common stock immediately prior to the change of control event 

these dividend and share redemption obligations could adversely affect our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities acquisitions and other general corporate purposes our obligations to the holders of series a preferred stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition the preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the preferred stock investors and holders of shares of our common stock 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price has historically been and may continue to be volatile and a holder of shares of our common stock may not be able to resell such shares at or above the price such stockholder paid or at all and could lose all or part of such investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile for the three years ended june 30 2021 our common stock price as quoted on the nyse ranged from 2984 to 12527 the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected by any one or more of several factors such as those listed above in “ risks relating to our business and industry in which we operate ” and the following 

• results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts or investors 

• results of operations that vary from those of our competitors 

• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts or investors 

• declines in the market prices of stocks generally or those of pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts new products acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures other strategic relationships or capital commitments 

• changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets 

• changes in business or regulatory conditions or regulatory actions taken with respect to our business or the business of any of our competitors or customers 

• future sales of our common stock or other of our securities 

• investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives 

• any decision by securities analysts to not publish research or reports about our business or to downgrade our stock or our sector 

• the public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties including our filings with or information furnished to the sec 

• announcements relating to or developments in litigation 

• guidance if any that we provide to the public any change in this guidance or any failure to meet this guidance 

• the availability of an active trading market for our common stock 

• public response to changes in the covid19 pandemic and public perceptions as to the need for manufacture of certain covid19related products and our role in the successful manufacture of such products 

• changes in the accounting principles we use to record our results or our application of these principles to our business and 

• other events or factors including those resulting from natural disasters hostilities acts of terrorism geopolitical activity public health crises including pandemics or responses to these events 

broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on the individual actions of our stockholders 

following periods of market volatility stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses if we become involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future receiving a return on an investment in our common stock may require a sale for a net price greater than what was paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future any future decision to pay a dividend in respect of our common stock and the amount and timing of any such dividend will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend such factors as they may deem relevant including general economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future alternative deployments of our cash our future capital requirements and contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our holders of shares of our common stock or by our subsidiaries to us in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result a holder of a share of our common stock may not receive any return on such investment unless it is sold for a price greater than that which was paid for it taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale 

future sales or the perception of future sales of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate in addition holders of our series a preferred stock may sell shares of our common stock resulting from the conversion or redemption of their preferred shares and holders of restricted stock units or options may sell shares of common stock resulting from the vesting of their restricted stock units or the vesting and exercise of their options 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of our common stock sell their shares or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our equity securities that we wish to issue in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued or issuable in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the nyse or to restrictions set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness the certificate of designation and the stockholders’ agreement any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments acquisitions or otherwise may result in dilution to the holders of shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

• advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings though our board of directors has implemented shareholder proxy access 

• certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings 

• any amendment of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation only by the affirmative vote of at least 6623 of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

provisions such as those just described to the extent that they remain in effect could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares

we currently operate in four operating segments which also constitute our four reporting segments biologics softgel and oral technologies  oral and specialty delivery and clinical supply services as further described in business —our reporting segments contained elsewhere in this annual report  

the covid19 pandemic 

our response to covid19 

since the start of the covid19 pandemic we have taken and continue to take steps to protect our employees ensure the integrity and quality of our products and services and to maintain business continuity for our customers and their patients who depend on us to manufacture and supply critical products to the market t o address the multiple dimensions of the pandemic senior multidisciplinary teams reporting directly to our chief executive officer have been continuously monitoring the global situation executing mitigation activities whenever and wherever required and implementing a phased and structured return to our facilities as circumstances have permitted for those employees who have been working remotely 

among other things we implemented measures to avoid or reduce infection or contamination in line with guidelines issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention the world health organization and local authorities where we operate reemphasized good hygiene practices restricted nonemployee access to our sites reorganized our workflows where permitted to maximize physical distancing limited employee travel facilitated safer alternatives to travel to and from work and employed remoteworking strategies  we have reviewed and will continue to analyze our supply chain to identify any risk delay or concern that may have an impact on our ability to deliver our services and products to date we have not identified any significant risk delay or concern that would have a substantial effect on such delivery we have adopted various procedures to minimize and manage any future disruption to our ongoing operations including the creation and activation of 

new and existing business continuity plans when needed our existing procedures which are consistent with cgmp and other regulatory standards are intended to assure the integrity of our supply against any contamination we have a detailed response plan to manage any impact of the virus on employee health site operations and product supply including immediate assessment of the health of employees reporting symptoms comprehensive risk assessment of any impact to quality additional cleaning protocols and alternative shift patterns to compensate should fewer employees be available 

impact of covid19 on our business and results of operations 

throughout fiscal 2021 we observed some increases in customer delays and cancellations occasional increases in absenteeism of production employees in our facilities in certain affected regions disruptions at times in certain clinical trials supported by our clinical supply services segment and a delay in inspections and product approvals by the fda and regulatory authorities globally a portion of our customers reported a reduction in demand particularly in our consumer health product lines and a larger percentage reported an increase in demand 

we have also seen increased demand and significant revenue increases and the potential for further revenue increases from covid19related products particularly in our biologics segment as part of our response to the covid19 pandemic we accelerated and enhanced certain of our capital improvement plans to expand capacity for manufacturing drug substance and drug product for proteinbased biologics and cell and gene therapies particularly at our drug product facilities in bloomington indiana anagni italy and our commercialscale viral vector manufacturing facility in maryland in order to meet customer demand for developing manufacturing and packaging covid19related products we hired approximately 2200 new employees at our facilities in indiana maryland and anagni italy and built and brought online new clean room suites manufacturing lines and other facilities expansions in those locations ahead of schedule we have also implemented various strategies to protect our financial condition and results of operations should we experience a reduction in demand for covid19 related products such as ensuring contractual takeorpay and minimum volume requirements for the manufacture of certain covid19 related products however the extent and duration of revenue associated with covid19related products is uncertain and dependent in important respects on factors outside our control 

the covid19vaccines we manufacture are still pending approval from the fda and other nonus regulatory authorities and may not receive approval the future duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic and the future demand for covid19 vaccines and therapies is unknown public opinion of certain covid19 vaccines and therapies and the product owners and manufacturers can change quickly and affect the demand for certain products and services although they should not affect any required minimum payment for a covid19 related product subject to a “takeorpay” provision in addition any concentration of revenue from certain covid19 vaccine products enhances our operational risk with respect to quality security regulatory inspections and business disruption resulting from any unforeseen event that affects any of the facilities and communities in which we manufacture covid19 vaccines we have implemented various mechanisms to protect our customers their material and product and our business continuity such as enhanced security measures at certain facilities and heightened cybersecurity controls 

see also “risk factors — risks related to our business and the industry in which we operate — our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic” and “risk factors — risks related to our business and the industry in which we operate — the continually evolving nature of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting public health response including the changing demand for various covid19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world may affect on sales of the covid19 products we manufacture” elsewhere in this annual report 

critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements regarding significant areas of judgment management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply development services and clinical supply services 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment for our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements due to the regulated nature of our business these contract terms are highly interdependent and therefore are considered to be a single combined performance obligation for our development services and clinical supply services revenue our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations if a contract contains a single performance obligation we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation if a contract contains multiple performance obligations we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the “relative standalone selling price” as defined under accounting standards codification “asc” 606 revenue from contracts with customers  generally we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration if observable standalone selling prices are not available we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement determining the measure of progress that consistently depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment 

licensing revenue 

we occasionally enter into arrangements with customers that include licensing of functional intellectual property including drug formulae or other intangible property “outlicensing” we do not have any material license arrangement that contains more than one performance obligation our outlicensing generally entitles us to nonrefundable upfront fees or royalties nonrefundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when the licensed property is made available for the customer’s use and benefit provided there is no unsatisfied performance obligation included in the arrangement royalty payments from such arrangements are recognized when subsequent sale or usage of an item subject to the royalty occurs and the performance obligation to which royalty relates is satisfied 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with asc 350  intangibles  goodwill and other  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed the evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response or if no qualitative assessment is performed a quantitative assessment based upon discounted cash flows is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions in fiscal 2020 we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment but in fiscal 2019 and 2021 we began with the qualitative assessment accordingly no sensitivity analysis was performed for fiscal 2021 the evaluations performed in fiscal 2019 2020 and 2021 resulted in no impairment charge  

see notes 4 goodwill and 5 other intangibles net to the consolidated financial statements 

series a preferred stock dividend adjustment feature 

the terms of the series a preferred stock include a dividend adjustment feature to provide the holders with certain protections against a decline in the trading price of our common stock because this adjustment feature depends in part on the value of external metrics at future dates over which we have no control this feature is accounted for separately from the rest of the series a preferred stock as a derivative instrument which is measured at fair value as of the valuation date using a combination of i a monte carlo simulation and ii a binomial lattice model which incorporates the terms and conditions of the series a preferred stock and is based on changes in the market prices of shares of our common stock over successive periods key assumptions used in both models include the current market price of one share of the common stock and its historical and expected volatility riskneutral interest rates and the remaining term of the adjustment feature the calculation of the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is highly sensitive to changes in the unobservable inputs such as the expected volatility and our specific credit spread  we recognize the derivative as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance 

sheets at its fair value and revalue it as of the end of each quarterly reporting period changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

income taxes 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and the corresponding financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in fiscal 2018 we recorded a provision for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act the ”2017 tax act” but we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in post fiscal 2018 years 

the 2017 tax act imposed taxes on socalled “global intangible lowtaxed income” “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a us company in accordance with asc 740 we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred 

we assess the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering all available evidence both positive and negative in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluate four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

• carrybacks of existing nols if and to the extent permitted by tax law 

• future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 

• tax planning strategies and 

• future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 

we consider the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets as a result of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law 

unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution 

our accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the us and in each of the nonus jurisdictions in which we operate particularly european tax jurisdictions the determination of income subject to taxation in each taxpaying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate in addition the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction for those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates we apply transferpricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions the estimates and assumptions used in these allocations can result in uncertainty in the measured tax benefit 

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our annual financial reporting periods end on june 30 our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in europe and the us the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the 

timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms in fiscal 2019 we completed acquisitions of an earlyphase development site in the uk and a gene therapy business in the us which have been integrated into our oral and specialty delivery and biologics segments respectively in fiscal 2020 we completed the acquisition of additional gene and cell therapy assets in the us and belgium which have been integrated into our biologics segment we also completed the acquisition of the anagni facility in italy which has been integrated into our oral and specialty delivery and biologics segments in fiscal 2021 we expanded the capacity and capabilities of our biologics segment through five acquisitions first in september 2020 we purchased a facility in bloomington indiana that was still undergoing qualification at the time of acquisition and is intended to support development and earlyphase clinical fill and finish activities we also completed four additional acquisitions in gosselies belgium i the november 2020 purchase of skeletal cell therapy support sa “skeletal” including its cell therapy manufacturing facility ii the april 2021 purchase of hepatic cell therapy support sa “hepatic” which also included a cell therapy manufacturing facility colocated with skeletal in a building owned by société d’infrastructures de services et d’énergies sa “sise” iii the june 2021 purchase of sise the owner of the building housing skeletal and hepatics facilities and iv the february 2021 purchase of delphi in february 2021 we also acquired a dry powder inhaler and spray dry manufacturing business from acorda therapeutics inc “acorda” which is included in our oral and specialty delivery segment 

foreign exchange rates 

our operating network is global and as a result we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the currency in which we report our financial results and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2021 approximately 38 of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the us significant foreign currencies for our operations include the british pound european euro brazilian real argentine peso japanese yen and the canadian dollar 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry which has been estimated to generate more than 1 trillion in annual revenue including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors innovative pharmaceuticals and biologics in particular continue to play a critical role in the global market while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving consumer health product growth payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in earlystage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions and new treatment modalities additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with the global covid19 pandemic and health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of the global population will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals biologics and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved and new modality treatments will continue to escalate the need for advanced formulation and manufacturing product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

nongaap metrics 

as described in this section management uses various financial metrics including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in us gaap to measure and assess the performance of our business to make critical business decisions and to assess our compliance with certain financial obligations we therefore believe that presentation of certain of these nongaap metrics in this annual report will aid investors in understanding our business 

ebitda from operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense expense benefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted for the income attributable to noncontrolling interests  “ ebitda from operations ”  ebitda from operations is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of noncash depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the consolidated financial statements and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the most directly comparable measure to ebitda from operations defined under us gaap is net earnings included in this management’s discussion and analysis is a reconciliation of net earnings to ebitda from operations 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other income expense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization  “ segment ebitda ”  

adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement and in the indentures the ability of operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “ consolidated ebitda ” in the credit agreement and “ebitda” in the indentures adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement and indentures particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is based on the definitions in the credit agreement is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

in addition we use adjusted ebitda as a performance metric that guides management in its operation of and planning for the future of the business and drives certain management compensation programs management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a useful measure of our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core business including interest expense and noncash charges like depreciation and amortization 

the measure under us gaap most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net earnings in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are deducted when calculating ebitda from operations and net earnings consistent with the requirements of the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things 

• does not include noncash stockbased employee compensation expense and certain other noncash charges 

• does not include cash and noncash restructuring severance and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance operations 

• adds back any noncontrolling interest expense which represents minority investors’ ownership of nonwholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and is therefore not available and 

• includes estimated cost savings that have not yet been fully reflected in our results 

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share 

we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share which we sometimes refer to as “ adjusted eps ” as performance metrics adjusted net income is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations we believe that providing information concerning adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use these measures for business planning and executive compensation purposes we define adjusted net income as net earnings adjusted for 1 earnings or loss from discontinued operations net of tax 2 amortization attributable to purchase accounting and 3 income or loss from noncontrolling interest in majorityowned operations we also make adjustments for other cash and noncash items as shown above in “—adjusted ebitda” partially offset by our estimate of the tax effects as a result of such cash and noncash items our definition of adjusted net income may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies adjusted net income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap

gross margin

the yearoveryear increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also due to a 32 million increase in information technology spend associated with headcount increases additional cyber security initiatives insurance premium increases certain market research initiatives and covid19related spend for personal protective equipment and test kits for our employees 

other operating expense 

other operating expense for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 was 19 million and 11 million respectively the yearoveryear increase was attributable to an increase in impairment charges and an increase in restructuring costs primarily associated with our plan to reduce costs and optimize our infrastructure in europe by closing our clinical supply services facility in bolton uk 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 110 million in fiscal 2021 decreased by 16 million or 13 compared to fiscal 2020 driven by savings from repayment of our formerly outstanding dollardenominated term loans eurodenominated term loans eurodenominated 475 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” and us dollardenominated 4875 senior notes due 2026 the “2026 notes” partially offset by interest expenses on the 2028 notes the new tranche of dollardenominated term loans and the 2029 notes the savings also includes 6 million of additional capitalized interest costs for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year due to increased capital expenditures

biologics segment 

net revenue in our biologics segment increased by 876 million or 86 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase was driven across all segment offerings by robust endmarket demand for our global drug product drug substance and cell and gene therapy offerings primarily related to demand for covid19related programs

softgel and oral technologies segment 

net revenue in our softgel and oral technologies segment decreased by 77 million or 7 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the decrease primarily relates to reduced endmarket demand for prescription products within north america and europe as well as lower demand in consumer health products particularly in cough cold and overthecounter pain relief products attributable to the effects of the covid19 pandemic the net revenue decrease was partially offset by strong development revenue growth 

softgel and oral technologies segment ebitda decreased by 26 million or 10 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the decrease similar to that of net revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in demand in both the prescription and consumer health portfolio of products offset in part by the margin generated from strong development revenue growth

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and use of cash 

our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations and the net proceeds of capital market activities the principal uses of cash are to fund operating and capital expenditures business or asset acquisitions interest payments on debt the payment of deferred purchase consideration from the catalent indiana acquisition the payment of the quarterly dividend on the series a preferred stock and any mandatory or discretionary principal payment on our debt at the current stated value of the series a preferred stock outstanding as of june 30 2021 the aggregate amount of each regular quarterly dividend if paid in cash is 5 million as of june 30 2021 and following the february 2021 execution of amendment no 5 the “fifth amendment” to the credit agreement we had available a 725 million revolving credit facility that matures in may 2024 the capacity of which is reduced by the amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior secured credit facilities and those shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline borrowings at june 30 2021 we had 6 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility

interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities in february 2021 we replaced one interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na with another and each acts or acted as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variableinterest obligation associated with our us dollardenominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on future interest expense the applicable rate for the us dollardenominated term loan under the credit agreement was libor subject to a floor of 050 plus 200 as of june 30 2021 however as a result of the interestrate swap agreement the floating portion of the applicable rate on 500 million of the term loan was effectively fixed at 09985 as of february 2021 

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate on our investments in our foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2021 we had 984 million of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge on a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 9 derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

from time to time we may use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

we have historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variablerate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense 

in february 2021 we replaced one interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na with another and each acts or acted as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variableinterest obligation associated with our term loans under our senior secured credit facilities so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on future interest expense the applicable rate for the term loan under our credit agreement was libor subject to a floor of 050 plus 200 as of june 30 2021 however as a result of the interestrate swap agreement the floating portion of the applicable rate on 500 million of the term loan was effectively fixed at 09985 as of february 2021 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchangerate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products globally our foreigncurrency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreignexchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso and brazilian real our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars our functional currency the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency except in argentina a hyperinflationary economy where our results are measured in us dollars adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive income utilizing periodend exchange rates foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in other income expense net such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

we are a holding company that indirectly owns catalent pharma solutions inc “operating company” which owns directly or indirectly all of our operating subsidiaries 

our competitive strengths 

leading provider of advanced delivery technologies and development and manufacturing solutions 

we are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development and manufacturing solutions for drugs protein cell and gene therapy biologics and consumer health products in the last decade we have earned revenue with respect to nearly half of the drugs based on new molecular entities approved by the fda and over the past three years with respect to more than 80 of the top 200 largestselling compounds globally with more than 2400 scientists and technicians worldwide and nearly 1300 patents and patent applications our expertise is in providing differentiated technologies and solutions that help our customers bring more products and better treatments to market faster for example in the highvalue area of new chemical entities  “ nces ”  approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us 

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope our large customer base the extensive range of products we produce our broad service offerings and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of a product’s lifecycle in fiscal 2020 we produced nearly 7000 distinct items across multiple categories our fiscal 2020 regulatorybased classification of revenues demonstrates this branded drugs 38 generic prescription drugs 5 protein cell and gene therapy biologics 37 overthecounter drugs 11 and consumer health veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics 9 combined in fiscal 2020 our top 20 products represented approximately 18 of our total net revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of revenue and with no individual product greater than 3 we serve more than 1000 customers in approximately 85 countries with 41 of our fiscal 2020 net revenue coming from outside the united states this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payerdriven pricing pressures experienced by our drug and biologic customers 

longstanding extensive relationships with a diverse customer base 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2020 we did business with 86 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 24 of the top 25 generics marketers 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 22 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally as well as with more than 1000 other customers including emerging and specialty companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs 

we believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers 

deep broad and growing advanced technology foundation 

our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants our leading softgel platforms including liquigels optishell and vegicaps capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family and our optipact and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory ophthalmic and injectable routes including the blowfillseal unit dose technology and prefilled syringes we also provide advanced biologics formulation options including gpex and gpex boost cell lines smartag adc technology and aav vectors for cell and gene therapies we have a leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and nebulized and intranasal forms we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last five years as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications including the fiscal 2016 launch of our optiform solution suite a dose formagnostic bioavailability enhancement program for earlystage molecules the launch of development clinical and commercialscale spray drying services and the recent acquisitions of catalent indiana catalent maryland and masthercell which expanded our biologics business and extended us into cell and gene therapy our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies our scientists and engineers and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network our global product development team drives a focused application of resources to our highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development  as of june 30 2020 we had approximately 1200 product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final formulations and dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years see “— contractual arrangements ” for more detail approximately twothirds of our fiscal 2020 advanced delivery technology platform net revenues comprised of our softgel and oral technologies biologics and oral and specialty delivery reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage 

significant recent growth investments 

we have made over time and expect to continue to make significant investments to strengthen our manufacturing network which is capable of serving customers and patients worldwide and today employ 71 million square feet of manufacturing laboratory and related space across four continents we have deployed approximately 11 billion in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures not including more than 30 billion spent in acquiring new facilities and businesses growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive for ongoing and continuous improvements in safety productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  “ cgmp ”  or other applicable requirements following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have more than 1900 employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance all of our facilities are registered where required with the fda or other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency the “ema” in some cases facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies in fiscal 2020 we were subject to 50 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed approximately 290 regulatory audits we also undergo more than 500 customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a favorable competitive differentiator 

strong and experienced management team 

our executive leadership team collectively has nearly 600 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of more than 27 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships 

our strategy 

we are pursuing the following key growth initiatives 

“ follow the molecule ” ® providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development and manufacturing solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for early preclinical development of small molecules protein cell and gene therapy biologics adcs formulation and analytical services development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for clinical trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and expert manufacturing solutions that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in appropriate dosage forms and to produce biologics drug substances needed for protein cell and gene therapy biologics the relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life including with additional customers through potential generic launches or overthecounter conversion for prescription products we are typically the sole or primary outsourced provider and as a result are frequently reflected in customers’ new drug applications our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of an innovator drug’s market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply customers offering generic or biosimilar equivalents 

an example of this can be found in a leading overthecounter antiallergy brand which today uses both our zydis orally dissolving tablets and our liquigels softgel technology we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription product in our zydis orally dissolving tablets for six years and we have continued to provide the zydis form since the switch to overthecounter status in the united states and other markets in the early 2000s subsequently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 28yearlong relationship across multiple formats and markets 

customer product pipeline — continuing to grow through new projects and product launches 

we intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized customer products with new development programs as of june 30 2020 our product development teams were working on approximately 1200 new customer programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our expanded capabilities and technologies through both internal investment and acquisitions although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical protein cell and gene therapy biologics and consumer health products we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in fiscal 2020 we introduced 163 new products for our customers 

catalent continues to be the global leader in providing analytical manufacturing and controlsbased product development services to the global pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health industries driven by thousands of projects annually in fiscal 2020 we recognized 10166 million of revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers included in our softgel and oral technologies biologics and oral and specialty delivery reporting segments up 56 from the prior year in addition substantially all of the revenue associated with the clinical supply services segment relates to our support of customer products in development 

capabilities  capacity — expanding in biologics and other attractive markets 

recognizing the strategic importance of biologics we began to build a differentiated biologics cellline and formulation development platform in 2002 since then we have invested over 30 billion in our biologics business including capital investments the fiscal 2020 acquisition of masthercell for an aggregate nominal purchase price of 3233 million the fiscal 2019 acquisitions of our gene therapy assets including catalent maryland for an aggregate nominal purchase price of 12 billion and the fiscal 2018 acquisition of catalent indiana for an aggregate nominal purchase price of 9500 million today we are a recognized leader in biologics including aav vectors for gene therapies development for cell therapies advanced cellline development formulation and fillfinish into prefilled syringes vials and cartridges specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substance and bioanalytical analysis we have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for nearly 700 cell lines many using our advanced gpex and gpex boost technologies and have actively collaborated on developing and scaling up more than 70 cell and gene therapies we have also invested in a secondgeneration adc technology smartag and we see continued progress in our customers’ smartag productdevelopment activities 

in addition to our expansion in biologics we have invested additional capital in several other existing facilities in order to expand in attractive markets including a significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in winchester kentucky the scalingup of commercial manufacturing capacity for metereddose inhalers and our commencement of a 340 million capital investment to commercialize our nextgeneration orally dissolving tablet odt technology zydis ultra we have also added key new capabilities in early development via our fiscal 2019 acquisition of juniper and our fiscal 2017 acquisition of pharmatek we expanded our capacity for oral and injectable products via our fiscal 2020 anagni acquisition and for north american consumer health softgels via our fiscal 2017 accucaps acquisition 

advanced delivery technologies — capitalize on our substantial platforms 

we have broad and diverse technology platforms that are supported by extensive knowhow and nearly 1300 patents and patent applications in approximately 139 families across advanced delivery technologies drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation knowhow databases of formulated products and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us 

in addition to resolving delivery challenges for our customers’ products for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proofofconcept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file 

product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for selfcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

operational leverage — deploy existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our lean manufacturing and lean six sigma programs a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability we intend to continue to apply this discipline to leverage further our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2009 we have expanded gross margin by over 400 basis points and adjusted ebitda margin by over 400 basis points note that “adjusted ebitda” is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  “ us gaap ”  and that further explanations of this measure and comparisons to the most directly comparable us gaap measures are set forth below at “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—nongaap metrics ” 

strategic acquisitions and licensing — build on our existing platform 

we operate in highly fragmented markets in both our commercial supply and development solutions businesses within the market for commercial supply the ten top players represent approximately 39 of the total market share by revenue within the market for development solutions the five top players represent approximately 10 of the total market share by revenue our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets to enter new markets and to generate operating leverage through acquisitions since fiscal 2013 we have executed 13 transactions investing approximately 31 billion and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

while we are rigorously focused on driving catalent’s organic growth we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolton strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments we have a dedicated corporate development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions 

our reporting segments 

in fiscal 2020 we engaged in a business reorganization of our operating segments to better align our internal business unit structure with our “follow the molecule” strategy and the increased focus on our biologicsrelated offerings under the revised structure we changed the components and names of three of our four operating segments with our fourth segment clinical supply services unchanged 

we currently operate in four operating segments which also constitute our four reporting segments softgel and oral technologies  biologics oral and specialty delivery and clinical supply services as further described below 

softgel and oral technologies

our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and consumer health companies along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices and companies in adjacent industries such as cosmetics we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2020 we did business with 86 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 24 of the top 25 generics marketers 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 22 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally as well as with more than 1000 other customers faced with access pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities while reducing their fixed cost base many midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies while facing the same pricing and market pressures have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills technologies and services required to bring their products to market consumer health companies require rapidly developed innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up with the fastpaced overthecounter medication vitamins and personal care markets these market segments are all important to our growth but require distinct solutions marketing and sales approaches and market strategy 

we follow a hybrid demandgeneration organization model with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering our sales organization currently consists of more than 160 fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings as part of our marketing efforts we participate in major trade shows relevant to our offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and universe of target customers and that our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us 

global accounts 

we manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential we recorded approximately 17 of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 from these global accounts each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to formulate develop analyze test and manufacture their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of these customers 

seasonality fluctuations in operation results 

our annual financial reporting periods end on june 30 our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental europe and the uk the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses and quality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice minimum volume commitments royalties manufacturing preparation services profitsharing and fixed fees we employ a range of capacity access approaches from standard to completely dedicated capacity models based on customer and product needs we generally secure pricing and other contract mechanisms in our supply agreements to allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements permit us to raise or renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials we use to make products our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions the terms of our manufacturing supply agreements range from three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our softgel and oral technologies biologics and oral and specialty delivery segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our clinical supply services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2020 our backlog was 22823 million compared to 13498 million as of june 30 2019 including 4247 million and 3663 million respectively related to our clinical supply services segment we expect to recognize as revenue approximately 72 of the value of the backlog in existence as of june 30 2020 by the completion of fiscal 2021 

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world as of june 30 2020 we had 53 facilities 4 geographical locations operate as multiple facilities because they support more than one reporting segment on four continents with 71 million square feet of manufacturing laboratory and related space in addition in may 2020 we agreed to acquire a clinical packaging facility in shiga japan from takedateva pharmaceuticals inc the acquisition closed in july 2020 our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

we operate our manufacturing facilities and development centers in accordance with cgmp or other applicable requirements all of these sites are registered where required with the fda or other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases our sites are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested 8604 million in our manufacturing and development facilities since fiscal 2018 for improvements and expansions including 4658 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 we believe that our sites and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2020 we achieved approximately 97 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including lean six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for our softgel and oral technologies segment packaging films for our clinical supply services segment and glass vials and syringes for injectable fillfinish in our biologics segment and resin for our blowfillseal business in our oral and specialty delivery segment the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics or geopolitical and other issues for example commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy  “ bse ”  have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers any future restriction that were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval periods 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see “ risk factors—risks relating to our business and industry— our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials ” 

competition 

we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including with other companies that offer conventional and advanced delivery technologies clinical trials support outsourced dose form biologics or cell and gene therapy manufacturing or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have access to more substantial resources which could be deployed to expand their range of offerings or capacity 

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed while we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings and a few competitors that compete across many of our offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable company 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements costs incurred in connection with the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses such research and development costs included in selling general and administrative expenses amounted to 26 million 33 million and 63 million for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively costs incurred in connection with research and development services we provide to customers and services performed in support of the commercial manufacturing process for customers are recorded within cost of sales such research and development costs included in cost of sales amounted to 612 million 512 million and 462 million for fiscal years ended 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us for which we have recorded appropriate reserves as needed we believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with the environment health and safety regulations applicable to our facilities 




 item 1a risk factors 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and industry 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic 

in january 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 pandemic to be a “public health emergency of international concern” covid19 has spread across the globe and is affecting worldwide economic activity any public health epidemic including the covid19 pandemic may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely including our customers and suppliers our business financial condition and results of operations may be affected by disruptions in our customers’ abilities to fund develop or bring to market products as anticipated delays in or disruptions to the conduct of clinical trials cancellations of contracts or confirmed orders from our customers decreased demand for categories of products in certain affected regions and inability difficulty or additional cost or delays in obtaining key raw materials components and other supplies from our existing supply chain among other factors caused by the covid19 pandemic in addition the covid19 pandemic may affect the operations of the fda and other drug regulatory authorities which could result in delays of inspections reviews and approvals of our customers’ products our operations could be disrupted if our employees become ill or are otherwise absent from work as a result of the covid19 pandemic governmental restrictions including travel restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders business closures new safety requirements or regulations or restrictions on the import or export of certain materials or other operational issues related to the covid19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we continue to monitor our operations and governmental recommendations and have made modifications for an indefinite period to our normal operations because of the covid19 pandemic including requiring most nonproduction related employees to work remotely additionally while the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the covid19 pandemic are difficult to assess or predict the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital which could negatively affect our short and longterm liquidity 

to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations however the extent to which covid19 may affect our future results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain including the duration of the pandemic new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions governments the pharmaceutical industry competitors suppliers customers patients and others may take to contain or address its direct and indirect effects the covid19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures may also have an adverse impact on healthcare systems global economic conditions or economic conditions in one or more regions where we or our customers operate which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

in addition the impact of the covid19 pandemic could exacerbate other risks we face including those described elsewhere in risk factors 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities in addition customer spending may be affected by among other things the covid19 pandemic or recessionary economic conditions caused in whole or in part by the pandemic 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon among other things available resources and their need to develop new products which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors including their competitors’ research development and production initiatives and the anticipated market uptake clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas in addition consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations including research and development departments and their budgets our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers for these reasons or because of the covid19 pandemic or its direct or indirect effects could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including competing with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing clinical trials support services or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally 

we face substantial competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed some competitors have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customers’ requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could exceed our anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers we have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the amount of available policy limits require larger selfinsured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 250 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability or other claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we and our customers are subject to various local state federal national and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs similar bodies of the eu and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world and in the future any change to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us among other rules affecting us we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cgmp and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits or licenses and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the fda the dea the dhhs exus agencies including the ema and various boards of pharmacy health departments or comparable agencies in various jurisdictions around the world as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our offerings are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal national and transnational regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals permits or registrations including those relating to products or facilities in addition any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant customers may also claim loss of profits due to lost or delayed 

sales although our contracts generally place substantial limits on such claims there can be no assurance that any such contractual limitation will be applicable sufficient or fully enforced in any given situation 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical or medical device must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal national and transnational regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions that regulate our offerings and products we or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new offerings or products for any number of reasons 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us or our customers with applicable law or regulation or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore loss of a permit license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions or costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design formulation development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the products we supply quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution or restrictions on our operations monetary fines or other civil or criminal sanctions in addition such an issue could subject us to costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses the cost of which could be significant 

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our softgel and oral technologies biologics and oral and specialty delivery segments due in part to strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses time and expense spent investigating the cause lost production time and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation 

our global operations are subject to economic political and regulatory risks including the risks of changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards that could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures in addition changes to our procedures or additional procedures implemented to comply with public health orders or best practice guidelines as a result of the covid19 

pandemic may increase our costs or reduce our productivity and thereby affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global and regional economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition including potential competition from manufacturers in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain our customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such mitigating measures may be unavailable costly or unsuccessful 

the exit of the uk from the european union particularly after the end of the current transitional period could have future adverse effects on our operations revenues and costs and therefore our profitability 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved the uk’s exit from the eu and the uk government withdrew in october 2019 there is no immediate change affecting our business in either the uk or the eu as a result of this action but the uk government is now engaged in both internal and external discussions with affected parties and considering legislation regarding the changes that will result from the decision to exit five of our facilities employing hundreds of workers are located in the uk and these facilities as well as others in our network source goods manufacture goods and provide services from or intended for the uk these facilities operate within an existing framework of trade and human capital integration with the eu and by extension the other parts of the world with which the eu has trade and immigration agreements furthermore some of our facilities located in other eu member states ship materials to and from or otherwise engage in various business interactions with the uk including our uk facilities due to future changes in the uk resulting from its exit including potentially increased trade barriers increased tariff rates or custom duties or in anticipation of such changes our suppliers customers or employees may change their interactions with us including changes in imports to or exports from the uk changes in the requested utilization of our facilities both within and without the uk and changes in our relationships with our ukbased workforce to the extent that our facilities operate as part of a crossborder supply and distribution chain their operations may also be negatively affected by a decrease in the crossborder mobility of goods and services we cannot anticipate the nature of these changes as they largely depend on factors outside our control but the changes may result in adverse changes in our future operations revenues and costs and therefore our future profitability 

if we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time customers may not buy our offerings or buy less of them and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies to the extent that such technologies are protected by patents their related offerings may become subject to competition as the patents expire without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings and technologies our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations 

the success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs including increasing demand for lower cost products 

• enhance innovate develop and manufacture new offerings in an economical and timely manner 

• differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings 

• achieve positive clinical outcomes for our customers’ new products 

• meet safety requirements and other regulatory requirements of governmental agencies 

• obtain valid and enforceable intellectual property rights and 

• avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 

even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks knowhow trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect many of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will provide uniqueness or meaningful competitive differentiation in our offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur which may force us to compete with third parties thereby negatively affecting our revenue and profitability we do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any patent currently protecting our business 

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of such proceedings may be unfavorable to us 

any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

we have applied in the united states and certain other countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered or issued and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks in the past third parties have occasionally opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the united states or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

license agreements with third parties control our rights to use certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies owned by third parties some of which are important to our business termination of these license agreements for any reason could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property causing an adverse change in our operations or the inability to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the united states for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents if the patents on which our customers rely were successfully challenged and as a result the affected products become subject to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings 

our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future 

while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and certain other countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claim that our offerings or processes infringe thirdparty intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of the claim’s merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters if any such claim results in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to 

• pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages in the united states 

• cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing offerings or processes 

• discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

• expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology 

• license technology from the third party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all and 

• lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others 

in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials in addition the covid19 pandemic may interfere with the operations of certain of our direct or indirect suppliers or with international trade for these supplies which may either raise our costs or reduce the productivity or slow the timing of our operations 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings this includes but is not limited to gelatin starch iota carrageenan petroleumbased products packaging films glass vials and syringes and resin also our customers frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product and may supply other raw materials as well it is possible that any of our or our customers’ supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements import or export restrictions natural disasters international supply disruptions whether caused by pandemics or otherwise geopolitical issues operational or quality issues at the suppliers’ facilities and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin is a critical component in most of the products produced in our softgel and oral technologies segment gelatin is available from only a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from bse or otherwise any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for or public sentiment towards our customers’ products in the united states or internationally or other changes in applicable policies regarding the healthcare industry including possible changes to the affordable care act the “ aca ”  in the united states could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by affecting demand for our offerings 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings that they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for these offerings in particular there is significant uncertainty about the likelihood of changes to the aca and healthcare laws in general in the united states including future legislation that may affect or put a cap on future pricing of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products while we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the aca any substantial revision of this or other healthcare legislation could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers’ products which in turn could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or business changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices or in public or government sentiment for the industry as a whole could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

as a global enterprise fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar our reporting currency against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations  

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including our eurodenominated 2375 senior notes due 2028 are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar which is the currency that we use to report our financial results as a result changes in the exchange rates of these or any other applicable currency to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates affecting the various currencies in which we do business including as a result of the uk’s exit from the eu such volatility and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies 

tax legislative or regulatory initiatives new interpretations or developments concerning existing tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational enterprise with operations in the united states and more than a dozen other countries across north and south america europe and the asiapacific region and we do business with suppliers and customers in many additional countries as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of many jurisdictions outside of the us from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and existing legislation such as the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” may be subject to additional regulatory changes or new interpretations  there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 

in addition us federal state local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by taxing authorities could result in adverse impacts to tax years open under statute or to our operating structures currently in place we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations to determine the reasonableness of our provision for taxes it is possible that the outcomes from these examinations or changes in laws rules regulations or interpretations by taxing authorities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we generated net operating losses “nols” in the past that have been and continue to be used to reduce taxable income utilization of our nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code ”  and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the internal revenue code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an “ ownership change ” 

generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange nols to reduce its postchange income may be limited in addition we acquired companies that generated preacquisition nols for tax purposes that will also be subject to limitation under section 382 and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our prechange nol carryforwards to reduce us federal state local and foreign taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

changes to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net deferred tax assets 

we have deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets and certain foreign net deferred tax assets it is possible we may experience a decline in us taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some additional portion or all our deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new and enhanced offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel or a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on more than 160 senior employees to lead and direct our business our senior leadership team  “ slt ”  is comprised of our subsidiaries’ executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market the members of the slt hold positions such as facility general manager vice presidentgeneral manager of business unit commercial development vice president of quality and regulatory activities and vice presidentfinance 

with respect to our technical talent we employ more than 2400 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery biologics and gene and cell therapy formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like those in which our morrisville north carolina brussels belgium woodstock illinois madison wisconsin baltimore maryland emeryville california bloomington indiana nottingham uk and schorndorf germany facilities are located global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

we use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations compile and analyze financial and operational data and communicate among our employees customers and counterparties and the risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations we are continuously working to install new and upgrade existing systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber security risks to enhance the protections available to us but such protections may be inadequate to address malicious attacks or inadvertent compromises of data security 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain process analyze and manage data to 

• facilitate the manufacture and distribution of thousands of inventory items in to and from our facilities 

• receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

• manage the accurate billing and collections for more than one thousand customers 

• create compile and retain testing and other product manufacturing or facilityrelated data necessary for meeting our and our customers’ regulatory obligations 

• manage the accurate accounting and payment for thousands of vendors and our employees 

• schedule and operate our global network of development manufacturing and packaging facilities 

• document various aspects of our activities including the agreements we make with suppliers and customers 

• compile financial and other operational data into reports necessary to manage our business and comply with various regulatory or contractual obligations including obligations under our bank loans and other indebtedness the federal securities laws the internal revenue code and other applicable state local and exus tax laws and 

• communicate among our more than 13900 employees spread across dozens of facilities over four continents 

we deploy defenses against cyberattack and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques hardware and software typical of companies of our size and scope despite our security measures however our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by increasingly sophisticated intruders or others who try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems they are also susceptible to breach due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged or fail for any extended period 

we engage from time to time in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or in divestments of nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom the failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations 

our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities or divest assets or an ongoing business we may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration we or the purchaser of a divested asset or business may not be able to complete a desired transaction for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing 

any acquisition that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies which may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing desired divestitures as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or continue to absorb the costs of lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestiture whether we are able to complete it or not may involve a number of risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with maintaining the business of the targeted divestiture during the disposition process and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring remaining portions of the operations of the business to other facilities 

cell and gene therapies are relatively new and stilldeveloping modes of treatment dependent on cuttingedge technologies and our customers’ cell or gene therapies may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events negative public opinion continuing research or increased regulatory scrutiny of cell or gene therapies and their financial cost may damage public perception of the safety utility or efficacy of these therapies and harm our customers’ ability to conduct their business or obtain regulatory approvals for their cell or gene therapy products and thereby have an indirect adverse effect on our cell or gene therapy offerings 

cell and gene therapy remain relatively new means for treating disease and other medical conditions with only a few cell and gene therapies approved to date in the us the eu or elsewhere public perception may be influenced by claims that cell or gene therapies are unsafe and cell or gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community in addition ethical social legal and costbenefit concerns about cell or gene therapy genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or limitations or even outright prohibitions on certain cell or gene therapies or related products various regulatory and legislative bodies have expressed an interest in or have taken steps towards further regulation of various biotechnologies including cell and gene therapies more restrictive regulations or claims that certain cell or gene therapies are unsafe or pose a hazard could reduce our customers’ use of our services we can provide no assurance whether legislative changes will be enacted regulations policies or guidance changed or interpretations of existing strictures by agencies or courts changed or what the impact of such changes if any may be 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa and the us occupational safety  health administration and equivalent local state national and transnational regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material included in our offerings and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded reserves we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us and such activities may result in unanticipated costs or management distraction 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we employ more than 13900 individuals worldwide including approximately 7600 employees in north america 4900 in europe 900 in south america and 500 in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils or labor organizations are active at all of our european facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environments and laws our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities collective bargaining or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employmentrelated costs or may result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make to increase the funding level will reduce the cash available for our business such as the payment of our interest expense 

certain of our current and former employees in the us the uk germany france japan belgium and switzerland are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2020 the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was 629 million primarily related to our pension plans in the uk and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of 386 million as of june 30 2020 related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns applicable actuarial assumptions prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness 

  risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business expose us to interestrate risk to the extent of our variablerate debt or prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness these risks may be increased in a recessionary environment particularly as sources of capital may become less available or more expensive 

as of june 30 2020 we had 30573 million us dollar equivalent of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 9381 million of secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 18756 million of senior unsecured 

indebtedness including 5000 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2027 the “usd 2027 notes” 4500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 the “usd 2026 notes” €8250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2028 the “euro 2028 notes” and together with the usd 2027 notes and usd 2026 notes the “senior notes” 100 million representing the gross value of the remaining deferred purchase consideration related to the acquisition of catalent indiana and 1422 million of finance lease and other obligations in addition we had 5433 million of unutilized capacity and 67 million of outstanding letters of credit under our 5500 million secured revolving credit facility which is part of our senior secured credit facilities the “revolving credit facility” 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest 

• exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of our euro notes 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions could result in one or more events of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness or through crossdefaults in agreements governing other indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or capital investments or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

our total interest expense net was 1261 million 1109 million and 1114 million for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloatingrate debt including as a result of our april 2020 interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na and assuming that our revolving credit facility is undrawn and libor is above any applicable minimum floor each change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in a change of approximately 07 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 

  

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries are still capable of incurring significant additional debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition as of june 30 2020 we had approximately 5433 million available to us for borrowing subject to certain conditions under our revolving credit facility if new debt is added to our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels the risks associated with debt we currently face would increase 

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of operating company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply which operating company’s amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may 20 2014 as amended the “ credit agreement ” calls “ restricted subsidiaries ”  to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock 

• pay certain dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments 

• pay distributions from restricted subsidiaries 

• issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries 

• guarantee certain indebtedness 

• make certain investments 

• sell or exchange certain assets 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• create certain liens and 

• consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of crossdefault provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

despite the limitations in our debt agreements we retain the ability to take certain actions that may interfere with our ability to timely pay our substantial indebtedness 

the covenants in the credit agreement and in the several indentures governing our senior notes collectively the indentures contain various exceptions to the limitations they otherwise impose on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to take the various actions described in the prior risk factor for example if the notes have investmentgrade ratings and we are not in default under these agreements certain of these covenants will not apply including the covenants restricting certain dividends and other payments the covenants concerning the incurrence of indebtedness and the covenants limiting guarantees of indebtedness by our restricted subsidiaries in addition the covenants restricting dividends and other distributions by us purchases or redemption of certain equity securities and prepayment redemption or repurchase of any subordinated indebtedness are subject to various exceptions 

we are currently using and may in the future use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness or changes in currency exchange rates and any such instrument may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into interestrate swap agreements currency swap agreements or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to adverse changes in variable interest rates and currency exchange rates such instruments may result in economic losses if for example prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixedrate commitment any such swap will expose us to creditrelated risks that if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to our series a preferred stock 

the issuance of shares of our series a preferred stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock dilutes the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

on may 16 2019 we filed with the delaware secretary of state a certificate of designation of preferences rights and limitations as amended the “certificate of designation” with respect to 1000000 shares of our preferred stock par value 001 per share designating such shares as our series a convertible preferred stock the “series a preferred stock” and on may 17 2019 we completed the sale of 650000 shares of our series a preferred stock to affiliates the “preferred stock investors” of leonard green  partners lp pursuant to an equity commitment and investment agreement dated as of april 14 2019 between us and certain of the preferred stock investors as of august 25 2020 these shares represented approximately 81 of our outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis holders of series a preferred stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 50 per annum subject to adjustment and payable quarterly in arrears see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report the consolidated financial statements the dividends are to be paid in cash or inkind through an increase in the stated value of each share of series a preferred stock such holders are also entitled to receive on an asconverted basis whatever holders of each share of common stock may be entitled to receive as a result of any declaration of a dividend on the common stock 

under various circumstances defined in the certificate of designation a holders of shares of our series a preferred stock may be entitled to convert such shares to shares of our common stock b we may require all holders of such shares to convert such shares to shares of our common stock or c we may redeem all such shares for at our election cash or shares of our common stock the number of shares of common stock to which the shares of our series a preferred stock may convert or be redeemed is based in part on the stated value of a share of series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the certificate of designation so any increase in the stated value may lead to an increase in the number of deemed shares of common stock held by the preferred stock investors on an “asconverted” basis 

as holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to vote on an asconverted basis together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock the issuance of the series a preferred stock to the preferred stock investors and any subsequent increase in the stated value of those shares by a paymentinkind of the dividends payable thereon effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock 

any conversion of shares of the series a preferred stock to shares of our common stock or redemption of shares of series a preferred stock for shares of our common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock and any sale in the public market of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion or redemption of the series a preferred stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we granted the preferred stock investors customary registration rights in respect of their shares of series a preferred stock and any share of our common stock issued upon any conversion or redemption of the series a preferred stock these registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading sales by the preferred stock investors of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

the preferred stock investors may exercise influence over us including through their ability to designate and the ability of the holders of series a preferred stock to elect a member of our board of directors 

as of august 25 2020 the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock represented approximately 81 of our outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis in addition the terms of the series a preferred stock grant the preferred stock investors consent rights with respect to certain actions by us including 

• amending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the series a preferred stock 

• issuing securities that are senior to or equal in priority with the series a preferred stock and 

• incurrence of indebtedness to the extent such incurrence would cause our total leverage ratio for any applicable test period to exceed 600100 determined on a proforma basis as such terms are defined in our credit agreement 

as a result the preferred stock investors have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization the sponsors of the preferred stock investors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business and they may have interests that diverge from or even conflict with those of our other shareholders they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

in addition the terms of that certain stockholders’ agreement we entered into with the preferred stock investors the “stockholders’ agreement” and of the certificate of designation grant the preferred stock investors certain rights to designate a director to serve on our board of directors which director is elected by a separate class vote of the holders of shares of the series a preferred stock for so long as the preferred stock investors beneficially own shares of series a preferred stock or shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock that have an aggregate value of 2500 million the preferred stock investors have the right to designate one director for election to our board of directors in addition for so long as the preferred stock investors beneficially own shares of series a preferred stock or shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock that have an aggregate value of 5000 million the preferred stock investors have the right to designate one observer to our board of directors 

the director designated by the preferred stock investors is entitled to serve on committees of our board of directors subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law the interests of the director designated by the preferred stock investors may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors 

our series a preferred stock has rights preferences and privileges that are not held by and are preferential to the rights of holders of our common stock which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and may result in the interests of the preferred stock investors differing from holders of our common stock 

as holders of series a preferred stock the preferred stock investors have the right under the certificate of designation to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock an amount equal to the greater of a the stated value of their preferred shares plus all accrued and unpaid dividends or b the amount that such holders would have been 

entitled to receive upon our liquidation dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock had been converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to such liquidation dissolution or winding up 

in addition regular dividends on the series a preferred stock accrue and are cumulative at the rate of 50 per annum subject to adjustment and payable quarterly in arrears the dividend on each share of series a preferred stock is to be paid in cash or inkind through an increase in the stated value of such share 

we are also required to redeem all shares of series a preferred stock upon certain change of control events at a value per share equal to the greater of a the sum of 1 the product of a the applicable mandatory redemption multiplier as defined in the certificate of designation multiplied by b the stated value of each such share plus 2 all accrued but unpaid dividends on such share and b the consideration holders would have received if they had converted their shares of series a preferred stock into shares of common stock immediately prior to the change of control event 

these dividend and share redemption obligations could adversely affect our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities acquisitions and other general corporate purposes our obligations to the holders of series a preferred stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition the preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the preferred stock investors and holders of shares of our common stock 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may change significantly and a holder of shares of our common stock may not be able to resell such shares at or above the price such stockholder paid or at all and could lose all or part of such investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile for the three years ended june 30 2020 our common stock price as quoted on the nyse ranged from 1892 to 8052 the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of factors such as those listed above in “ risks relating to our business and industry ” and the following 

• results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts or investors 

• results of operations that vary from those of our competitors 

• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts or investors 

• declines in the market prices of stocks generally or those of pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts new products acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures other strategic relationships or capital commitments 

• changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets 

• changes in business or regulatory conditions or regulatory actions taken with respect to our business or the business of any of our competitors or customers 

• future sales of our common stock or other securities 

• investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives 

• the public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties including our filings with or information furnished to the sec 

• announcements relating to or developments in litigation 

• guidance if any that we provide to the public any change in this guidance or any failure to meet this guidance 

• the availability of an active trading market for our common stock 

• changes in the accounting principles we use to record our results or our application of these principles to our business and 

• other events or factors including those resulting from natural disasters hostilities acts of terrorism geopolitical activity public health crises including pandemics or responses to these events 

broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on the individual actions of our stockholders 

following periods of market volatility stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses if we become involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future a stockholder may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless it is sold for a net price greater than was paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future our board of directors has also authorized a stock buyback program that we may use from time to time to purchase shares of our common stock any future decision to pay a dividend in respect of our common stock and the amount and timing of any such dividend will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend such factors as they may deem relevant including general economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future alternative deployments of our cash our future capital requirements and contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our holders of shares of our common stock or by our subsidiaries to us in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result a holder of a share of our common stock may not receive any return on such investment unless it is sold for a price greater than that which was paid for it taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock has been affected in part by the research and reports that industry and financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts furthermore if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or our industry change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors or other healthcare sector companies or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

future sales or the perception of future sales of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

as of august 25 2020 13676027 shares of our common stock including a the 13218874 shares of common stock into which outstanding shares of series a preferred stock can be converted the “asconverted shares” and b 453653 shares of restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock issued pursuant to the equity incentive plans we have established for our employees and nonemployee directors representing approximately 77 of the sum of our total outstanding shares of common stock and the asconverted shares are “restricted securities” within the meaning of the sec’s rule 144 under the securities act “rule 144” and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 a registration statement in respect of the offer and sale of the shares of series a preferred stock and asconverted shares by the holders of the series a preferred stock is and remains effective 

in addition as of august 25 2020 2281648 shares of our common stock may become eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options a total of 15600000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our 2018 omnibus incentive plan subject to adjustment for retired and postjune 30 2018 awards under the prior 2014 omnibus incentive plan as of august 25 2020 10533923 shares of our common stock remain available for future issuance under the 2018 omnibus incentive plan these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our equity securities that we wish to issue in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued or issuable in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the nyse or to restrictions set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness the certificate of designation and the stockholders’ agreement any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments acquisitions or otherwise may result in dilution to the holders of shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• until the provision completely sunsets at our annual meeting in respect of fiscal 2021 a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

• advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings though our board of directors has implemented shareholder proxy access 

• certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings 

• the removal of directors serving multiyear terms only for cause and 

• any amendment of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation only by the affirmative vote of at least 6623 of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

provisions such as those just described to the extent that they remain in effect could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares

we are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development and manufacturing solutions for drugs protein cell and gene therapy biologics and consumer health products our oral injectable cell and gene therapy and cell and respiratory delivery technologies address the full diversity of the pharmaceutical industry including small molecules protein cell and gene therapy biologics and consumer health products through our extensive capabilities and deep expertise in product development we can help our customers take products to market faster including nearly half of new drug products approved by the fda in the last decade our advanced delivery technology platforms which include those in our softgel and oral technologies biologics and oral and specialty delivery segments our proven formulation manufacturing and regulatory expertise and our broad and deep intellectual property enable our customers to develop more products and better treatments for patients and consumers across both development and delivery our commitment to reliably supply our customers’ and their patients’ needs is the foundation for the value we provide annually we produce more than 74 billion doses for nearly 7000 customer products or approximately 1 in every 20 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world we believe that through our investments in growthenabling capacity and capabilities our ongoing focus on operational and quality excellence the sales of existing and introduction of new customer products our innovation activities and patents and our entry into new markets we will continue to benefit from attractive and differentiated margins and realize the growth potential from these areas 

in fiscal 2020 we engaged in a business reorganization of our operating segments to better align our internal business unit structure with our “follow the molecule” strategy and the increased focus on our biologicsrelated offerings under the revised structure we changed the components and names of three of our four operating segments with our fourth segment clinical supply services unchanged 

we currently operate in four operating segments which also constitute our four reporting segments softgel and oral technologies  biologics oral and specialty delivery and clinical supply services as further described in business —our reporting segments contained elsewhere in this annual report  

the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has spread across the globe and is affecting economic activity worldwide including in the countries in which we our customers our suppliers and our other business partners conduct business governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement measures to protect public health including quarantines travel restrictions business closures cancellations of public gatherings and measures that affect the flow of goods between different regions we have taken and continue to take steps to avoid or reduce infection or contamination and otherwise protect our employees and our business in line with guidelines issued by the cdc the who and local authorities where we operate to reemphasize good hygiene practices severely restrict nonemployee access to our sites reorganize our workflows where permitted to maximize social distancing limit our employees to only businesscritical travel where permitted by local law facilitate safer alternatives to travel to and from work and employ remoteworking strategies  in addition t o address the multiple dimensions of the pandemic two senior multidisciplinary teams reporting directly to our chief executive officer have been continuously monitoring the global situation executing mitigation activities whenever and wherever required and planning for a phased and structured return to our facilities as circumstances will permit for those employees who have been remoteworking since the pandemic began 

we have reviewed and will continue to analyze our supply chain to identify any risk delay or concern that may have an impact on our ability to deliver our services and products to date we have not identified any significant risk delay or concern that would have a substantial effect on such delivery we have adopted various procedures to minimize and manage any future disruption to our ongoing operations these include procuring expanded safety stocks of raw materials and personal protective equipment across our network as well as ongoing monitoring of our suppliers’ stock levels to assure future deliveries our existing procedures which are consistent with cgmp and other regulatory standards are intended to assure the integrity of our supply against any contamination we have added a detailed response plan to manage any impact of the virus on employee 

health site operations and product supply including immediate assessment of the health of employees reporting symptoms comprehensive risk assessment of any impact to quality additional cleaning protocols and alternative shift patterns to compensate should fewer employees be available 

the covid19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations to date but at this point the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may affect our future financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain and will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain including the duration of the pandemic new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions governments the pharmaceutical industry competitors suppliers customers patients and others may take to contain or address its direct and indirect effects the covid19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures may also have an adverse impact on the healthcare systems global economic conditions or economic conditions in one or more regions where we or our customers operate which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition we have observed some increases in customer delays and cancellations occasional increases in absenteeism of production employees in our facilities in certain affected regions and disruptions in certain clinical trials supported by our clinical supply services segment with a small percentage of our customers expecting a reduction in demand and a larger percentage expecting an increase in demand in each case due to circumstances relating to the covid19 pandemic and the responsive measures we have also seen revenue increases and the potential for further revenue increases related to projects seeking to address the covid19 pandemic or its effects future financial periods may reflect greater effects of the pandemic on the results of our operations

critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements regarding significant areas of judgment management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply development services and clinical supply services on july 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update  “ asu ”  no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  codified as accounting standards codification  “ asc ” 606 using the modified retrospective method of adoption prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies for discussion on the impact of adopting asc 606 on our accounting refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment for our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements due to the regulated nature of our business these contract terms are highly interdependent and therefore are considered to be a single combined performance obligation for our development services and clinical supply services revenue our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations if a contract contains a single performance obligation we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation if a contract contains multiple performance obligations we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the “relative standalone selling price” as defined under asc 606 generally we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration if observable standalone selling prices are not available we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement determining the measure of progress that consistently 

depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment 

licensing revenue 

we occasionally enter into arrangements with customers that include licensing of functional intellectual property including drug formulae or other intangible property “outlicensing” we do not have any material license arrangement that contains more than one performance obligation our outlicensing generally entitles us to nonrefundable upfront fees or royalties nonrefundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when the licensed property is made available for the customer’s use and benefit provided there is no unsatisfied performance obligation included in the arrangement royalty payments from such arrangements are recognized when subsequent sale or usage of an item subject to the royalty occurs and the performance obligation to which royalty relates is satisfied 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with asc 350  intangible and other assets  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed the evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response or if no qualitative assessment is performed a quantitative assessment based upon discounted cash flows is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions in fiscal 2018 and 2020 we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment but in fiscal 2019 we began with the qualitative assessment the evaluations performed in fiscal 2018 2019 and 2020 resulted in no impairment charge  

see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

series a preferred stock dividend adjustment feature 

the terms of the series a preferred stock include a dividend adjustment feature to provide the holders with certain protections against a decline in the trading price of our common stock because this adjustment feature depends in part on the value of external metrics at future dates over which we have no control this feature is accounted for separately from the rest of the series a preferred stock as a derivative instrument which is measured at fair value as of the valuation date using a combination of i a monte carlo simulation and ii a binomial lattice model which incorporates the terms and conditions of the series a preferred stock and is based on changes in the market prices of shares of our common stock over successive periods key assumptions used in both models include the current market price of one share of the common stock and its historical and expected volatility riskneutral interest rates and the remaining term of the adjustment feature the calculation of the estimated fair value of the derivative liability is highly sensitive to changes in the unobservable inputs such as the expected volatility and the company’s specific credit spread  we recognize the derivative as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and revalue it as of the end of each quarterly reporting period changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

income taxes 

in accordance wit h asc 740 income taxes  we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and the corresponding financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in fiscal 2018 we recorded a provision for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 tax act but we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2020  

the 2017 tax act imposed taxes on socalled “global intangible lowtaxed income” “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a us company in accordance with asc 740 we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred 

we assess the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering all available evidence both positive and negative in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluate four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

• carrybacks of existing nols if and to the extent permitted by tax law 

• future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 

• tax planning strategies and 

• future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 

we consider the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets as a result of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law 

unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution 

our accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the us and in each of the nonus jurisdictions in which we operate particularly european tax jurisdictions the determination of income subject to taxation in each taxpaying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate in addition the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction for those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates we apply transferpricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions the estimates and assumptions used in these allocations can result in uncertainty in the measured tax benefit 

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our annual financial reporting periods end on june 30 our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental europe and the uk the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms in fiscal 2018 we acquired catalent indiana in order to enhance our biologics capabilities and it has been integrated into our biologics segment in fiscal 2019 we completed the acquisitions of juniper based in the uk in august 2018 and of a gene therapy business based in the us in may 2019 which have been integrated into our oral and specialty delivery and biologics segments respectively in fiscal 2020 we completed the acquisitions of additional usbased gene therapy assets from novavax in july 2019 and masthercell based in belgium and the us in february 2020 which have been integrated into our biologics segment we also completed the acquisition of the anagni facility based in italy in january 2020 which has been integrated into our oral and specialty delivery and biologics segments 

foreign exchange rates 

our operating network is global and as a result we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the currency in which we report our financial results and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 approximately 41 of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the united states significant foreign currencies for our operations include the british pound european euro brazilian real argentine peso japanese yen and the canadian dollar 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry which has been estimated to generate more than 1 trillion in annual revenue including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in earlystage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals biologics and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

nongaap metrics 

as described in this section management uses various financial metrics including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in us gaap to measure and assess the performance of our business to make critical business decisions and to assess our compliance with certain financial obligations we therefore believe that presentation of certain of these nongaap metrics in this annual report will aid investors in understanding our business 

ebitda from operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense expensebenefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted for the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  “ ebitda from operations ”  ebitda from operations is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of noncash depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the consolidated financial statements and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the most directly comparable measure to ebitda from operations defined under us gaap is net earningsloss included in this management’s discussion and analysis is a reconciliation of net earningsloss to ebitda from operations 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other incomeexpense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expensebenefit and depreciation and amortization  “ segment ebitda ”  

adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement and the indentures the ability of operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “ consolidated ebitda ” in the credit agreement and “ebitda” in the indentures adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement and indentures particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is based on the definitions in the credit agreement is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

in addition we use adjusted ebitda as a performance metric that guides management in its operation of and planning for the future of the business and drives certain management compensation programs management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a useful measure of our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core business including interest expense and noncash charges like depreciation and amortization 

the measure under us gaap most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net earningsloss in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are deducted when calculating ebitda from operations and net earnings consistent with the requirements of the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things 

• does not include noncash stockbased employee compensation expense and certain other noncash charges 

• does not include cash and noncash restructuring severance and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance operations 

• adds back any noncontrolling interest expense which represents minority investors’ ownership of nonwholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and is therefore not available and 

• includes estimated cost savings that have not yet been fully reflected in our results 

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share 

we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share which we sometimes refer to as “ adjusted eps ” as performance metrics adjusted net income is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations we believe that providing information concerning adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe that these measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use these measures for business planning and executive compensation purposes we define adjusted net income as net earningsloss adjusted for 1 earnings or loss from discontinued operations net of tax 2 amortization attributable to purchase accounting and 3 income or loss from noncontrolling interest in majorityowned operations we also make adjustments for other cash and noncash items as shown above in “—adjusted ebitda” partially offset by our estimate of the tax effects as a result of such cash and noncash items our definition of adjusted net income may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies adjusted net income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

summary twoyear key financial performance metrics 

the below tables summarize our results in fiscal 2020 and 2019 on several financial metrics we use to measure performance refer to the discussions below regarding performance and the use of key financial metrics and “—n ongaap metrics —use of constant currency” concerning the measurement of revenue at “ constant currency ” 

fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 were as follows 



net revenue 

net revenue increased by 6122 million or 24 excluding the impact of foreign exchange compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2019 net revenue increased 14 as a result of acquisitions which was partially offset by a 2 decrease in net revenue due to a facility divestiture we acquired juniper in august 2018 various gene therapy assets in may and july 2019 the anagni facility in january 2020 and masthercell in february 2020 and divested a manufacturing site in australia in october 2019 net revenue increased 12 without the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on a constant currency basis primarily related to volume increases across all of our segments 

gross margin 

gross margin increased by 1881 million or 23 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily as a result of our acquisitions and increased volumes as discussed above on a constantcurrency basis gross margin as a percentage of net revenue decreased 10 basis points to 318 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to 319 in the corresponding prioryear period primarily due to recent acquisitions 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 689 million or 13 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily driven by acquisitionrelated expenses during the year including transaction fees of 59 million related to the acquisitions of our gene therapy business anagni and masthercell additionally there were incremental selling general and administrative expenses from the acquired companies of 809 million primarily driven by 280 million of depreciation and amortization expense and 217 million of employeerelated costs selling general and administrative expenses further increased approximately 113 million for noncash equitybased compensation driven by the achievement of certain performancebased metrics during the fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense attributable to prioryear amortization of 130 million related to licensing rights within our oral and specialty delivery segment and a 31 million decrease related to the october 2019 divestiture of an australian facility within our softgel and oral technologies segment 

impairment charges and loss on sale of assets 

impairment charges for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 and june 30 2019 were 55 million and 51 million respectively impairment charges in the current year were primarily driven by the sale of the company’s facility in braeside australia the prior year impairment charges were driven by a softwarerelated intangible asset in our clinical supply services segment that was not implemented and whose value therefore was not fully recoverable 

restructuring and other 

restructuring and other charges of 55 million in fiscal 2020 decreased by 86 million compared to the amounts in fiscal 2019 and were driven by employeerelated actions restructuring expenses varies periodtoperiod based on site consolidation efforts and other efforts to further streamline the business 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 1261 million in fiscal 2020 increased by 155 million or 14 compared to fiscal 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily driven by an increase in outstanding indebtedness driven by operating company’s june 2019 offering of the usd 2027 notes and its february 2020 offering of the euro 2028 notes the increase was partially offset by savings in both interest paid and in interest rate due to repayment of operating company’s eurodenominated term loans and eurodenominated 475 senior notes due 2024 the “euro 2024 notes” 

for additional information concerning our debt and financing arrangements including the changing mi x of debt and equity in our capital structure see “—liquidity and capital resources—debt and financing arrangements” and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

a component of the purchase price for the acquisition of catalent indiana in fiscal 2018 consisted of 2000 million in deferred purchase consideration payable in four annual 500 million installments on the first four anniversary dates of the acquisition we made the two first such payments in october 2018 and october 2019 and the present value of the balance is accounted for as debt with the difference between the nominal value and the present value considered imputed interest expense 

other expense net   

other expense net of 79 million for fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by financing charges of 163 million the financing charges included a 63 million writeoff of previously capitalized financing charges related to operating company’s recently repaid eurodenominated term loan under its senior secured credit facilities and the recently redeemed euro 2024 notes and a 100 million premium on early redemption of the euro 2024 notes the loss was partially offset by a foreign currency gain of 30 million and a derivative gain of 32 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the series a preferred stock 

other expense net for fiscal 2019 of 27 million was primarily driven by financing charges of 158 million related to the offering of the usd 2027 notes and was partially offset by a gain of 129 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the series a preferred stock and 05 million of 

unrealized foreign currency gains in the year see notes 9 and 13 to the consolidated financial statement for more details on the series a preferred stock dividend adjustment 

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 was 397 million relative to earnings before income taxes of 2604 million our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 was 229 million relative to earnings before income taxes of 1603 million the income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year primarily due to changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions as well as the impact of discrete items including equity compensation generally fluctuations in our effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items including the reversal portions of federal and foreign valuation allowances which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item 

segment review 

the below charts depict the percentage of net revenue from each of our four reporting segments for the previous two years refer below for discussions regarding the segments ’ net revenue and ebitda performance and to “— nongaap metrics ” for a discussion of our use of segment ebitda a measure that is not defined under us gaap  

our results on a segment basis for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 were as follows 



1 unallocated costs include restructuring and special items equitybased compensation impairment charges certain other corporatedirected costs and other costs that are not allocated to the segments as follows 



a restructuring and other special items include fiscal 2020 transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisitions of catalent maryland the anagni facility and masthercell 

b other expense net of 79 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 was primarily driven by financing charges of 141 million related to i a 60 million writeoff of previously capitalized financing charges related to operating company’s recently repaid eurodenominated term loan under its senior secured credit facilities and recently redeemed euro 2024 notes and ii a 100 million premium on early redemption of the euro 2024 notes this was partially offset by i a derivative gain of 32 million arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the series a preferred stock and ii 30 million of foreign currency gains in the year 

provided below is a reconciliation of net earnings to ebitda from operations 



softgel and oral technologies segment 



net revenue in our softgel and oral technologies segment increased by 441 million or 4 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange net revenue increased 8 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 excluding the impact of divestitures the increase relates to continued strong demand across our portfolio of prescription products within north america which is partially attributable to recently launched products demand for our portfolio of consumer health products continues predominantly within europe 

softgel and oral technologies’ segment ebitda increased by 247 million or 10 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange segment ebitda increased 13 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 excluding the impact of divestitures the increase primarily relates to the demand increase across our portfolio of highermargin prescription products within north america as well as our consumer health business in line with the revenue growth within europe 

in october 2019 we divested a manufacturing site in australia in the softgel and oral technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations the site divestiture resulted in a decrease in net revenue of 4 and segment ebitda of 3 in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 

biologics segment 



net revenue in our biologics segment increased by 4531 million or 79 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange excluding the effect of acquisitions the net revenue increase was driven primarily by strong endmarket demand for our us drug product and us drug substance offerings with the former being delivered through improved capacity utilization additional site readiness activities related to covid19 vaccination programs across our gene therapy us drug product and us drug substance offerings also contributed towards the net revenue increase drug substance growth was partially offset by the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for noncell line clinical manufacturing services as well as softening demand for our european drug product offering 

biologics segment ebitda increased by 914 million or 62 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 excluding the impact of foreign exchange segment ebitda excluding the effect of acquisitions increased 26 from the corresponding prioryear period primarily due to increased demand for our us drug product offering as well as site readiness activities related to covid19 vaccination programs across our gene therapy us drug product and us drug substance offerings segment ebitda growth was partially offset by decreased volume for our us drug substance product offering predominantly due to the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for noncell line clinical manufacturing services and softening demand for our european drug product offering 

beginning in may 2019 we acquired the assets comprising our gene therapy business in january 2020 we acquired the anagni facility part of which operates within the biologics segment and in february 2020 we acquired masthercell together these acquisitions increased net revenue and segment ebitda on an inorganic basis in our biologics segment by 52 and 36 respectively in the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 compared to the corresponding prioryear period

interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities in april 2020 we entered into an interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variableinterest obligation associated with our us dollardenominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt became fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on future interest expense the applicable rate for the us dollardenominated term loan is libor subject to a floor of 100 plus 225 however as a result of entering into the interestrate swap agreement the floating portion of the applicable rate on 5000 million of the term loan is now effectively fixed at 126 for a total fixed rate of 351 

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate on our investments in our foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2020 we had 9099 million of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

from time to time we may use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future

7 primarily relates to certain longterm employeerelated liabilities for operations under programs that we have discontinued 

the table excludes our retirement and other postemployment benefits  “ opeb ”  obligations the timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans in fiscal 2021 we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards beyond fiscal 2021 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are generally paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and principally depend on the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

we have historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variablerate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense 

in april 2020 we entered into an interestrate swap agreement with bank of america na as a hedge against the economic effect of a portion of the variableinterest obligation associated with our us dollardenominated term loans under our senior secured credit facilities so that the interest payable on that portion of the debt becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on future interest expense the applicable rate for the us dollardenominated term loan is libor subject to a floor of 100 plus 225 however as a result of entering into the interestrate swap agreement the floating portion of the applicable rate on 5000 million of the term loan is now effectively fixed at 126 for a total fixed rate of 351 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchangerate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products throughout the world our foreigncurrency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreignexchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso and brazilian real our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars our functional currency the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency except in argentina a hyperinflationary economy where our results are measured in us dollars adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss utilizing periodend exchange rates foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in other incomeexpense net such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

history 

we were formed in april 2007 when affiliates of the blackstone group lp “blackstone” acquired the core of the pharmaceutical technologies and services “pts” segment of cardinal health inc “cardinal” cardinal had created pts through a series of acquisitions beginning with rp scherer corporation in 1998 we are a holding company that indirectly owns catalent pharma solutions inc “operating company” which owns directly or indirectly all of our operating subsidiaries since the 2007 acquisition of pts we have regularly reviewed our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan and as a result we have sold seven businesses and consolidated operations at five facilities integrating them into the remaining facility network in fiscal 2018 we agreed to sell our facility in braeside australia and we expect to close that transaction in the first half of fiscal 2020 we have also actively acquired new businesses and facilities in july 2014 we completed the initial public offering the “ipo” of our common stock par value 001 the “common stock” which is listed on the new york stock exchange the “nyse” under the symbol “ctlt” blackstone and its minority partners sold all of the stock they held in us in a series of secondary offerings ending in september 2016 

our competitive strengths 

leading provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions 

we are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs biologics and consumer and animal health products in the last decade we have earned revenue with respect to nearly half of the drugs based on new molecular entities  “ nmes ”  approved by the fda and over the past three years with respect to more than 80 of the top 200 largestselling compounds globally with approximately 2400 scientists and technicians worldwide and more than 1300 patents and patent applications our expertise is in providing differentiated technologies and solutions that help our customers bring more products and better treatments to market faster for example in the highvalue area of new chemical entities  “ nces ”  approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us 

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope our large customer base the extensive range of products we produce our broad service offerings and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of a product ’ s lifecycle in fiscal 2019 we produced nearly 7000 distinct items across multiple categories our fiscal 2019 regulatorybased classification of revenues demonstrates this branded drugs 34 generic prescription drugs 7 protein and gene therapy biologics 32 overthecounter drugs 13 and consumer health veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics 14 combined in fiscal 2019 our top 20 products represented approximately 20 of total revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of revenue and with no individual product greater than 4 we serve more than 1000 customers in approximately 80 countries with nearly half of our fiscal 2019 revenues coming from outside the united states this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payerdriven pricing pressures experienced by our drug and biologic customers 

longstanding extensive relationships with blue chip customers 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2019 we did business with 83 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 21 of the top 25 generics marketers 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 21 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally as well as with more than 1000 other customers including emerging and specialty companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs 

we believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers 

deep broad and growing technology foundation 

our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants our leading softgel platforms including liquigels optishell and vegicaps capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family and our optipact and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory ophthalmic and injectable routes including the blowfillseal unit dose technology and prefilled syringes we also provide advanced biologics formulation options including “gpex” cellline and smartag antibodydrug conjugate technologies and aav vectors for gene therapies we have a market leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and nebulized and intranasal forms we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last five years as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications including the fiscal 2016 launch of our optiform solution suite a dose formagnostic bioavailability enhancement program for earlystage molecules and the recent acquisitions of catalent indiana which expands our biologics platform and paragon which extends our biologics business into gene therapy our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies our scientists and engineers and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network our global product development team drives a focused application of resources to our highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development  as of june 30 2019 we had approximately 1100 product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final formulations and dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years see “— contractual arrangements ” for more detail approximately twothirds of our fiscal 2019 advanced delivery technology platform revenues comprised of our softgel technologies biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage 

significant recent growth investments 

we have made significant investments over time to establish a manufacturing network capable of serving customers and patients worldwide and today employ 64 million square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space across five continents we have deployed approximately 8150 million in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive ongoing and continuous improvements in safety productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  “ cgmp ”  or other applicable requirements following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have more than 1900 employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance all of our facilities are registered with the fda or other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines 

agency the “ ema ”  in some cases facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies in fiscal 2019 we were subject to 75 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed approximately 300 regulatory audits we also undergo more than 400 customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a favorable competitive differentiator 

strong and experienced management team 

our executive leadership team collectively has more than 200 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of more than 29 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships 

our strategy 

we are pursuing the following key growth initiatives 

“ follow the molecule ” ® providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for early preclinical development of small molecules biologics and antibodydrug conjugates to formulation and analytical services through clinical development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for therapeutic trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing expertise that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in appropriate dosage forms the relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life including with additional customers through potential generic launches or overthecounter conversion for prescription products we are typically the sole andor exclusive provider and are reflected in customers’ new drug applications our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of an innovator drug’s market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply both branded and generic customers 

an example of this can be found in a leading overthecounter respiratory brand which today uses both our zydis fast dissolve and our liquigels softgel technologies we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription zydis product for six years and we have continued to provide the zydis form since the switch to overthecounter status in the united states and other markets in the early 2000s subsequently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 27yearlong relationship across multiple formats and markets 

customer product pipeline — continuing to grow through new projects and product launches 

we intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized advanced delivery technology products with new development programs as of june 30 2019 our product development teams were working on approximately 1100 new customer programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our expanded capabilities and technologies although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical biological and consumer and animal health products we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in fiscal 2019 we introduced 193 new products for our customers 

catalent continues to be the global leader in providing chemistry manufacturing and controlsbased product development services to the global pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health industry driven by thousands of projects annually in fiscal 2019 we recognized approximately 6530 million of revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers included in our softgel technologies biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery reporting segments up 27 from the prior year in addition substantially all of the revenues associated with the clinical supply services segment relate to our support of customer products in development 

capabilities  capacity — expanding in biologics and other attractive markets 

recognizing the strategic importance of biologics we began to build a differentiated biologics cellline and formulation development platform in 2002 since then we have invested over 22 billion in our biologics business including capital 

investments the fiscal 2019 acquisition of paragon for an aggregate nominal purchase price of 12 billion and the fiscal 2018 acquisition of catalent indiana for an aggregate nominal purchase price of 9500 million and we have commenced a 2000 million capital investment at our sites in bloomington and madison to expand drug substance manufacturing capacity and drug product fillfinish capacity due to projected growth among our existing and future customers today we are a recognized leader in biologics including aav vectors for gene therapies advanced cellline development formulation and fillfinish into prefilled syringes vials and cartridges and increasingly in specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substance for use in clinical trials and bioanalytical analysis the third production suite in our madison wisconsin facility came online in fiscal 2018 taking us to commercial scale supply for biologics drug substance we have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for nearly 700 cell lines many using our advanced gpex technology and we have invested in a secondgeneration antibodydrug conjugate technology smartag and we see continued progress in our customers’ smartag productdevelopment activities 

in addition to our expansion in biologics we have invested additional capital in several existing nonbiological facilities in order to expand in attractive markets including a recently completed significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in winchester kentucky the scalingup of commercial manufacturing capacity for metereddose inhalers and our commencement of a 270 million capital investment to commercialize our nextgeneration orally disintegrating tablet odt technology zydis ultra we have also added key new capabilities in early development via our fiscal 2019 acquisition of juniper pharmaceuticals and our fiscal 2017 acquisition of pharmatek and expanded our north american consumer health softgel capacity via our fiscal 2017 accucaps acquisition 

advanced technologies — capitalize on our substantial platforms 

we have broad and diverse technology platforms that are supported by extensive knowhow and more than 1300 patents and patent applications in approximately 125 families across advanced delivery technologies drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation knowhow databases of formulated products and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us 

in addition to resolving delivery challenges for our customers’ products for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proofofconcept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for selfcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

operational leverage — deploy existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our lean manufacturing and lean six sigma programs a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability we intend to continue to apply this discipline to leverage further our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2009 we have expanded gross margin by over 400 basis points and adjusted ebitda margin by over 400 basis points note that “ adjusted ebitda ” is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  “ us gaap ”  and that further explanations of this metric and comparisons to the most nearly comparable us gaap metrics are set forth below at “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—historical and adjusted ebitda ” 

strategic acquisitions and licensing — build on our existing platform 

we operate in highly fragmented markets in both our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions businesses within those markets the five top players represent approximately 35 and 10 of the total market share respectively by revenue our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets and to generate operating leverage through such acquisitions since fiscal 2013 we have executed ten transactions investing approximately 27 billion and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

while we are rigorously focused on driving catalent’s organic growth we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolton strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments we have a dedicated corporate 

development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions

integrated development and product supply chain solutions 

in addition to our proprietary offerings we are also differentiated in the market by our ability to bring together our development solutions and advanced delivery technologies to offer innovative development and product supply solutions that can be combined or tailored in many ways to enable our customers to take their drugs biologics and consumer health products from laboratory to market once a product is on the market we can provide comprehensive integrated product supply from the sourcing of the bulk active ingredient to comprehensive manufacturing and packaging to the testing required for release to distribution the customer and productspecific solutions we develop are flexible scalable and creative so that they meet the unique needs of both large and emerging companies and are appropriate for products of all sizes we believe that our development and product supply solutions such as optiform solutions suite and onebiosuite will continue to contribute to our future growth 

sales and marketing 

our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and consumer health companies along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices and companies in adjacent industries such as cosmetics we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2019 we did business with 83 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 21 of the top 25 generics marketers 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 21 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally as well as with more than 1000 other customers faced with access pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities while reducing their fixed cost base many midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies while facing the same pricing and market pressures have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills technologies and services required to bring their products to market consumer health companies require rapidly developed innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up with the fastpaced overthecounter medication vitamins and personal care markets these market segments are all important to our growth but require distinct solutions marketing and sales approaches and market strategy 

we follow a hybrid demandgeneration organization model with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering our sales organization currently consists of more than 150 fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings as part of our marketing efforts we participate in major trade shows relevant to our offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and universe of target customers and that our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us 

global accounts 

we manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential we recorded approximately 20 of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 from these global accounts each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to produce their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of these customers 

seasonality fluctuations in operation results 

our annual financial reporting periods end on june 30 our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental europe and the uk the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses and quality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the 

offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice minimum volume commitments royalties profitsharing and fixed fees we employ a range of capacity access approaches from standard to completely dedicated capacity models based on customer and product needs we generally secure pricing and other contract mechanisms in our supply agreements to allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements permit us to renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials we use to make products our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions the terms of our manufacturing supply agreements range from three to seven years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our softgel technologies biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our clinical supply services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2019 our backlog was 13498 million compared to 11123 million as of june 30 2018 including 3663 million and 2732 million respectively related to our clinical supply services segment we expect to recognize approximately 85 of revenue from the backlog in existence as of june 30 2019 by the completion of fiscal year ending 2020 

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world as of june 30 2019 we had thirtynine facilities four geographical locations operate as multiple facilities because they support more than one reporting segment on five continents with 64 million square feet of manufacturing laboratory and related space in addition in may 2019 we signed an agreement to acquire a facility in anagni italy that produces both oral and sterile dose forms for drugs and biologics which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and in june 2019 we signed an agreement to acquire two facilities in southern maryland from novavax inc to supplement the capabilities of paragon particularly in earlystage development this acquisition closed in late july 2019 our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

we operate our plants in accordance with cgmp or other applicable requirements all of our facilities are registered with the fda or other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases our facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested 5344 million in our manufacturing facilities since fiscal 2017 through improvements and expansions in our facilities including 2181 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 we believe that our facilities and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2019 we achieved approximately 97 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including lean six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for our softgel technologies segment packaging films for our clinical supply services segment and glass vials and syringes for injectable fillfinish along with resin for our blowfillseal business in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment the raw materials that we use are sourced 

externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics or geopolitical and other issues for example commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy  “ bse ”  have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers any future restriction that were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval periods 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see “ risk factors—risks relating to our business and industry— our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials ” 

competition 

we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including with other companies that offer conventional and advanced delivery technologies clinical trials support outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally 

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed while we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings and a few competitors that compete across many of our offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable company 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements costs incurred in connection with the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses such research and development costs included in selling general and administrative expenses amounted to 33 million 63 million and 70 million for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively costs incurred in connection with research and development services we provide to customers and services performed in support of the commercial manufacturing process for customers are recorded within cost of sales such research and development costs included in cost of sales amounted to 512 million 462 million and 458 million for fiscal years ended 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

employees 

as of june 30 2019 we had nearly 12300 employees in thirtynine facilities on five continents fifteen facilities are in the united states with certain employees at one facility being represented by a labor organization with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all thirteen of our european facilities consistent with labor environmentslaws in european countries similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist at our plants in argentina australia brazil and canada our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory

responsible business practices are essential to fulfilling our mission of helping people live better healthier lives our corporate values are at the foundation of our culture and everything we do our explicit commitment to patient first means that we put patients at the center of our work to ensure the safety reliable supply and optimal performance of our products 

we ask employees at every level of our organization to uphold these values and to apply the highest ethical standards in their work investing in our people managing our environmental footprint and giving back to our communities are part of our longterm growth and sustainability strategy and guide our corporate responsibility cr program 

governance 

to manage our cr performance we maintain a cr council made up of executive and senior leadership to guide the implementation of our cr strategy and commitments and report to our board of directors or a designated committee on cr matters three committees reporting to the cr council—the environmental committee the grantmaking committee and the community engagement ambassador network—help drive progress in three critical areas of our overall cr commitment and embed cr deeper into our business 

significant initiatives 

we focus on those aspects within the overall corporate responsibility area that we believe to be most significant to our business our view is informed by stakeholder feedback regulatory developments and issues that appear to engage our constituencies from time to time we assess and prioritize among potential initiatives in order to focus our resources relevant issues on which we have focused during fiscal 2019 include 

• community investment and philanthropy 

▪ diversity and inclusion 

▪ energy use and climate change 

▪ occupational health and safety 

▪ product innovation

progress in 2019 

in fiscal 2019 we continued to introduce an expanded set of sitebased cr performance metrics to measure the impact of our cr activities across our network as part of this exercise we conducted our most comprehensive environmental baseline assessment to date our environmental data and other relevant cr metrics and targets will be shared as part of our first cr report which is expected in 2020 catalent has also achieved global accreditation with respect to the international management standards for environment iso140012015 and occupational safety ohsas180012007 

in april 2019 our second annual earth month campaign catalent unplugged emphasized our focus on reducing co₂ emissions linked to energy use our employees and sites responded enthusiastically organizing volunteering recycling awarenessraising and waste elimination initiatives across the network 

our catalent month of service grew to include almost every site in the catalent network we expanded our community grant making program focused on giving back through our diverse network of facilities worldwide our grants promote local organizations that support patients and encourage stem science technology engineering and mathematics educational and training initiatives catalent’s disaster response program is valued by our employees for helping people affected by natural disasters in the us and beyond 

further information on our cr program is available at httpswwwcatalentcomindexphpaboutuscorporateresponsibility but this website is not part of our public disclosures and is not incorporated by reference into this annual report 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings services and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations certain of our operations and products are under intellectual property licenses from third parties and in certain instances we license our technology to third parties we also have a long track record of innovation across our lines of business and to further encourage active innovation we have developed incentive compensation systems linked to patent filings and other recognition and reward programs for scientists and nonscientists alike 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered and issued and also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks we hold more than 1300 patents and patent applications worldwide relating to advanced drug delivery and biologics formulations and technologies as well as manufacturing and other areas relevant to our business 

we hold patents and license rights relating to certain aspects of our formulations nutritional and pharmaceutical dosage forms mammalian cell engineering and sterile manufacturing services we also hold patents relating to certain processes and products we have a number of pending patent applications in the united states and certain other countries and intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate we have enforced and will continue to enforce our intellectual property rights in the united states and worldwide 

we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

regulatory matters 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of healthcare products and the provision of certain services for developmentstage pharmaceutical and biotechnology products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda other us governmental authorities and foreign regulatory authorities certain of our subsidiaries are required to register for permits or licenses with and must comply with the operating cgmp quality and security standards of applicable domestic and foreign healthcare regulators including the fda the us drug enforcement agency the “ dea ”  the us department of health and human services the “ dhhs ”  the equivalent agencies of the european union the “ eu ”  and its member states and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments and comparable foreign agencies as well as various accrediting bodies each depending upon the type of operations and the locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to other healthcare laws including the us federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act the controlled substances act and comparable state and foreign laws and regulations in certain of their activities 

we are also subject to various federal state local foreign and transnational laws regulations and requirements both in the united states and abroad relating to safe working conditions laboratory and distribution practices and the use transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in addition us and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the crossborder transit of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we are also subject to various other laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

the costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal state local foreign and transnational regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition see “ risk factors—risks relating to our business and industry— failure to 

comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers ” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations 

in fiscal 2019 we were subject to 75 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed approximately 300 regulatory audits 

quality assurance 

we are committed to ensuring and maintaining the highest standard of regulatory compliance while providing high quality products to our customers to meet these commitments we have developed and implemented a catalentwide quality management system we have more than 1900 employees around the globe focusing on quality and regulatory compliance our senior management team is actively involved in setting quality policies standards and internal position papers as well as managing internal and external quality performance our quality assurance department provides quality leadership and supervises our quality systems programs an internal audit program monitors compliance with applicable regulations standards and internal policies in addition our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda the dea and other equivalent local state and foreign regulatory authorities as well as our customers all fda dea and other regulatory inspectional observations have been resolved or are on track to be completed at the prescribed timeframe provided in commitments to the applicable agency in all material respects we believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with the regulations under which our facilities are governed 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the us environmental protection agency the “ epa ”  and equivalent state local and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety our manufacturing facilities use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us for which we have recorded appropriate reserves as needed we believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with the environment health and safety regulations applicable to our facilities 




 item 1a risk factors 

if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including competing with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing clinical trials support services or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally 

we face substantial competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed some competitors may have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customers’ requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon among other things available resources and their need to develop new products which in turn is dependent upon a number of factors including their competitors’ research development and production initiatives and the anticipated market uptake clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas in addition consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations including research and development departments and their budgets our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers we have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the amount of available policy limits require larger selfinsured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims 

we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 250 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability or other claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we and our customers are subject to various local state federal national and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs similar bodies of the eu and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world and in the future any change to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us among other rules affecting us we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cgmp and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits or licenses and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the fda the dea the dhhs exus agencies including the ema and various boards of pharmacy health departments or comparable agencies in various jurisdictions around the world as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our offerings are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal national and transnational regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals permits or registrations including those relating to products or facilities in addition any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant customers may also claim loss of profits due to lost or delayed sales although our contracts generally place substantial limits on such claims there can be no assurance that any such contractual limitation will be applicable sufficient or fully enforced in any given situation 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical or medical device must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal national and transnational regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions that regulate our offerings and products we or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new offerings or products for any number of reasons 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us or our customers with applicable law or regulation or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore loss of a permit license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions or costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design formulation development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the products we supply quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution or restrictions on our operations monetary fines or other civil or criminal sanctions in addition such an issue could subject us to costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses the cost of which could be significant 

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our softgel technologies biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery segments due in part to strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses time and expense spent investigating the cause lost production time and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation 

our global operations are subject to economic political and regulatory risks including the risks of changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards that could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global and regional economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition including potential competition from manufacturers in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain our customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such mitigating measures may be unavailable costly or unsuccessful 

the exit of the uk from the european union could have future adverse effects on our operations revenues and costs and therefore our profitability 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved the uk’s exit from the eu and the uk government has invoked its right to withdraw effective in march 2019 this deadline for withdrawal has since been extended by agreement to october 2019 there is no immediate change in either the uk or the eu as a result of either action but the uk government is now engaged in both internal and external discussions with affected parties and considering additional legislation regarding the changes that will result from the decision to exit five of our facilities employing hundreds of workers are located in the uk and these facilities as well as others in our network source goods manufacture goods and provide services from or intended for the uk these facilities operate within an existing framework of trade and human capital integration with the eu and by extension the other parts of the world with which the eu has trade and immigration agreements furthermore some of our facilities located in other eu member states ship materials to and from or otherwise engage in various business interactions with the uk including our uk facilities due to future changes in the uk resulting from an eventual exit including potentially increased trade barriers increased tariff rates or custom duties or in anticipation of such changes our suppliers customers or employees may change their interactions with us including changes in imports to or exports from the uk changes in the requested utilization of our facilities both within and without the uk and changes in our relationships with our workforce in the uk to the extent that our facilities operate as part of a crossborder supply and distribution chain their operations may also be negatively affected by a decrease in the crossborder mobility of goods and services we cannot anticipate the nature of these changes as they largely depend on factors outside our control but the changes may result in adverse changes in our future operations revenues and costs and therefore our future profitability 

if we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies to the extent that such technologies are 

protected by patents their related offerings may become subject to competition as the patents expire without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings and technologies our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations 

the success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

• properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs including increasing demand for lower cost products 

• enhance innovate develop and manufacture new offerings in an economical and timely manner 

• differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings 

• achieve positive clinical outcomes for our customers’ new products 

• meet safety requirements and other regulatory requirements of governmental agencies 

• obtain valid and enforceable intellectual property rights and 

• avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 

even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks knowhow trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect many of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will provide uniqueness or meaningful competitive differentiation in our offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur which may force us to compete with third parties thereby negatively affecting our revenue and profitability we do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any patent currently protecting our business 

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of such proceedings may be unfavorable to us 

any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

we have applied in the united states and certain other countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered or issued and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and 

service marks in the past third parties have occasionally opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the united states or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

license agreements with third parties control our rights to use certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies owned by third parties some of which are important to our business termination of these license agreements for any reason could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property causing an adverse change in our operations or the inability to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the united states for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents if the patents on which our customers rely were successfully challenged and as a result the affected products become subject to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings 

our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future 

while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and certain other countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claim that our offerings or processes infringe thirdparty intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of the claim’s merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters if any such claim results in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to 

• pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages in the united states 

• cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing offerings or processes 

• discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

• expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology 

• license technology from the third party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or may not be available at all and 

• lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others 

in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings this includes but is not limited to gelatin starch iota carrageenan petroleumbased products and resin also our customers frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product it is possible that any of our or our customers’ supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements import or export restrictions natural disasters international supply disruptions caused by pandemics geopolitical issues operational or quality issues at the suppliers’ facilities and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin is a critical component in most of the products produced in our softgel technologies segment gelatin is available from only a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from bse or otherwise any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for or public sentiment towards our customers’ products in the united states or internationally or other changes in applicable policies regarding the healthcare industry including possible changes to the affordable care act the “ aca ”  in the united states could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by affecting demand for our offerings 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings that they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for these offerings in particular there is significant uncertainty about the likelihood of changes to the aca and healthcare laws in general in the united states including future legislation that may affect or put a cap on future pricing of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products while we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the aca any substantial revision of this or other healthcare legislation could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers’ products which in turn could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or business changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices or in public or government sentiment for the industry as a whole could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

as a global enterprise fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar our reporting currency against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations  

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including our eurodenominated 475 senior notes due 2024 and a portion of our senior secured credit facilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar which is the currency that we use to report our financial results as a result changes in the exchange rates of these or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates affecting the various currencies in which we do business including as a result of the uk’s referendum to exit from the eu such volatility and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies 

tax legislative or regulatory initiatives new interpretations or developments concerning existing tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and several international jurisdictions including canada south america europe and the asiapacific region as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations 

of the us federal state and local governments and of many jurisdictions outside of the us from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and existing legislation such as the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” may be subject to additional regulatory changes or new interpretations  there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition us federal state local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that relevant tax authorities will not challenge our tax positions or that we would succeed in defending against any such challenge 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we have in the past sustained net operating losses that we may use to reduce future taxable income utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “internal revenue code ”  and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an “ ownership change ” generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange net operating losses to reduce its postchange income may be limited we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce us federal and state taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

changes to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net us deferred tax assets 

we have deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently do not maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets we may experience in the future a decline in us federal taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new and enhanced offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel or a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on approximately 150 senior employees to lead and direct our business our senior leadership team  “ slt ”  is comprised of our and our subsidiaries’ executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market the members of the slt hold positions such as facility general manager vice presidentgeneral manager of business unit commercial development vice president of quality and regulatory activities and vice presidentfinance 

with respect to our technical talent we have more than 2400 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like those in which our morrisville north carolina brussels belgium woodstock illinois madison wisconsin emeryville california bloomington indiana nottingham uk and schorndorf germany facilities are located global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

we use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations compile and analyze financial and operational data and communicate among our employees customers and counterparties and the risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations we are continuously working to install new and upgrade existing systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber security risks to enhance the protections available to us but such protections may be inadequate to address malicious attacks or inadvertent compromises of data security 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain process analyze and manage data to 

• facilitate the manufacture and distribution of thousands of inventory items in to and from our facilities 

• receive process and ship orders on a timely basis 

• manage the accurate billing and collections for more than one thousand customers 

• create compile and retain testing and other product manufacturing or facilityrelated data necessary for meeting our and our customers’ regulatory obligations 

• manage the accurate accounting and payment for thousands of vendors 

• schedule and operate our global network of development manufacturing and packaging facilities 

• document various aspects of our activities including the agreements we make with suppliers and customers 

• compile financial and other operational data into reports necessary to manage our business and comply with various regulatory or contractual obligations including obligations under our bank loans and other indebtedness the federal securities laws the code and other applicable state local and exus tax laws and 

• communicate among our nearly 12300 employees spread across thirtynine facilities over five continents 

we deploy defenses against cyberattack and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques hardware and software typical of companies of our size and scope despite our security measures however our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by increasingly sophisticated intruders or others who try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems they are also susceptible to breach due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged or fail for any extended period 

we engage from time to time in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or in divestments of nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom the failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations 

our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities or divest assets or an ongoing business we may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration we or the purchaser of a divested asset or business may not be able to complete a desired transaction for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing 

any acquisition that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies which may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing desired divestitures as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or continue to absorb the costs of lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestiture whether we are able to complete it or not may involve a number of risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with maintaining the business of the targeted divestiture during the disposition process and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring remaining portions of the operations of the business to other facilities 

gene therapy is a relatively new and stilldeveloping mode of treatment dependent on cuttingedge technologies and our customers’ gene therapies may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events negative public opinion continuing research or increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy and its financial cost may damage public perception of the safety utility or efficacy of gene therapies and harm our customers’ ability to conduct their business or obtain regulatory approvals for their gene therapy products and thereby have an indirect adverse effect on our gene therapy offerings 

gene therapy remains a relatively new means for treating disease and other medical conditions with only a few gene therapies approved to date in the us the eu or elsewhere public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community in addition ethical social legal and costbenefit concerns about gene therapy genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or limitations or even outright prohibitions on certain gene therapies or genetherapyrelated products various regulatory and legislative bodies have expressed an interest in or have taken steps towards further regulation of various biotechnologies including gene therapies more restrictive regulations or claims that certain gene therapies are unsafe or pose a hazard could reduce our customers’ use of our services we can provide no assurance whether legislative changes will be enacted regulations policies or guidance changed or interpretations of existing strictures by agencies or courts changed or what the impact of such changes if any may be 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa and the us occupational safety  health administration and equivalent local state national and transnational regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material included in our offerings and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded reserves we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us and such activities may result in unanticipated costs or management distraction 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we employ nearly 12300 individuals worldwide including approximately 6800 employees in north america 3900 in europe 900 in south america and 700 in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils or labor organizations are active at all of our european facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environments and laws our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities collective bargaining or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employmentrelated costs or may result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make to increase the funding level will reduce the cash available for our business or to discharge our financial obligations 

certain of our current and former employees in the us the uk germany france japan belgium switzerland and australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2019 the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was 774 million primarily related to our pension plans in the uk and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of 388 million as of june 30 2019 related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns applicable actuarial assumptions prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary 

such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness 

  risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business expose us to interestrate risk to the extent of our variablerate debt or prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness 

we are highly leveraged as of june 30 2019 we had 29593 million us dollar equivalent of total indebtedness outstanding consisting of 1283 million us dollar equivalent of secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 1365 million of senior unsecured indebtedness including 5000 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2027 the “usd 2027 notes” 4500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 the “usd 2026 notes” and together with the usd 2027 notes the “usd notes” €3800 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2024 the “euro notes” and together with the usd notes the “senior notes” 1439 million representing the fair value of the remaining deferred purchase consideration related to the acquisition of catalent indiana and 1673 million of capital lease and other obligations in addition we had 5434 million of unutilized capacity and 66 million of outstanding letters of credit under our 5500 million secured revolving credit facility which is part of our senior secured credit facilities the “revolving credit facility” 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest 

• exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because certain of our borrowings including the euro notes and certain borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are denominated in euros 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions could result in one or more events of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or capital investments or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

our total interest expense net was 1109 million 1114 million and 901 million for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloatingrate debt and assuming that our revolving credit facility is undrawn and libor is above any applicable minimum floor each change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in a change of approximately 95 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 

  

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial as of june 30 2019 we would have had approximately 5434 million available to us for borrowing subject to certain conditions under our revolving credit facility if new debt is added to our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels the risks associated with debt we currently face would increase 

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of operating company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply which operating company’s amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may 20 2014 as amended the “ credit agreement ” calls “ restricted subsidiaries ”  to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock 

• pay certain dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments 

• pay distributions from restricted subsidiaries 

• issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries 

• guarantee certain indebtedness 

• make certain investments 

• sell or exchange certain assets 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• create certain liens and 

• consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of crossdefault provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

despite the limitations in our debt agreements we retain the ability to take certain actions that may interfere with our ability timely to pay our substantial indebtedness 

the covenants in the credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain various exceptions to the limitations they otherwise impose on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to take the various actions described in the prior risk factor for example if the notes have investmentgrade ratings and we are not in default under these agreements certain of these covenants will not apply including the covenants restricting certain dividends and other payments the covenants concerning the incurrence of indebtedness and the covenants limiting guarantees of indebtedness by our restricted subsidiaries in addition the covenants restricting dividends and other distributions by us purchases or redemption of certain equity securities and prepayment redemption or repurchase of any subordinated indebtedness are subject to various exceptions 

we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness or changes in currency exchange rates and any such instrument may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into interestrate swap agreements currency swap agreements or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to adverse changes in variable interest rates and currency exchange rates such instruments may result in economic losses if for example prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixedrate commitment any such swap will expose us to creditrelated risks that if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

risks relating to our series a preferred stock 

the issuance of shares of our series a preferred stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock dilutes the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

on may 16 2019 we filed with the delaware secretary of state a certificate of designation of preferences rights and limitations the “certificate of designation” with respect to 1000000 shares of our preferred stock par value 001 per share designating such shares as our series a convertible preferred stock the “series a preferred stock” and on may 17 2019 we completed the sale of 650000 shares of our series a preferred stock to affiliates the “preferred stock investors” of leonard green  partners lp pursuant to an equity commitment and investment agreement dated as of april 14 2019 between us and certain of the preferred stock investors the “investment agreement” as of august 22 2019 these shares represented approximately 83 of our outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis holders of series a preferred 

stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 50 per annum subject to adjustment and payable quarterly in arrears see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements the dividends are to be paid in cash or inkind through an increase in the stated value of each share of series a preferred stock such holders are also entitled to receive on an asconverted basis whatever holders of each share of common stock may be entitled to receive as a result of any declaration of a dividend on the common stock 

as holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to vote on an asconverted basis together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock the issuance of the series a preferred stock to the preferred stock investors and any subsequent increase in the stated value of those shares by a paymentinkind of the dividends payable thereon effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock 

under various circumstances defined in the certificate of designation a holders of shares of our series a preferred stock may be entitled to convert such shares to shares of our common stock b we may require all holders of such shares to convert such shares to shares of our common stock or c we may redeem all such shares for at our election cash or shares of our common stock any conversion of shares of the series a preferred stock to shares of our common stock or redemption of shares of series a preferred stock for shares of our common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock and any sale in the public market of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion or redemption of the series a preferred stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we granted the preferred stock investors customary registration rights in respect of their shares of series a preferred stock and any share of our common stock issued upon any conversion or redemption of the series a preferred stock these registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading sales by the preferred stock investors of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

the preferred stock investors may exercise significant influence over us including through their ability to designate and the ability of the holders of series a preferred stock to elect a member of our board of directors 

as of august 22 2019 the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock represented approximately 83 of our outstanding common stock on an asconverted basis in addition the terms of the series a preferred stock grant the preferred stock investors consent rights with respect to certain actions by us including 

• amending our organizational documents in a manner that would have an adverse effect on the series a preferred stock 

• issuing securities that are senior to or equal in priority with the series a preferred stock and 

• incurrence of indebtedness to the extent such incurrence would cause our total leverage ratio for any applicable test period to exceed 600100 determined on a proforma basis as such terms are defined in our credit agreement 

as a result the preferred stock investors have the ability to influence the outcome of certain matters affecting our governance and capitalization the sponsors of the preferred stock investors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business and they may have interests that diverge from or even conflict with those of our other shareholders they may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

in addition the terms of that certain stockholders’ agreement we entered into with the preferred stock investors the “stockholders’ agreement” and of the certificate of designation grant the preferred stock investors certain rights to designate a director to serve on our board of directors which director is elected by a separate class vote of the holders of shares of the series a preferred stock for so long as the preferred stock investors beneficially own shares of series a preferred stock or shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock that have an aggregate value of 2500 million the preferred stock investors have the right to designate one director for election to our board of directors in addition for so long as the preferred stock investors beneficially own shares of series a preferred stock or shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of series a preferred stock that have an aggregate value of 5000 million the preferred stock investors have the right to designate one observer to our board of directors 

the director designated by the preferred stock investors is entitled to serve on committees of our board of directors subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law the interests of the director designated by the preferred stock investors may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors 

our series a preferred stock has rights preferences and privileges that are not held by and are preferential to the rights of holders of our common stock which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and may result in the interests of the preferred stock investors differing from holders of our common stock 

as holders of series a preferred stock the preferred stock investors have the right under the certificate of designation to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock an amount equal to the greater of a the stated value of their preferred shares plus all accrued and unpaid dividends or b the amount that such holders would have been entitled to receive upon our liquidation dissolution and winding up if all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock had been converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to such liquidation dissolution or winding up 

in addition regular dividends on the series a preferred stock accrue and are cumulative at the rate of 50 per annum subject to adjustment and payable quarterly in arrears the dividend on each share of series a preferred stock is to be paid in cash or inkind through an increase in the stated value of such share 

we are also required to redeem all shares of series a preferred stock upon certain change of control events at a value per share equal to the greater of a the sum of 1 the product of a the applicable mandatory redemption multiplier as defined in the certificate of designation multiplied by b the stated value of each such share plus 2 all accrued but unpaid dividends on such share and b the consideration holders would have received if they had converted their shares of series a preferred stock into shares of common stock immediately prior to the change of control event 

these dividend and share redemption obligations could adversely affect our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital capital expenditures growth opportunities acquisitions and other general corporate purposes our obligations to the holders of series a preferred stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition the preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the preferred stock investors and holders of shares of our common stock 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may change significantly and a holder of shares of our common stock may not be able to resell such shares at or above the price such stockholder paid or at all and could lose all or part of such investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile since shares of our common stock were offered for sale in our initial public offering on july 31 2014 through june 30 2019 our common stock price as quoted on the nyse ranged from 1892 to 5491 the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed above in “ risks relating to our business and our industry ” and the following 

• results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts or investors 

• results of operations that vary from those of our competitors 

• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts or investors 

• declines in the market prices of stocks generally or those of pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies 

• strategic actions by us or our competitors 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts new products acquisitions joint marketing relationships joint ventures other strategic relationships or capital commitments 

• changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets 

• changes in business or regulatory conditions or regulatory actions taken with respect to our business or the business of any of our competitors or customers 

• future sales of our common stock or other securities 

• investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives 

• the public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties including our filings with or information furnished to the sec 

• announcements relating to or developments in litigation 

• guidance if any that we provide to the public any change in this guidance or any failure to meet this guidance 

• the availability of an active trading market for our common stock 

• changes in the accounting principles we use to record our or our application of these principles to our business and 

• other events or factors including those resulting from natural disasters hostilities acts of terrorism geopolitical activity or responses to these events 

broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on the individual actions of our stockholders 

following periods of market volatility stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses if we become involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future a stockholder may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless it is sold for a net price greater than that which was paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future our board of directors has also authorized a stock buyback program that we may use from time to time to purchase shares of our common stock any future decision to pay a dividend in respect of our common stock and the amount and timing of any such dividend will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend such factors as they may deem relevant including general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future alternative deployments of our cash our future capital requirements and contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our holders of shares of our common stock or by our subsidiaries to us in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result a holder of a share of our common stock may not receive any return on such investment unless it is sold for a price greater than that which was paid for it taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock has been affected in part by the research and reports that industry and financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts furthermore if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or our industry change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors or other healthcare sector companies or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

future sales or the perception of future sales of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

as of august 22 2019  13926458 shares of our common stock including a the 13213408 shares of common stock into which outstanding shares of series a preferred stock can be converted at any time after may 17 2020 the “asconverted shares” and b 699503 shares of restricted stock and performancebased restricted stock issued pursuant to the equity incentive plans we have established for our employees and nonemployee directors representing approximately 87 of the sum of our total outstanding shares of common stock and the asconverted shares are “restricted securities” within the meaning of the sec’s rule 144 under the securities act “rule 144” and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 we are obliged to use our reasonable best efforts to prepare file and obtain the effectiveness of a registration statement in respect of the offer and sale of the shares of series a preferred stock and asconverted shares by the holders of the series a preferred stock by september 14 2019 

in addition as of august 22 2019 2537207 shares of our common stock may become eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options a total of 15600000 shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our 2018 omnibus incentive plan subject to adjustment for retired and postjune 30 2018 awards under the prior 2014 omnibus incentive plan as of august 22 2019 11159256 shares of our common stock remain available for future issuance under the 2018 omnibus incentive plan these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our equity securities that we wish to issue in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued or issuable in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the nyse or to restrictions set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness the certificate of designation and the stockholders’ agreement any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments acquisitions or otherwise may result in dilution to the holders of shares of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• until the provision completely sunsets at our annual meeting in respect of fiscal 2021 a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

• advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings though our board of directors has implemented shareholder proxy access 

• certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings 

• the removal of directors serving multiyear terms only for cause and 

• any amendment of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation only by the affirmative vote of at least 6623 of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 

provisions such as those just described to the extent that they remain in effect could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares

critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply development services and clinical supply services on july 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  codified as accounting standards codification  “ asc ”  606  using the modified retrospective method of adoption prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies for discussion on the impact of adopting asc 606 on our accounting refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment for our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements due to the regulated nature of our business these contract terms are highly interdependent and therefore are considered to be a single combined performance obligation for our development services and clinical supply services revenue our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations if a contract contains a single performance obligation we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation if a contract contains multiple performance obligations we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the “relative standalone selling price” as defined under asc 606 generally we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration if observable standalone selling prices are not available we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement determining the measure of progress that consistently depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment 

licensing revenue 

we occasionally enter into arrangements with customers that include licensing of functional intellectual property including drug formulae or other intangible property “outlicensing” we do not have any material license arrangement that contains more than one performance obligation our outlicensing generally entitles us to nonrefundable upfront fees or royalties nonrefundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when the licensed property is made available for the customer’s use and benefit provided there is no unsatisfied performance obligation included in the arrangement royalty payments from such arrangements are recognized when subsequent sale or usage of an item subject to the royalty occurs and the performance obligation to which royalty relates is satisfied 

longlived and other definitelived intangible assets 

we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill i ntangible assets primarily include customer relationships and trademarks valuing the identifiable intangible assets requires judgment we applied a discounted cash flow model in measuring the customer relationships in relation to the paragon acquisition which included certain assumptions such as revenue growth forecasted revenue and related margin and customer contract attrition and renewal rates intangibles assets are generally amortized on a straightline basis reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

• significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 

• significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business 

• significant negative industry or economic trends and 

• recognition of goodwill impairment charges 

if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles andor longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis to be generated from such assets if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable we measure any impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets see notes 5 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with asc 350  intangible and other assets  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed the evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response or if no qualitative assessment is performed a quantitative assessment based upon discounted cash flows is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions in fiscal 2017 and 2018 we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment but in fiscal 2019 we began with the qualitative assessment which was sufficient to find no impairment the 2018 and 2017 evaluations also resulted in no impairment charge

series a preferred stock dividend adjustment feature 

the terms of the series a preferred stock include a dividend adjustment feature to provide the holder with certain protections against a decline in the trading price of our common stock because this adjustment feature depends in part on the value of external metrics at future dates over which we have no control this feature is accounted for separately from the series a preferred stock the derivative instrument is measured at fair value as of the valuation date using a combination of i a monte carlo simulation and ii a binomial lattice model which incorporates the terms and conditions of the series a preferred stock and is based on changes in the market prices of shares of our common stock over successive periods key assumptions used in both models include the current market price of one share of the common stock and its historical and expected volatility riskneutral interest rates and the remaining term of the adjustment feature these assumptions require significant management judgment and are considered level 3 inputs we recognize the derivative as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and revalue it as of the end of each quarterly reporting period changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

income taxes 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in fiscal 2018 we recorded a provision for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 tax act but we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2019  

the 2017 tax act imposed taxes with respect to socalled “global intangible lowtaxed income” “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a us company in accordance with asc 740 we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred 

we had valuation allowances of 763 million and 862 million as of june 30 2019 and 2018 respectively against our deferred tax assets we considered all available evidence both positive and negative in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

• carrybacks of existing net operating losses if permitted by tax law 

• future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 

• tax planning strategies and 

• future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 

we considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law during the year ended june 30 2019 we released 121 million of the valuation allowance related to certain us combined states of the 121 million released 05 million relates to state net operating loss “nols” carryforwards which expire over a number of years beginning in 2028 and 116 million relates to other state deferred tax temporary differences that will reduce income for state tax purposes in the future 

while the valuation allowance related to certain us combined states was partially released in the year ended june 30 2019 a state valuation allowance of 351 million is maintained on state nols and deductible temporary differences for the separate and remaining combined states the remaining state valuation allowance is due to our history of tax losses and anticipated loss utilization rates in separate filing status states as well as the difference in the rules related to allocated and apportioned income for separate filing status states versus combined filing status states 

unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution at june 30 2019 and 2018 we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 52 million and 41 million respectively we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during fiscal 2019  

our accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the us and in each of the nonus jurisdictions in which we operate the determination of income subject to taxation in each tax paying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate in addition the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction for those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates we apply transfer pricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions additionally for taxes incurred outside the us we are entitled under the internal revenue code as amended by the 2017 tax act and regulations promulgated thereunder to claim us foreign tax credits to offset certain tax liabilities arising in the us certain of the assumptions and allocations used in the determination of the key inputs underlying the foreign tax credits particularly as they relate to the calculation of us income taxes owed on gilti are based on recently issued regulatory guidance that does not necessarily address all elements needed to prepare the calculations and is therefore subject to considerable judgment  

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our annual financial reporting periods end on june 30 our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental europe and the uk the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms in fiscal 2018 we acquired catalent indiana in order to enhance our biologics capabilities and it has been integrated into our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment in fiscal 2019 we completed the acquisitions of juniper based in the uk in august 2018 and paragon based in the us in may 2019 which have been integrated into our oral drug delivery and biologics and specialty drug delivery segments respectively 

foreign exchange rates 

our operating network is global and as a result we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the currency in which we report our financial results and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2019 approximately 48 of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the united states significant foreign currencies for our operations include the british pound the euro the brazilian real the argentine peso the japanese yen the canadian dollar and the australian dollar 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry which has been estimated to generate 1 trillion in annual revenue including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in earlystage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals biologics and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

nongaap performance metrics 

as described in this section management uses various financial metrics including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in us gaap to measure and assess the performance of our business and to make critical business decisions we therefore believe that presentation of certain of these nongaap metrics in this annual report will aid investors in understanding our business performance 

use of ebitda from operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense expensebenefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted for the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  “ ebitda from operations ”  ebitda from operations is not defined under us gaap is not a measure 

of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of noncash depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the consolidated financial statements and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the most directly comparable measure to ebitda from operations defined under us gaap is earningsloss from operations included in this managements discussion and analysis is a reconciliation of earningsloss from operations to ebitda from operations 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other incomeexpense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expensebenefit and depreciation and amortization  “ segment ebitda ”  

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

summary twoyear key financial performance metrics 

the below tables summarize our results in fiscal 2019 and 2018 on several financial metrics we use to measure performance refer to the discussions below regarding performance and the use of key financial metrics and “—n ongaap performance metrics ” concerning the measurement of revenue at “ constant currency ” 

fiscal year ended june 30 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 

results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 were as follows 



 percentage not meaningful 

net revenue 

net revenue increased by 1116 million or 5 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to acquisitions we acquired paragon in may 2019 juniper in august 2018 and catalent indiana in october 2017 which increased revenue by 7 but the increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue from comparator sourcing arrangements within our clinical supply services segment of 4 as a result of the adoption of asc 606 we recorded comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus a gross basis resulting in a decrease in net revenue with no corresponding decrease to ebitda excluding the impact of acquisitions divestitures and the change in accounting for comparator sourcing arrangements revenue increased 2 primarily driven by increased net revenue within our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment 

gross margin 

gross margin increased by 684 million or 9 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions discussed above on a constant currency basis gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 319 in the twelve months ended june 30 2019 an increase from the prior year of 133 basis points primarily as a result of the adoption of asc 606 pursuant to which we record comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus the former gross basis which increased gross margin percentage by 127 basis points 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 523 million or 11 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily driven by acquisitionrelated expenses during the year including transaction fees of 197 million related to the acquisitions of paragon juniper and the two advanced biologics clinical development and manufacturing sites in southern maryland from novavax inc and the expected acquisition of the oral solids biologics and sterile product manufacturing and packaging facility in anagni italy additionally there were incremental selling general and additional administrative expenses from the acquired companies of 284 million primarily driven by 199 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense and 30 million of employeerelated costs selling general and administrative expenses further increased approximately 44 million for noncash equitybased compensation driven by the achievement of certain performancebased metrics during the fiscal year 

impairment charges and loss on sale of assets 

impairment charges for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 and june 30 2018 were 51 million and 87 million respectively impairment charges in the current year were driven by a software related intangible asset in our clinical supply services segment that was not implemented and whose value therefore was not fully recoverable the prior year included losses on the sales of two asiapacific manufacturing sites in the softgel technologies segment the site divestitures were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the segment or our business as a whole 

restructuring and other 

restructuring and other charges of 141 million in fiscal 2019 increased by 43 million excluding the impact of foreign exchange compared to the amounts in fiscal 2018 and were driven by increases in employeerelated actions restructuring expenses varies periodtoperiod based on site consolidation efforts and other efforts to further streamline the business 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 1109 million in fiscal 2019 was in line with interest expense incurred during fiscal 2018 the interest expense during fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by outstanding debt associated with the financing of the catalent indiana acquisition in october 2017 the financing of the paragon acquisition in may 2019 and the offering of the usd 2027 notes in june 2019 the principal balance of our debt obligation increased during the fiscal year however our interest expense remained in line with the prior fiscal year since we were able to reduce the higher interest rates applicable to certain of our debt and pay down some of our debt with the net proceeds of a july 2018 public offering of our common stock the “2018 equity offering” 

for additional information concerning our debt and financing arrangements including the changing mix of debt and equity in our capital structure see “—liquidity and capital resources—debt and financing arrangements” and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  

a component of the purchase price for the catalent indiana acquisition consisted of 2000 million in deferred purchase consideration payable in four annual 500 million installments the first of which was paid in october 2018 the present value of the unpaid portion of the deferred consideration is accounted for as debt with the difference between the nominal value of such portion and such present value considered imputed interest expense 

other expense net   

other expense net of 27 million for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by financing charges of 158 million related to the offering of the usd 2027 notes and was partially offset by a gain of 129 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the series a preferred stock and 05 million of unrealized foreign currency gains in the year see notes 9 and 13 to the consolidated financial statement for more details on the series a preferred stock dividend adjustment 

other expense net for fiscal 2018 of 55 million was primarily driven by financing charges of 118 million related to the offering of the usd 2026 notes and an amendment to the credit agreement which included a 61 million charge for commitment fees paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by 46 million of foreign currency gains in the fiscal year 

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 was 229 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of 1603 million our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2018 was 684 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of 1520 million the income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the impact of the 2017 tax act changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items including equity compensation generally fluctuations in our effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items including the reversal portion of the state valuation allowance which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item 

segment review 

the below charts depict the percentage of revenue from each of our four reporting segments for the previous two years refer below for discussions regarding the segments ’ revenue and ebitda performance and to “ nongaap performance metrics ”  

our results on a segment basis for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 were as follows

softgel technologies segment 



softgel technologies’ net revenue decreased 103 million or 1 excluding the impact of foreign exchange as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 net revenue remained consistent to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 excluding the impact of divestitures volume increases across our consumer health portfolio within europe were offset by strong price competition across the generic portion of our prescription product business in north america revenue in our consumer health business also decreased by 1 across north america and latin america resulting from a shortage in our ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient supply during the first 9 months of 2019 which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter 

softgel technologies’ segment ebitda increased by 21 million or 1 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange excluding the reduction of licensing revenue profit of 2 segment ebitda without divestitures increased 3 the increase was primarily related to increased volume in the consumer health portfolio across europe offset by a shortage in our supply of ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient during the first 9 months of 2019 which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter which reduced segment ebitda by 3 

in december 2017 we divested two manufacturing sites in asiapacific in the softgel technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations the site divestitures resulted in a decrease to net revenue of 1 with no impact to segment ebitda in the twelve months ended june 30 2019 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 

biologics and specialty drug delivery segment 



net revenue in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment increased by 1467 million or 24 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange net revenue without acquisitions increased by 7 driven primarily by increased endmarket demand for our drug product offerings offset slightly by decreased volume demand related to our us drug substance product offering due to the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for noncell line clinical manufacturing services 

biologics and specialty drug delivery segment ebitda increased by 350 million or 24 excluding the impact of foreign exchange segment ebitda without acquisitions was in line with prior year primarily due to strong us drug product and drugsubstance endmarket demand offset by the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for noncell line clinical manufacturing services in our us drug substance platform as well as unfavorable product mix in our european specialty drug product platform 

on october 23 2017 we acquired catalent indiana which increased net revenue and segment ebitda on an inorganic basis in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment by 12 and 17 respectively in the twelve months ended june 30 2019 compared to the corresponding prioryear period 

on may 17 2019 we acquired paragon which increased net revenue and segment ebitda on an inorganic basis in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment by 5 and 7 respectively in the twelve months ended june 30 2019 compared to the corresponding prioryear period 

oral drug delivery segment 



net revenue in our oral drug delivery segment increased by 677 million or 10 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily resulting from our juniper acquisition revenue without acquisitions decreased 1 primarily driven by decreased endmarket demand for a key product within our usbased commercial oral delivery solutions platform partially offset by an increase related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our usbased oral delivery solutions platform and a favorable impact from licensing revenue recorded during the third quarter the favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction which consisted of a grant to a third party of the company’s right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a onetime upfront license fee 

oral drug delivery’s segment ebitda increased by 23 million or 10 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange segment ebitda without acquisitions decreased 5 primarily driven by decreased endmarket demand for a key product within our usbased commercial oral delivery solutions platform partially offset by an increase in volume related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our usbased oral delivery solutions platform and a 

favorable impact from licensing profit recorded during the third quarter the favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction which consisted of a grant to a third party of the company’s right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a onetime upfront license fee 

on august 14 2018 we acquired juniper which increased inorganic net revenue and segment ebitda in our oral drug delivery segment for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 by 11 and 15 respectively compared to the prioryear period 

clinical supply services segment 



clinical supply services’ net revenue decreased by 1027 million or 24 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 excluding the impact of foreign exchange as a result of the adoption of asc 606 the company recorded comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus a gross basis resulting in a decrease to net revenue of 25 partially offset by an increase in revenue primarily due to higher comparator sourcing volume and profitability as well as storage and distribution and manufacturing and packaging business volume  

clinical supply services’ segment ebitda increased by 109 million or 14 excluding the impact of foreign exchange as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2018 primarily due to a favorable shift within the storage and distribution business increased growth in project management revenue and improved capacity utilization across the network based on prior strategic investments

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and use of cash 

our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations and the net proceeds of financing activities the principal uses of cash are to fund operating and capital expenditures business or asset acquisitions interest payments on debt the payment of deferred purchase consideration from the catalent indiana acquisition the payment of the quarterly dividend on the series a preferred stock and any mandatory or discretionary principal payment on our debt at the current stated value of the series a preferred stock outstanding as of june 30 2019 the aggregate amount of each regular quarterly dividend if paid in cash is 8125 million because the shares of series a preferred stock were first issued on may 17 2019 the aggregate amount of the first regular dividend payment for the period ended june 30 2019 which was paid in cash was 40 million as of june 30 2019 operating company had available a 5500 million revolving credit facility that matures in may 2024 following the execution of the fourth amendment the “ fourth amendment ” to operating company’s credit agreement in may 2019 the capacity of which is reduced by the amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior secured credit facilities and those shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline borrowings at june 30 2019 we had 66 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

we believe that our cash on hand cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months including with respect to payment of our quarterly regular dividend on the series a preferred stock if paid in cash and the amounts expected to become due with respect to our pending capital projects we have no significant maturity under any of our bank or note debt until the eurodenominated term loans in our senior secured credit facility mature in may 2024 we have three remaining annual payments of 

500 million each with respect to the previously described deferred purchase consideration the first of which is due in october 2019

operating activities 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 cash provided by operating activities was 2477 million a decrease of 1268 million compared to 3745 million for the comparable prioryear period the decrease was due to a higher collection of receivables during the corresponding prioryear period and higher inventory levels during fiscal 2019 compared to the prioryear period also we had a higher accounts receivable balance at the end of the currentyear period as a result of higher days sales outstanding during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 the increase in day sales outstanding is primarily driven by the adoption of asc 606 upon adoption of asc 606 the time for recognizing revenue for commercial product supply arrangements changed from delivery to when control is transferred to the customer which occurs over time as units of product successfully complete the contractually required quality assurance process however we continued to invoice upon shipment of the product which generally added one to two weeks to our days sales outstanding in addition certain customers adopted digital payment processing systems which resulted in further delays in receiving payments and ultimately led to increased days sales outstanding

debt covenants 

senior secured credit facilities 

the credit agreement contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions operating company’s and operating company’s restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares create liens on assets engage in mergers and consolidations sell assets pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock repay subordinated indebtedness engage in certain transactions with affiliates make investments loans or advances make certain acquisitions enter into sale and leaseback transactions amend material agreements governing operating company’s subordinated indebtedness and change operating company’s lines of business 

the credit agreement also contains changeofcontrol provisions and certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default the revolving credit facility requires compliance with a net leverage covenant when there is a 30 or more draw outstanding at a period end as of june 30 2019 operating company was in compliance with all material covenants under the credit agreement 

subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement permits operating company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness none of operating company’s nonus subsidiaries or puerto rico subsidiaries is a guarantor of the loans 

  

under the credit agreement operating company’s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “consolidated ebitda” in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda is based on the definitions in the credit agreement is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

the euro notes and the usd notes 

the several indentures governing each of the euro notes the usd 2026 notes and the usd 2027 notes collectively the “ indentures ”  contain certain covenants that among other things limit the ability of operating company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee more debt or issue certain preferred shares pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments make certain investments sell certain assets create liens consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets enter into certain transactions with their affiliates and designate their subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries these covenants are subject to a number of exceptions limitations and qualifications as set forth in the indentures the indentures also contain customary events of default including but not limited to nonpayment breach of covenants and payment or acceleration defaults in certain other indebtedness of operating company or certain of its subsidiaries upon an event of default either the holders of at least 30 in principal amount of each of the thenoutstanding euro notes usd 2026 notes and the usd 2027 notes or the applicable trustee under the indentures may declare the applicable senior notes immediately due and payable or in certain circumstances the applicable senior notes will become automatically immediately due and payable as of june 30 2019 operating company was in compliance with all material covenants under the indentures 

liquidity in foreign subsidiaries 

as of june 30 2019 and june 30 2018 the amounts of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were 2039 million and 1247 million respectively out of the total consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 3454 million and 4102 million respectively these balances are dispersed across many international locations around the world 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share 

the below tables summarize our fiscal 2019 and 2018 results on several financial metrics we use to measure performance refer to the discussions below regarding performance and use of key financial metrics and to “ nongaap performance metrics ” 

adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement the ability of operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “ consolidated ebitda ” in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the measure under us gaap most directly comparable to ebitda from operations and adjusted ebitda is earningsloss from operations in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are 

included in the definitions of ebitda from operations and consolidated net income as required in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things 

• does not include noncash stockbased employee compensation expense and certain other noncash charges 

• does not include cash and noncash restructuring severance and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations 

• adds back noncontrolling interest expense which represents minority investors’ ownership of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries and is therefore not available to us and 

• includes estimated cost savings that have not yet been fully reflected in our results 

a reconciliation between net earnings and adjusted ebitda which also shows the adjustments from ebitda from operations follows 



1 represents the amount of income taxrelated expense recorded within our net earningsloss that may not result in cash payment or receipt 

2 foreign exchange loss of 05 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 includes a 54 million of unrealized losses related to foreign trade receivables and payables b 34 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the eurodenominated debt and c 179 million of unrealized losses on intercompany loans the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate gains from the settlement of intercompany loans of 215 million intercompany loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations 

foreign exchange gain of 50 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2018 includes a 29 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payables b 119 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the eurodenominated debt and c 107 million of unrealized losses on intercompany loans the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate gains from the settlement of intercompany loans of 247 million intercompany loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations 

3 represents primarily the 129 million gain recorded on the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability from issuance through june 30 2019 

4 in our earnings releases for the quarters ended september 30 2018 december 31 2018 and march 31 2019 we included an adjustment in the three months ended september 30 2018 relating to a cumulative effect of change in accounting for asc 606 we are no longer making this adjustment in our presentation of adjusted ebitda 

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share 

we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share which we sometimes refer to as “ adjusted eps ” as performance metrics adjusted net income is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations we believe that the presentations of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use this measure for business planning and executive compensation purposes we define adjusted net income as net earningsloss adjusted for 1 earnings or loss from discontinued operations net of tax 2 amortization attributable to purchase accounting and 3 income or loss from noncontrolling interest in majorityowned operations we also make adjustments for other cash and noncash items included in the table below partially offset by our estimate of the tax effects as a result of such cash and noncash items our definition of adjusted net income may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies adjusted net income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding 



1 represents the amortization attributable to purchase accounting for previously completed business combinations 

2 foreign exchange gain of 05 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2019 includes a 54 million of unrealized losses related to foreign trade receivables and payables b 34 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the eurodenominated debt and c 179 million of unrealized losses on intercompany loans the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate gains from the settlement of intercompany loans of 215 million intercompany loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations 

foreign exchange loss for the twelve months ended june 30 2018 includes a 29 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payables b 119 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the eurodenominated debt and c 107 million of unrealized gains on intercompany loans the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate losses from the settlement of intercompany loans of 18 million intercompany loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations 

3 we computed the tax effect of adjustments to adjusted net income by applying the statutory tax rate in the jurisdictions to the income or expense items that are adjusted in the period presented if a valuation allowance exists the rate applied is zero 

4 discrete period income tax expensebenefit items are unusual or infrequently occurring items primarily including changes in judgment related to the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years changes in measurement of a prior year tax position deferred tax impact of changes in tax law and purchase accounting 

5 during fiscal 2018 we recorded a net tax charge of 425 million as a provisional estimate of the net accounting impact of the 2017 tax act in fiscal 2019 we completed our analysis as permitted by staff accounting bulletin no 118 and recorded a reduction of 35 million 

6 in our earnings releases for the quarters ended september 30 2018 december 31 2018 and march 31 2019 we included an adjustment in the three months ended september 30 2018 relating to a cumulative effect of change in accounting for asc 606 we are no longer making this adjustment in our presentation of adjusted net income 

interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities historically we have used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2019 we did not have any interestrate swap agreement in place that would have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans 

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate on our investments in our foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2019 we had 7751 million of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

from time to time we may use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of june 30 2019 



1 estimated future payments with respect to our obligations and other liabilities denominated in a currency other than the us dollar were calculated using the currency exchange rates in effect as of june 30 2019 

2 represents gross maturities of our longterm debt obligations excluding capital lease obligations as of june 30 2019 

3 represents estimated interest payments relating to our longterm obligations including our capital lease obligations estimated future interest payments on our variablerate debt obligations were calculated using the interest rates in effect as of june 30 2019 

4 represents maturities of our capital lease obligations included within longterm debt as of june 30 2019 

5 represents minimum rental payments for operating leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms 

6 purchase obligations includes agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations disclosed above may include estimates of the period in which cash outflows will occur purchase orders entered into in the normal course of business and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table in addition contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period 

7 primarily relates to certain longterm employeerelated liabilities for operations under programs that we have discontinued 

the table excludes our retirement and other postemployment benefits  “ opeb ”  obligations the timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans in fiscal 2020 we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards beyond fiscal 2020 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are generally paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and principally depend on the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the table also excludes 226 million of funded deferred compensation payments owed as of june 30 2019 to certain employees participating in our deferred compensation plan the timing and amount of payments for these obligations depend on participantdirected distributions withdrawals and status as part of the deferred compensation plan we have a corresponding 219 million of deferred compensation investments as of june 30 2019 which will be used to fund future obligations to the participants 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases and outstanding letters of credit as discussed above we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangement as of june 30 2019 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

we have historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variablerate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2019 we did not have any interestrate swap agreement in place that would either have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans or would be considered effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchangerate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products throughout the world our foreigncurrency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreignexchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso brazilian real and australian dollar our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars our functional currency the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency except in argentina a hyperinflationary economy where our results are measured in us dollars adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss utilizing periodend exchange rates foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in other incomeexpense net such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope our large customer base the extensive range of products we produce our broad service offerings and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of a product ’ s lifecycle in fiscal 2018 we produced nearly 7000  distinct items across multiple categories our fiscal 2018 regulatorybased classification of revenues demonstrates this branded drugs 36 generic prescription drugs 10 biologics 26 overthecounter 13 and consumer health veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics 15 combined in fiscal 2018  our top 20 products represented approximately 21 of total revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of revenue and with no individual product greater than 4 we serve more than 1000  customers in approximately 80 countries with a majority of our fiscal 2018  revenues coming from outside the united states this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payerdriven pricing pressures experienced by our branded drug and biologic customers 

longstanding extensive relationships with blue chip customers 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2018  we did business with 90  of the top 100 branded drug marketers 21 of the top 25 generics marketers 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 23 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with more than 1000  other customers including emerging and specialty companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business 

  

models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs 

we believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers   

deep broad and growing technology foundation 

our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants our leading softgel platforms including liquigels optishell and vegicaps capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family and our optipact and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory ophthalmic and injectable routes including the blowfillseal unit dose technology and prefilled syringes we also provide advanced biologics formulation options including gene product expression gpex cellline and smartag antibodydrug conjugate technologies we have a market leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and nebulized and intranasal forms we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last five years as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications including the fiscal 2016 launch of our optiform solution suite a dose formagnostic bioavailability enhancement program for earlystage molecules and the recent acquisition of catalent indiana which expands our biologics platform our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies our scientists and engineers and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network our global product development team drives a focused application of resources to our highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development as of june 30 2018  we had over 1000  product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers molecules to yield final dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years see contractual arrangements for more detail approximately twothirds of our fiscal 2018  advanced delivery technology platform revenues comprised of our softgel technologies biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage 

significant recent growth investments 

we have made significant investments over time to establish a global manufacturing network and today employ 59 million  square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space across five continents we have deployed approximately 719 million in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive ongoing and continuous improvements in safety productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other applicable requirements following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have more than 1300  employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance all of our facilities are registered with the fda or  other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency the ema in some cases facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies in fiscal 2018  we were subject to 62 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed approximately 250 regulatory audits  we also undergo more than 400 customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a favorable competitive differentiator 

  

strong and experienced management team 

our executive leadership team collectively has more than 200 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of more than 20 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships 

our strategy 

we are pursuing the following key growth initiatives 

follow the molecule ®  providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for early preclinical development of small molecules biologics and antibodydrug conjugates to formulation and analytical services through clinical development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for therapeutic trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing expertise that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in appropriate dosage forms the relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life including with additional customers through potential generic launches or overthecounter conversion for prescription products we are typically the sole andor exclusive provider and are reflected in customers’ new drug applications our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of an innovator drugs market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply both branded and generic customers 

an example of this can be found in a leading overthecounter respiratory brand which today uses both our zydis fast dissolve and our liquigels softgel technologies we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription zydis product for six years and we have continued to provide the zydis form since the switch to overthecounter status in the united states and other markets in the early 2000s subsequently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 26year long relationship across multiple formats and markets 

customer product pipeline  continuing to grow through new projects and product launches 

we intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized advanced delivery technology products with new development programs as of june 30 2018  our product development teams were working on over 1000  new customer programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our expanded capabilities and technologies although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical biological and consumer and animal health products we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in the year ended june 30 2018  we introduced 207 new products up 13 from the prior year 

catalent continues to be the global leader in providing chemistry manufacturing and controlsbased product development services to the global pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health industry driven by thousands of projects annually in the year ended june 30 2018  we recognized approximately 513 million of revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers included in our softgel technologies biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery reporting segments up 25 from the prior year in addition substantially all of the revenues associated with the clinical supply services segment relate to our support of customer products in development 

capabilities  capacity  expanding in biologics and other attractive markets 

recognizing the strategic importance of biologics we began to build a differentiated biologics cellline and formulation development platform in 2002 since then we have invested over 1 billion in our biologics business including capital investments plus the fiscal 2018 acquisition of catalent indiana for an aggregate nominal purchase price of 950 million included in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment today we are a recognized leader in biologics including advanced cellline development formulation and fillfinish into prefilled syringes vials and cartridges and increasingly in 

  

specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substance for use in clinical trials and bioanalytical analysis the third production suite in our madison wisconsin facility came online in fiscal 2018 taking us to commercial scale supply for biologics drug substance we have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for more than 600 products many using our advanced gpex technology we have invested in a secondgeneration antibodydrug conjugate technology smartag and we see continued progress in our customers’ smartag productdevelopment activities 

in addition to biologics we have increased our existing investments in several facilities in order to expand in attractive markets including a recently completed significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in kentucky and the scalingup of commercial manufacturing capacity for metereddose inhalers we have also inorganically added key new capabilities in early development via our fiscal 2017 acquisition of pharmatek and our acquisition of juniper pharmaceuticals after the close of fiscal 2018 and expanded our north american consumer health softgel capacity via our fiscal 2017 accucaps acquisition 

advanced technologies  capitalize on our substantial platforms 

we have broad and diverse technology platform that are supported by extensive knowhow and approximately 1200  patents and patent applications in approximately 100 families across advanced delivery technologies drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation knowhow databases of formulated products and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result nearly 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us  

in addition to resolving product challenges for our customers’ molecules for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proofofconcept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for selfcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

operational leverage  deploy existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our lean manufacturing and lean six sigma programs a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability we intend to continue to apply this discipline to leverage further our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2009 we have expanded gross margin by over 300 basis points  and adjusted ebitda margin by over 200 basis points  note that adjusted ebitda is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and that further explanations of this metric and comparisons to the most nearly comparable us gaap metrics are set forth below at management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—historical and adjusted ebitda 

strategic acquisitions and licensing  build on our existing platform 

we operate in highly fragmented markets in both our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions businesses within those markets the five top players represent nearly 35 and 10 of the total market share respectively by revenue our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets and to generate operating leverage through such acquisitions since fiscal 2012 we have executed nine transactions investing approximately 14 billion and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

while we are rigorously focused on driving catalents organic growth we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolton strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments we have a dedicated corporate development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions 

  

our reportable segments 

in fiscal 2018 we engaged in a business reorganization to better align our internal business unit structure with our follow the molecule strategy and the increased focus on our biologicsrelated offerings under the revised structure the businesses comprising out softgel technologies and clinical supply services reporting segments have not changed but we created two new operating segments from our former drug delivery solutions segment 

 

 

each of the two new segments reports through a separate management team our operating segments are the same as our reporting segments all priorperiod comparative segment information has been restated to reflect the current reportable segments in accordance with asc 280 segment reporting as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k the consolidated financial statements our offerings and services are summarized below by reporting segment

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to produce their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of these customers 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses and quality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the 

  

offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice minimum volume commitments royalties profitsharing and fixed fees we employ a range of capacity access approaches from standard to completely dedicated capacity models based on customer and product needs we generally secure pricing and other contract mechanisms in our supply agreements to allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements permit us to renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials we use to make products our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions the terms of our manufacturing supply agreements range from three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our softgel biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our clinical supply services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2018  our backlog was 11123 million  compared to 10522 million  as of june 30 2017  including 2732 million  and 3383 million  respectively related to our clinical supply services segment we expect to recognize approximately 84 of revenue from the backlog in existence as of june 30 2018  by the completion of the fiscal year ending june 30 2019  

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world we have thirtyfour  facilities four locations each operate as two facilities each because they operate for the benefit of two different reporting segments on five continents with 59 million  square feet of manufacturing laboratory and related space our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

  

we operate our plants in accordance with cgmp or other applicable requirements all of our facilities are registered with the fda or  other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases our facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested 4559 million  of cash outflows in our manufacturing facilities since fiscal 2016  through improvements and expansions in our facilities including 1765 million  on capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 we believe that our facilities and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2018 we achieved approximately 98 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including lean six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for our softgel technologies segment packaging films for our clinical supply services segment and resin for our blowfillseal business in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by 

  

pandemics or geopolitical and other issues for example commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers any future restriction that were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval periods 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see risk factors—risks relating to our business and industry— our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials   

competition 

we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies clinical trials support outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally 

  

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed while we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable company 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements costs incurred in connection with the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses such research and development costs included in selling general and administrative expenses amounted to 63 million  70 million  and 76 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  june 30 2017  and june 30 2016  respectively costs incurred in connection with research and development services we provide to customers and services performed in support of the commercial manufacturing process for customers are recorded within cost of sales such research and development costs included in cost of sales amounted to 462 million  458 million  and 474 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018  june 30 2017  and june 30 2016  respectively 

employees 

as of june 30 2018  we had approximately 10700 employees in thirtyfour facilities on five continents thirteen  facilities are in the united states with certain employees at one facility being represented by a labor organization with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all eleven  of our european facilities consistent with labor environmentslaws in european countries similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist at our plants in argentina australia brazil and canada our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings services and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations certain of our operations and products are under intellectual property licenses from third parties and in certain instances we license our technology to third parties we also have a long track record of innovation across our lines of business and to further encourage active innovation we have developed incentive compensation systems linked to patent filings and other recognition and reward programs for scientists and nonscientists alike 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered and issued and also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks we hold approximately 1200  patents and patent applications worldwide relating to advanced drug delivery and biologics formulations and technologies as well as manufacturing and other areas relevant to our business 

we hold patents and license rights relating to certain aspects of our formulations nutritional and pharmaceutical dosage forms mammalian cell engineering and sterile manufacturing services we also hold patents relating to certain processes and products we have a number of pending patent applications in the united states and certain foreign countries and intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate we have enforced and will continue to enforce our intellectual property rights in the united states and worldwide 

we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business

risk factors 

tableend if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate including competing with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing clinical trials support services or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally 

we face substantial competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value responsiveness and speed some competitors may have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customers requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon among other things available resources and their need to develop new products which in turn is dependent upon a number of factors including their competitors’ research development and production initiatives and the anticipated market uptake clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas in addition consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations including research and development departments and their budgets our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers we have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the 

  

amount of available policy limits require larger selfinsured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 25 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability or other claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we and our customers are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs similar bodies of the eu and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world and in the future any change to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us among other rules affecting us we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cgmp and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits or licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the fda the dea the dhhs foreign agencies including the ema and other various state boards of pharmacy state health departments or comparable state and foreign agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our offerings are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal foreign and transnational regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals permits or registrations including those relating to products or facilities in addition any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant customers may also claim loss of profits due to lost or delayed sales although our contracts generally place substantial limits on such claims there can be no assurance that any such contractual limitation will be applicable sufficient or fully enforced in any given situation 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical or medical device must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal and foreign regulatory authorities we or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new products for any number of reasons 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us or our customers with applicable law or regulation or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore loss of a permit license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions or costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design formulation development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the products we supply quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations or civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such an issue could subject us to costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses the cost of which could be significant 

  

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our softgel technologies biologics and specialty drug delivery and oral drug delivery segments due in part to strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses time and expense spent investigating the cause lost production time and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation 

our global operations are subject to economic political and regulatory risks including the risks of changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards that could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures   

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global and regional economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition including potential competition from manufacturers in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain and customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such mitigating measures may be unavailable or costly or may not succeed 

the exit of the uk from the european union could have future adverse effects on our operations revenues and costs and therefore our profitability 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved the uk’s exit from the eu and the uk government has invoked its right to withdraw effective in march 2019 there is no immediate change in either the uk or the eu as a result of either action but the uk government is now engaged in both internal and external discussions with affected parties and legislation regarding the changes that will result from the decision to exit four of our thirtyfour  facilities employing hundreds of workers are located in the uk and these facilities as well as others in our network source goods manufacture goods and provide services from or intended for the uk these facilities operate within an existing framework of trade and human capital integration with the eu and by extension the other parts of the world with which the eu has trade and immigration agreements furthermore some of our facilities located in other eu member states ship materials to or otherwise engage in various business interactions with the uk including our uk facilities due to future changes in the uk resulting from an eventual exit including potentially increased trade barriers increased tariff rates or custom duties or in anticipation of such changes our suppliers customers or employees may change their interactions with us including changes in imports to or exports from the uk changes in the requested utilization of our facilities both within and without the uk and changes in our relationships with our workforce in the uk to the extent that our facilities operate as part of a crossborder supply and distribution chain their operations may also be negatively affected by a decrease in the crossborder mobility of goods and services we cannot anticipate the nature of these changes as they largely depend on factors outside our control but the changes may result in adverse changes in our future operations revenues and costs and therefore our future profitability 

if we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our 

  

offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies to the extent that our proprietary rights are based on patents patents are inherently of limited longevity and therefore will ultimately expire and such offerings may then become subject to competition without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations 

the success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur and this may force us to compete with third parties thereby affecting our revenue and profitability we do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any patent currently protecting our business 

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of any such legal action may be unfavorable to us 

any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some foreign countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

  

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered or issued and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks in the past third parties have occasionally opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the united states or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

license agreements with third parties control our rights to use certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies owned by third parties some of which are important to our business termination of these license agreements for any reason could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property causing an adverse change in our operations or the inability to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the united states for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents if the patents on which our customers rely were successfully challenged and as a result the affected products become subject to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings this includes but is not limited to gelatin starch iota carrageenan petroleumbased products and resin also our customers frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product it is possible that any of our or our customers supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements import or export restrictions natural disasters international supply disruptions caused by pandemics geopolitical issues operational or quality issues at the suppliers facilities and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin is a critical component in most of the products produced in our softgel technologies segment gelatin is available from only a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from bse or otherwise any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for or public sentiment towards our customers’ products in the united states or internationally or other changes in applicable policies regarding the healthcare industry including possible changes to the affordable care act the aca in the united states could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by affecting demand for our offerings 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our offerings in particular there is significant uncertainty about the likelihood of changes to the aca and healthcare laws in general in the united states including future legislation that may affect or put a cap on future pricing of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products while we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the aca any substantial revision of this or other healthcare legislation could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers’ products which in turn could have a negative impact on our results of 

  

operations financial condition or business changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices or in public or government sentiment for the industry as a whole could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

as a global enterprise fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar our reporting currency against foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations  

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including our eurodenominated 475 senior notes due 2024 and a portion of our senior secured credit facilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar which is the currency that we use to report our financial results as a result changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currency to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates affecting the various currencies in which we do business including as a result of the uks referendum to exit from the eu such volatility and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

the impact to our business of us tax legislation enacted in december 2017 could differ materially from our current estimates 

in december 2017 the us government enacted wideranging tax legislation the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act significantly revised us tax law by among other provisions a lowering the applicable us federal statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 b creating a partial territorial tax system that includes imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings c creating provisions regarding the 1 income deemed to be global intangible low tax income gilti 2 the foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction and 3 the base erosion antiabuse tax beat and d eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions such as deductions for interest expense executive compensation expense and certain employee expenses 

although we are still determining all the effects of the 2017 tax act on our present and future income tax liability including the degree to which we will be able to reduce our effective us federal income tax rate due to the reduction in the statutory rate we recorded a net charge of 425 million  within our income tax provision as a provisional estimate of the net accounting impact of the 2017 tax act we recorded this charge on a provisional basis based on our present understanding of the 2017 tax act and other information available as of the time of the estimates including assumptions and expectations about future events 

although we believe these provisional amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the ultimate enactmentrelated impact the 2017 tax act will have on our consolidated financial statements we may adjust these amounts materially as additional information becomes available and we complete further analysis the impact of the 2017 tax act to our business in future periods is also subject to a variety of factors beyond our control including but not limited to i potential technical corrections or other amendments to the 2017 tax act ii potential changes to state local and foreign tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act and iii potential new or interpretative guidance issued by the sec the financial accounting standards board or the internal revenue service related to the 2017 tax act any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materiality from our current expectations or investors’ expectations further there are certain effects of the 2017 tax act we cannot reasonably estimate including effects due to a the gilti rules b the fdii deduction c the beat d provisions eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions such as deductions for interest expense executive compensation expense and certain employee expenses and e the state tax impact of the 2017 tax act as we gather analyze and consider additional data in the context of the 2017 tax act and asc 740 income taxes  we may adjust in future periods our current estimates but we will do so only during the measurement period prescribed by staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118  any such adjustment may be material 

tax legislative or regulatory initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and several international jurisdictions including canada south america europe and the asiapacific region as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition us federal state local and foreign tax laws and 

  

regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that relevant tax authorities will not challenge our tax positions or that we would succeed in defending against any such challenge 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we have in the past sustained net operating losses that we may use to reduce future taxable income utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange net operating losses to reduce its postchange income may be limited we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce us federal and state taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

changes to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net us deferred tax assets 

we have deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently do not maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets we may experience in the future a decline in us federal taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results 

we depend on key personnel 

we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new and enhanced offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel or a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on approximately 130 senior employees to lead and direct our business our senior leadership team slt is comprised of our and our subsidiaries executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market the members of the slt hold positions such as facility general manager vice presidentgeneral manager of business unit commercial development vice president of quality and regulatory activities and vice presidentfinance 

with respect to our technical talent we have approximately 1800 scientists and technicians  whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like those in which our morrisville north carolina brussels belgium woodstock illinois madison wisconsin emeryville california bloomington indiana and schorndorf germany facilities are located global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

we use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations compile and analyze financial and operational data and communicate among our employees customers and counterparties and the risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations we are continuously working to install new and upgrade existing systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber security risks to enhance the protections available to us but such protections may be inadequate to address malicious attacks or inadvertent compromises of data security 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 



  

 we deploy defenses against cyberattack and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques hardware and software typical of companies of our size and scope despite our security measures however our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by increasingly sophisticated intruders or others who try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems they are also susceptible to breach due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period 

we engage from time to time in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or divest of nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom the failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations 

our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities or divest assets or an ongoing business of one or more of our subsidiaries we may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the us and foreign jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration we or the purchaser of a divested asset or business may not be able to complete a desired acquisition or disposition respectively for reasons including but not limited to a failure to secure financing 

any acquisition that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing desired divestitures as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or continue to absorb the costs of lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestiture whether we are able to complete it or not may involve a number of risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with maintaining the business of the targeted divestiture during the disposition process and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring remaining portions of the operations of the business to other facilities 

our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties andor that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the 

  

pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claim that our offerings or processes infringe thirdparty intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of the claims merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters if any such claim results in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to 

 in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa and the us occupational safety  health administration and equivalent local state and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material that are included in our offerings and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded reserves we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us and such activities may result in unanticipated costs or management distraction 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we employ approximately 10700  employees worldwide including approximately 5500  employees in north america 3700  in europe 900  in south america and 600  in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils or labor organizations are active at all of our european facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environmentslaws our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities collective bargaining or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employmentrelated costs or may result in work stoppages or other 

  

labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make to increase the funding level will reduce the cash available for our business or to discharge our financial obligations 

certain of our current and former employees in the us the uk germany france japan belgium switzerland and australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2018  the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was 730 million  primarily related to our pension plans in the uk and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of 390 million  as of june 30 2018  related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns applicable actuarial assumptions prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness 

  

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business expose us to interestrate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness 

we are highly leveraged as of june 30 2018  we had 15873 million  dollar equivalent of senior secured indebtedness 450 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2026 the usd notes €3800 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2024 the euro notes and together with the usd notes the senior notes and 1889 million  of deferred purchase consideration related to the acquisition of catalent indiana as well as an additional 1948 million  of unutilized capacity and 52 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 

 our total interest expense net was 1114 million  901 million  and 885 million  for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloating rate debt an increase of 100 basis points in floating rates would increase our annual interest expense by 124 million  

  

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a 

  

number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of operating company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply which operating companys amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may 20 2014 as amended the credit agreement calls restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of crossdefault provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness or changes in foreign currency and any such instrument may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into interestrate swap agreements foreign currency swap agreements or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments may result in economic losses if for example prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixedrate commitment any such swap will expose us to creditrelated risks that if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may change significantly and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile since shares of our common stock were offered for sale in our initial public offering on july 31 2014 through june 30 2018 our common stock price ranged from 1892 to 4787 the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed in risks related to our business and our industry and the following 



  

 broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on whether our stockholders choose to hold for the long term 

following periods of market volatility stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses if we become involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future you may not receive any return on your investment in your stock unless you sell it for a net price greater than that which you paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend for the foreseeable future our board of directors has also authorized a stock buyback program that we may use from time to time to purchase our common stock any future decision to pay a dividend and the amount and timing of any future dividend on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend numerous factors including general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future alternative deployments of our cash our future capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock has been affected in part by the research and reports that industry and financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts furthermore if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or our industry change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors or other healthcare sector companies or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price of our stock could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

  

future sales or the perception of future sales of common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

as of august 21 2018  31120 shares of our common stock representing less than 1 of our total outstanding shares of common stock are restricted securities within the meaning of the secs rule 144 promulgated under the securities act rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 

in addition 2703136  shares of common stock may become eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options a total of 6700000  shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2014 omnibus incentive plan of which 1143702  shares of common stock remain available for future issuance at august 21 2018 these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other equity securities that we wish to issue in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the nyse or to restrictions set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments acquisitions or otherwise may result in dilution to you 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

 our board of directors has recommended subject to shareholder approval at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders that the classification of the board of directors be eliminated over a threeyear period and that all directors elected without staggered threeyear terms be subject to removal without cause provisions such as those just described to the extent that they remain in effect could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares

critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenues and expenses 

net revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health customers the majority of our business is conducted through supply development or feeforservice agreements the majority of our revenue is charged on a priceperunit basis and is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the product or service revenue generated from development arrangements is generally priced by project and is recognized either upon completion of the required service or achievement of a specified project phase or milestone 

our overall net revenue is generally affected by the following factors 

 operating expenses 

cost of sales consists of direct costs incurred to manufacture and package products and costs associated with supplying other revenuegenerating services cost of sales includes labor costs for employees involved in the production process and the cost of raw materials and components used in the process or product cost of sales also includes labor costs of employees supporting the production process such as production management quality engineering and other direct support services other costs in this category include the external research and development costs we incur on behalf of our customers depreciation of fixed assets directly supporting our manufacturing and services activities utility costs freight operating lease expenses and other general manufacturing expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative expenses to support our businesses the category includes salaries and related benefit costs of employees supporting our sales and marketing finance human resources information technology and legal functions research and development costs in pursuit of our own proactive development and costs related to executive management other costs in this category include depreciation of fixed assets amortization of our intangible assets professional fees and marketing and other expenses to support selling and administrative areas   

direct expenses incurred by a segment are included in that segment’s results shared sales and marketing information technology services and general administrative costs are allocated to each segment based upon the specific activity being performed for each segment or are charged on the basis of the segment’s proportion of our revenues or other applicable measurement certain corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments we do not allocate the following costs to the segments 



  

 our operating expenses are generally affected by the following factors 

 longlived and other definitelived intangible assets 

we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

 if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles andor longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis to be generated from such assets if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable we measure any impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets see notes 4  and 16  to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with accounting standard codification  asc 350  goodwill intangible and other assets  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually using both qualitative and quantitative assessments our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2018 was conducted as of april 1 2018  we assess goodwill for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we determine the fair value of our reporting units utilizing estimated future discounted cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would use in addition we use comparative market information and other factors to corroborate the discounted cash flow results no reporting unit was at risk of failing step one in the goodwill impairment test under the provisions of asc 350 as of april 1 2018  see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred 

  

taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested we have recorded a provision for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to repatriations as a result of tax reform but we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries 

because of the complexity of the new gilti tax rules we continue to evaluate this provision of the 2017 tax act and the application of asc 740 in accordance with asc 740 we will make an accounting policy election of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into the companys measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules will depend in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti and if so what the impact of these inclusions is expected to be whether we expect to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends on not only our current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also our intent and ability to modify this structure therefore we have not made any adjustment related to potential gilti tax in our consolidated financial statements and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred tax on gilti 

we had valuation allowances of 862 million  and 788 million as of june 30 2018  and 2017  respectively against our deferred tax assets we considered all available evidence both positive and negative in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

 we considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law further there is no prior year to which we can carry back the net operating losses the deferred tax liabilities are expected to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to a portion of the deferred tax assets 

the state valuation allowance on 4180 million of apportioned state net operating losses was maintained due to uncertainty around earnings apportionment certain restrictions at the state level and the history of tax losses anticipated utilization rates were not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence and allow a release 

asc 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merits we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 

the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution at june 30 2018  and 2017  we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 41 million and 575 million respectively 

the anticipated future trends included in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets are the same assumptions and anticipated future trends that were incorporated into the estimated fair value of our reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment such assumptions and anticipated future trends were also incorporated into other assessments of our tangible and intangible assets for impairment as applicable we are not currently relying on any taxplanning strategy to support the realization of deferred tax assets 

  

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our annual financial reporting periods end on june 30 our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental europe and the uk the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms in fiscal 2017 we completed the acquisitions of pharmatek based in the us in september 2016 and accucaps based in canada in february 2017 which have been integrated into our oral drug delivery and softgel technologies segments respectively in fiscal 2018 we acquired catalent indiana in order to enhance our biologics capabilities and it has been integrated into our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment 

foreign exchange rates 

our operating network is global and as a result we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2018  approximately 50  of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the united states significant foreign currencies include the british pound the euro the brazilian real the argentine peso the japanese yen the canadian dollar and the australian dollar 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry which has been estimated to generate 900 billion in annual revenue including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors and animal health innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in earlystage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals biologics and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

  

nongaap performance metrics 

as described in this section management uses various financial metrics including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in us gaap to measure and assess the performance of our business and to make critical business decisions we therefore believe that presentation of certain of these nongaap metrics in this annual report on form 10k will aid investors in understanding our business performance 

use of ebitda from continuing operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest expense expensebenefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted for the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests ebitda from continuing operations ebitda from continuing operations is not defined under us gaap is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from continuing operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of noncash depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from continuing operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the consolidated financial statements and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from continuing operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the most directly comparable measure to ebitda from continuing operations defined under us gaap is earningsloss from continuing operations included in this managements discussion and analysis is a reconciliation of earningsloss from continuing operations to ebitda from continuing operations 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other incomeexpense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expensebenefit and depreciation and amortization segment ebitda 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report on form 10k we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

  

summary threeyear key financial performance metrics 

the below tables summarize our recent threeyear results on several financial metrics we use to measure performance refer to the discussions below regarding performance and use of key financial metrics 

fiscal year ended june 30 2018  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017   

results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  were as follows 



 percentage not meaningful 

net revenue 

net revenue increased  by 3259 million  or 16  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange we acquired catalent indiana in october 2017 which is included within our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment accucaps in february 2017 which is included within our softgel technologies segment and pharmatek in september 2016 which is included within our oral dose delivery segment further excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures net revenue increased 4 primarily due to increased volume in our storage and distribution business and lowermargin comparator sourcing within our clinical supply services segment and favorable endmarket demand for products within our biologics and specialty drug delivery solutions segment partially offset by product participation revenue 

  

gross margin 

gross margin increased  by 841 million  or 13  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to increased sales volumes as discussed above on a constant currency basis gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 308  in the twelve months ended june 30 2018  a decrease from the prior year primarily driven by decreased productparticipation revenue within both our softgel technologies and our oral dose delivery segments and an unfavorable mix shift within our softgel technologies segment to lowermargin consumer health products as a result of the accucaps acquisition partially offset by a favorable mix shift to certain higher margin offerings as a result of our catalent indiana acquisition within our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased  by 552 million  or 14  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily driven by acquisitionrelated expenses during the year including onetime transaction fees of 11 million related to the acquisition of catalent indiana additionally there were incremental selling general and additional administrative expenses from acquired companies of 34 million primarily driven by 18 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense and 7 million of employeerelated costs selling general and administrative expenses further increased approximately 6 million for noncash equitybased compensation driven by the achievement of certain performancebased metrics during the fiscal year 

impairment charges and loss on sale of assets 

impairment charges for the twelve months ended june 30 2018  and june 30 2017 were 87 million  and 98 million respectively with the change primarily driven by the loss on the sales of two softgel technologies segment manufacturing sites in the asia pacific region during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and the disposition of a cost method investment the site divestitures were not material either individually or in the aggregate to the segment or to our business as a whole impairment charges in the prior year were related to fixed assets that ceased being used and whose value was therefore not recoverable 

restructuring and other 

restructuring and other charges of 102 million  in fiscal 2018   increased  by 22 million  or 28  compared to the amount in fiscal 2017  and were driven by increases in employeerelated actions to further streamline the business other costs in fiscal 2017  included claimresolution charges of 32 million which were subsequently recovered through insurance related to a temporary regulatory suspension at one of our manufacturing facilities during fiscal 2016 restructuring expense will vary periodtoperiod based on site consolidation efforts and other efforts to further streamline the business 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 1114 million  in fiscal 2018   increased  by 213 million  or 24  compared to fiscal 2017  primarily driven by higher levels of outstanding debt associated with the financing for the catalent indiana acquisition in october 2017 partially offset by principal payments on our term loans and an overall reduction in our interest rates on our senior secured credit facilities as compared to the prioryear period 

in october 2017 operating company completed a private offering the debt offering of usd notes the usd notes bear interest at the rate of 4875 per annum and are payable semiannually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year concurrent with the debt offering operating company completed amendment no 3 the third amendment to its credit agreement which governs the senior secured credit facilities that provide us dollardenominated term loans eurodenominated term loans and a revolving credit facility the third amendment lowered the interest rate on the term loans and the revolving credit facility the applicable rate for us dollardenominated term loans decreased 050 the applicable rate for eurodenominated term loans decreased 075 and the applicable rate for the revolving loans decreased 125 for additional information concerning the terms of the credit agreement and the third amendment see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

a component of the purchase price for the catalent indiana acquisition consists of 200 million in deferred purchase consideration payable in four annual 50 million installments the present value of which is accounted for as debt with the remainder considered imputed interest expense 

on december 9 2016 operating company completed a private offering of the euro notes the euro notes bear interest at the rate of 475 per annum and are payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year 

  

other incomeexpense net 

other expense  net of 77 million  for fiscal 2018  was primarily driven by financing charges of 118 million related to the debt offering and the third amendment which included a 61 million charge for commitment fees paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 other expense net also included 46 million of foreign currency gains in the year 

other expense net for fiscal 2017  of 85 million  was primarily driven by 43 million of financing charges in the prior year and foreign currency losses of 42 million 

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

in december 2017 the us government enacted wideranging tax legislation the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act significantly revised us income tax law by among other provisions a lowering the applicable us federal statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 b creating a partial territorial tax system that includes imposing a mandatory onetime transitional tax on previously deferred foreign earnings c creating provisions regarding 1 income deemed to be global intangible low tax income gilti 2 the foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction and 3 the base erosion antiabuse tax beat and d eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions such as deductions for interest expense executive compensation expense and certain employee expenses 

in fiscal 2018  we recorded a net charge of  425 million  within our income tax provision as a provisional estimate of the net accounting impact of the 2017 tax act in accordance with in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 issued by the staff of the sec sab 118 the net charge is comprised of the following i expense of 370 million related to the mandatory transition tax for deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income net of the benefit of associated foreign tax credit ii a 114 million charge relating to the impact of provisional changes in our intentions with respect to repatriation of undistributed earnings from nonus subsidiaries iii a 04 million charge related to the change to allowed deductions for executive compensation and iv a benefit of 62 million related to a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

the impact to our business resulting from the 2017 tax act including related changes to our tax obligations and effective tax rate in future periods as well as the onetime enactmentrelated charges recorded in fiscal 2018 on a provisional basis are based on a reasonable estimate and are subject to change and any change could differ materially from our current expectations further there are certain effects of the 2017 tax act we cannot reasonably estimate as of the time of this filing including a any tax as a result of the gilti rules b the extent of any fdii deduction by us c the amount of any beat d the effect of provisions eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions such as interest expense executive compensation expense and certain employee expenses and e the state tax impact of the 2017 tax act as additional data is gathered analyzed and considered in context of the 2017 tax act and asc 740 we may record additional or different tax charges in future periods during the measurement period permitted by sab 118 

our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2018  was  684 million  relative to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of  1520 million  our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2017  was  258 million  relative to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of  1356 million  the income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to the impact of the 2017 tax act as previously discussed changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items including equity compensation generally fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item 

  

segment review 

the below charts depict the companys four segments percentage of revenue for the previous three years refer below for discussions regarding the segments revenue and ebitda performance

1 unallocated costs include restructuring and special items equitybased compensation impairment charges certain other corporatedirected costs and other costs that are not allocated to the segments as follows 



a restructuring and other special items include transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of catalent indiana and accucaps 

b other incomeexpense net of 77 million   for the twelve months ended june 30 2018 was primarily driven by financing charges of 118 million related to the debt offering and the third amendment which included a 61 million charge for commitment fees paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on the unused bridge facility discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the expense was offset by foreign currency gains in the year 

provided below is a reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations to ebitda from continuing operations 



softgel technologies segment 



softgel technologies’ net revenue increased   375 million  or 4  excluding the impact of foreign exchange as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  net revenue decreased 2  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017 excluding the impact of the accucaps acquisition and divestitures excluding the reduction in productparticipation revenue net revenue without acquisitions was flat to prior year net revenue decreased as a result of lower endmarket volume demand for consumer health products in europe and asiapacific offset by increased endmarket volume demand for prescription products in latin america 

softgel technologies’ segment ebitda increased  by 36 million  or 2  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange segment ebitda decreased 4  excluding the impact of acquisitions and 

  

divestitures excluding the reduction of product participation profit of 6 segment ebitda without acquisitions and divestitures increased 2 the increase was primarily related to a favorable shift in product mix within our prescription products in north america and asiapacific partially offset by a shortage in our supply of ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient which reduced segment ebitda by 2 

net revenue and segment ebitda in our softgel technologies segment increased compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  by 7  and 5  respectively due to the accucaps acquisition 

in december 2017 we divested two manufacturing sites in asia pacific in the softgel technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations the site divestitures resulted in a decrease to net revenue of 1 and an increase to segment ebitda of 1 in the twelve months ended june 30 2018  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  

biologics and specialty drug delivery segment 



net revenue in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment increased  by 2390 million  or 68  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange net revenue without acquisitions increased by 18  driven primarily by favorable endcustomer demand for our us based drug substance biologics offerings of 7 increased endmarket demand for products within our respiratory and ophthalmic platform of 6 and increased endmarket demand for our european based drug product biologics offerings of 5 

biologics and specialty drug delivery segment ebitda increased  by 813 million  or 128  excluding the impact of foreign exchange segment ebitda without acquisitions increased by 15  primarily due to increased volume from our us drug product biologics offerings and our european drug substance biologics offerings partially offset by deterioration in our capacity utilization within our respiratory and ophthalmic platform 

on october 23 2017 we acquired catalent indiana which increased net revenue and segment ebitda in our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment by 50  and 113  respectively in the twelve months ended june 30 2018  compared to the corresponding prioryear period 

oral drug delivery segment 



net revenue in our oral drug delivery segment decreased  by 35 million  or 1  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange excluding the 3 impact of the prior year contractual settlement within our development and analytical services platform and acquisitions net revenue increased 1 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  the increase to net revenue was driven primarily by favorable endmarket demand for certain highermargin offerings primarily in our us operations within our commercial oral delivery solutions platform of 4 partially 

  

offset by decreased demand for our development and analytical services platform of 2 driven by decreased sales volume related to feeforservice development work and analytical testing in the us and a reduction to productparticipation revenue 

oral drug delivery’s segment ebitda decreased  by 112 million  or 6  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange excluding the 10 impact of the prior year contractual settlement discussed above ebitda increased 3 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  primarily due to increased volumes related to our integrated oral solids development and manufacturing capabilities within our commercial oral delivery solutions platform partially offset by decreased productparticipation profit and decreased volume related to feeforservice development work and analytical testing in the us 

on september 22 2016 we acquired pharmatek which increased net revenue and segment ebitda in our oral drug delivery segment for the twelve months ended june 30 2018  by 1  and 1  respectively compared to the prioryear period 

clinical supply services segment 

clinical supply services’ net revenue increased by 682 million  or 20  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to higher volume related to our storage and distribution business of approximately 43 million or 12 increased lowermargin comparator sourcing volume of approximately 29 million or 8 partially offset by decreased volume related to our manufacturing and packaging business of approximately 4 million or 1 

clinical supply services’ segment ebitda increased  by 173 million  or 32  excluding the impact of foreign exchange as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2017  primarily due to increased sales volumes in our storage and distribution business improved capacity utilization across the network as well as increased profit from our lowermargin comparator sourcing we expect that our adoption in fiscal 2019 of the new revenue recognition standard asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers will result in recording comparator sourcing revenue on a net basis which should have no impact on net earnings or segment ebitda but should cause the clinical supply service segment ebitda margin to increase 4 to 6 in the next fiscal year 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2016   

results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  are as follows 



  percentage not meaningful 

net revenue 

net revenue increased by 2821 million or 15 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales increased across all four reportable segments led primarily by our oral drug delivery segment the increase in net revenue was primarily due to favorable endmarket customer demand for certain offerings within our oral drug delivery segment and our biologics offerings within our biologics and specialty drug delivery segment net revenue also increased due to endmarket volume demand for our higher margin prescription products in europe within our softgel technologies segment compared to lower production levels related to a temporary suspension of operations at one facility in the prior fiscal year we also acquired pharmatek in september 2016 and accucaps in february 2017 which increased net revenue within our oral drug delivery and our softgel technologies segments respectively

gross margin increased by 899 million or 15 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to increased volumes and favorable product mix within our oral delivery solutions platform within our oral drug delivery segment and increased volumes within our softgel technologies segment on a constant currency basis gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 318 in the twelve months ended june 30 2017 which was consistent with the prior fiscal year 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 503 million or 14 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to incremental employee compensation costs of approximately 35 million inclusive of certain severance payments inflationary increases and an increase in our noncash equity compensation plans of 10 million as a result of an additional year of vesting in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 selling general and administrative expense also increased 14 million including 9 million of integration costs and 2 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense because of entities we acquired during the fiscal year 

impairment charges and loss on sale of assets 

impairment charges for the twelve months ended june 30 2017 and june 30 2016 were 98 million and 27 million respectively and included charges for tangible and intangible assets that no longer generate revenue in our oral drug delivery and softgel technologies segments

restructuring and other charges of 80 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2017 decreased by 10 million or 11 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016 the twelve months ended june 30 2017 included restructuring activities of 6 million enacted to improve cost efficiency including employee severance costs from our corporate operations and across our global network other costs of 2 million included settlement charges for claim amounts that we deemed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but are not currently in a position to record under us gaap any insurance recovery with respect to such costs related to the temporary suspension of operations at a softgel manufacturing facility the priorperiod charges included restructuring initiatives enacted to improve cost efficiency at sites across our global network including costs related to a site consolidation in pursuit of synergies in our clinical supply services segment restructuring expense will vary period to period based on the level of acquisitions during the year and site consolidation efforts to further streamline the business 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 901 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2017 increased by 16 million or 2 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016 primarily driven by higher levels of outstanding debt from the euro notes issued in december 2016 offset by principal payments on the term loans under our senior secured credit facility and an overall reduction in december 2016 in our interest rates on our senior secured credit facility compared to the prioryear period the proceeds of the euro notes were used to repay 200 million of outstanding borrowings on operating companys us dollardenominated term loan pay 81 million then outstanding under the revolving credit facility pay accrued and unpaid interest and certain fees and expenses associated with the euro notes offering fund a previously announced acquisition and provide cash for general corporate purposes concurrent with the euro notes offering operating company repriced the senior secured credit facilities to lower the interest rate by 50 basis points on the us dollardenominated and by 75 basis points on the eurodenominated term loans the net increase to the outstanding senior debt balance during fiscal 2017 was 221 million compared to june 30 2016 

other incomeexpense net 

other expense net of 85 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2017 was primarily driven by noncash net losses from foreign exchange translation of 42 million recorded during the period and 43 million of financing charges related to the december 2016 euro notes offering and the repricing and partial paydown of the senior secured credit facility other income net of 156 million in the twelve months ended june 30 2016 was primarily driven by noncash net gains from foreign exchange translation recorded during the period plus earnings from our available for sale investments related to our deferred compensation plans 

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2017 was 258 million relative to earnings before income taxes of 1356 million our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2016 was 337 million relative to earnings before income taxes of 1449 million the income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items generally fluctuations in the effective tax provision are primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item our effective tax rate at june 30 2017 reflects the impact of an increase in foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate this benefit was offset by an increase in the valuation allowance and the impact of permanent difference including disallowed transaction costs and deemed dividends offset by the benefit from the stock compensation deduction and dividend income exempt from tax under local law

softgel technologies segment 



softgel technologies’ net revenue increased 916 million or 12 excluding the impact of foreign exchange compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016 net revenue increased 6 excluding the effect of the accucaps acquisition primarily driven by increased endmarket volume demand for prescription products in europe which included increased volume of approximately 38 million at a facility that had produced at lower levels in the prior year due to a temporary suspension in addition net revenue increased as a result of higher endmarket volume demand for both prescription and consumer health products in north america and latin america partially offset by lower endmarket volume demand for consumer health products in asia pacific

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and use of cash 

our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations and certain financing activities for acquisitions the principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating and capital expenditures business or asset acquisitions interest payments on debt and any mandatory or discretionary principal payment on our debt issuances as of june 30 2018  operating company had available a 200 million  revolving credit facility that matures in may 2022 following the third amendment in october 2017 the capacity of which is reduced by 52 million  of outstanding letters of credit the revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline borrowings as of june 30 2018  we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we continue to believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months we have no significant debt maturity until the senior secured term loans mature in may 2024 

us tax reform considerations 

recent changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the 2017 tax act could potentially change our future intentions regarding the reinvestment of such earnings we intend to continue to monitor regulatory developments concerning the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings as well as our liquidity needs both domestic and foreign during fiscal 2018 we repatriated 2801 million from foreign locations to the us which we intend to be available for general corporate purposes our current estimate of our cash tax liability associated with the repatriation is 26 million

debt covenants 

senior secured credit facilities 

the credit agreement contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions operating company’s and operating company’s restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares create liens on assets engage in mergers and consolidations sell assets pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock repay subordinated indebtedness engage in certain transactions with affiliates make investments loans or advances make certain acquisitions enter into sale and leaseback transactions amend material agreements governing operating company’s subordinated indebtedness and change operating company’s lines of business 

the credit agreement also contains changeofcontrol provisions and certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default the revolving credit facility requires compliance with a net leverage covenant when there is a 30 or more draw outstanding at a period end as of june 30 2018  operating company was in compliance with all material covenants under the credit agreement 

subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement permits operating company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness none of operating company’s nonus subsidiaries or puerto rico subsidiaries is a guarantor of the loans 

  

under the credit agreement operating company’s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 

  

which is defined as “consolidated ebitda” in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda is based on the definitions in the credit agreement is not defined under gaap and is subject to important limitations 

the euro notes and the usd notes 

the indentures governing the euro notes and the usd notes the indentures contain certain covenants that among other things limit the ability of operating company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee more debt or issue certain preferred shares pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments make certain investments sell certain assets create liens consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets enter into certain transactions with their affiliates and designate their subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries these covenants are subject to a number of exceptions limitations and qualifications as set forth in the indentures the indentures also contain customary events of default including but not limited to nonpayment breach of covenants and payment or acceleration defaults in certain other indebtedness of operating company or certain of its subsidiaries upon an event of default either the holders of at least 30 in principal amount of each of the thenoutstanding euro notes or the thenoutstanding usd notes or either of the trustees under the indentures may declare the applicable notes immediately due and payable or in certain circumstances the applicable notes will become automatically immediately due and payable as of june 30 2018  operating company was in compliance with all material covenants under the indentures

adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share 

the below tables summarize our recent twoyear results on several financial metrics we use to measure performance refer to the discussions below regarding performance and use of key financial metrics 

adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement the ability of operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as consolidated ebitda in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

  

the measure under us gaap most directly comparable to ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda is earningsloss from continuing operations in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are included in the definitions of ebitda from continuing operations and consolidated net income as required in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things 

 

a reconciliation between net earnings and adjusted ebitda which also shows the adjustments from ebitda from continuing operations follows 



 foreign exchange loss of 96 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2017  includes a 03 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payables b 213 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the eurodenominated debt and c 132 million of unrealized gains on intercompany loans the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate losses from the settlement of intercompany loans of 18 million intercompany loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations 

  

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share 

we also measure operating performance based on adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share which we sometimes refer to as adjusted eps which is described in the proxy statement we will file with this sec in connection with our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders and which we use as a performance metric adjusted net income is not defined under us gaap and is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations we believe that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use this measure for business planning purposes we define adjusted net income as net earningsloss adjusted for 1 earnings or loss of discontinued operations net of tax 2 amortization attributable to purchase accounting and 3 income or loss from noncontrolling interest in majorityowned operations we also make adjustments for other cash and noncash items included in the table below partially offset by our estimate of the tax effects as a result of such cash and noncash items our definition of adjusted net income may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies adjusted net income per share is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding 



 foreign exchange loss of 96 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2017  includes a 03 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payables b 213 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the eurodenominated debt and c 132 million of unrealized gains on intercompany loans the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate losses from 

  

the settlement of intercompany loans of 18 million intercompany loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations 



interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities historically we have used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floating rate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2018  we did not have any interestrate swap agreement in place that would have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans 

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate on our investments in our foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2018  we had 7973 million  of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

from time to time we may use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of june 30 2018  

   



  

   

   

   

 

the table excludes our retirement and other postemployment benefits opeb obligations the timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans in fiscal 2019  we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards beyond fiscal 2019  the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and principally depend on the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans refer to note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the table also excludes 196 million of funded deferred compensation payments owed as of june 30 2018  to certain employees participating in our deferred compensation plan the timing and amount of payments for these obligations depend on employeedirected distributions withdrawals and employment status as part of the deferred compensation plan we have a corresponding 201 million  of deferred compensation investments as of june 30 2018  which will be used to fund future obligations to the participating employees 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases and outstanding letters of credit as discussed above we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangement as of june 30 2018  see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

we have historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variablerate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2018  we did not have any interestrate swap agreement in place that would either have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans or would be considered effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchangerate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products throughout the world our foreigncurrency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreignexchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso brazilian real and australian dollar our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars the functional currency of operating company the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss utilizing periodend exchange rates foreigncurrency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in other incomeexpense net such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

history 

catalent was formed in april 2007 when affiliates of the blackstone group lp blackstone acquired the core of the pharmaceutical technologies and services pts segment of cardinal health inc cardinal cardinal had created pts through a series of acquisitions beginning with rp scherer corporation in 1998 we are a holding company that indirectly owns catalent pharma solutions inc operating company which owns directly or indirectly all of our operating subsidiaries since our 2007 acquisition we have regularly reviewed our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan and as a result we have sold five businesses and consolidated operations at five facilities integrating them into the remaining facility network we have also actively acquired new businesses and facilities completing eleven  transactions since fiscal 2012 in july 2014 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock the ipo which is listed on the new york stock exchange the nyse under the symbol ctlt blackstone genstar capital and aisling capital collectively the selling stockholders have completed several secondary offerings of their catalent common stock in the past three fiscal years in september 2016 the selling stockholders completed a final secondary offering of their remaining shares in the company and are no longer shareholders 

our competitive strengths 

leading provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions 

we are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs biologics and consumer and animal health products in the last decade we have earned revenue with respect to nearly half of the drugs based on new molecular entities nmes approved by the fda and over the past three years with respect to nearly 80 of the top 200 largestselling compounds globally with approximately 1600 scientists and technicians  worldwide and approximately 1100  patents and patent applications our expertise is in providing differentiated technologies and solutions that help our customers bring more products and better treatments to market faster for example in the highvalue area of new chemical entities nces  nearly 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us  

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope our large customer base the extensive range of products we produce our broad service offerings and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of a product ’ s lifecycle in fiscal 2017 we produced nearly 7000  distinct items across multiple categories our fiscal 2017 regulatorybased classification of revenues demonstrates this branded drugs 40 generic prescription drugs 11 biologics 14 overthecounter 14 and consumer health veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics 21 combined in fiscal 2017  our top 20 products represented approximately 24 of total revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of revenue and with no individual product greater than 3 we serve more than 1000  customers in approximately 80 countries with a majority of our fiscal 2017  revenues coming from outside the united states this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payerdriven pricing pressures experienced by our branded drug and biologic customers 

  

longstanding extensive relationships with blue chip customers 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2017  we did business with 85  of the top 100 branded drug marketers 23 of the top 25 generics marketers 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 22 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with more than 1000  other customers including emerging and specialty companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs 

we believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers   

deep broad and growing technology foundation 

our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants our leading softgel platforms including liquigels optishell and vegicaps capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family optipact and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory ophthalmic and injectable routes including the blowfillseal unit dose technology advasept glassfree vials and prefilled syringes we also provide advanced biologics formulation options including gene product expression gpex cellline and smartag antibodydrug conjugate technologies we have a market leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and intranasal forms we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last five years as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications including the fiscal 2016 launch of our optiform solution suite a dose formagnostic bioavailability enhancement program for earlystage molecules our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies our scientists and engineers and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network our global product development team drives a focused application of resources to our highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development as of june 30 2017  we had nearly 800  product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years see contractual arrangements for more detail nearly twothirds of our fiscal 2017  advanced delivery technology platform revenues comprised of our softgel technologies and drug delivery solutions reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage 

significant recent growth investments 

we have made significant investments over time to establish a global manufacturing network and today employ 53 million  square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space across five continents we have invested approximately 665 million  in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive ongoing and continuous improvements in safety productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other applicable requirements following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have nearly 1400  employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda  with the remaining facilities registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency the ema in some cases facilities are registered with multiple 

  

regulatory agencies in fiscal 2017  we were subject to 53 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed more than 250 regulatory audits  we also undergo more than 400 customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a competitive differentiator for catalent 

strong and experienced management team 

our executive leadership team collectively has more than 200 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of more than 20 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships 

our strategy 

we are pursuing the following key growth initiatives 

follow the molecule ®  providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for early preclinical development of small molecules biologics and antibodydrug conjugates to formulation and analytical services through clinical development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for therapeutic trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing expertise that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in appropriate dosage forms the relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life including with additional customers through potential generic launches or overthecounter conversion for prescription products we are typically the sole andor exclusive provider and are reflected in customers’ new drug applications our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of an innovator drugs market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply both branded and generic customers 

an example of this can be found in a leading overthecounter respiratory brand which today uses both our zydis fast dissolve and our liquigels softgel technologies we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription zydis product for six years and we have continued to provide the zydis form since the switch to overthecounter status in the united states and other markets in the early 2000s more recently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 25year long relationship across multiple formats and markets 

customer product pipeline  continuing to grow through new projects and product launches 

we intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized advanced delivery technology products with new development programs as of june 30 2017  our product development teams were working on nearly 800  new customer programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our expanded capabilities and technologies although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical biological and customer and animal health products we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in the year ended june 30 2017  we introduced 183 new products consistent with the prior year level 

catalent continues to be the global leader in providing chemistry manufacturing and controlsbased product development services to the global pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health industry driven by thousands of projects annually in the year ended june 30 2017  we recognized approximately 409 million of revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers included in our softgel technologies and drug delivery solutions reporting segments up 24 from the prior year in addition substantially all of the revenues associated with the clinical supply services segment relate to our support of customer products in development 

  

capabilities  capacity  expanding in biologics and other attractive markets 

recognizing the strategic importance of biologics we began to build a differentiated biologics cellline and formulation development platform in 2002 since then the company has invested more than 150 million to create our catalent biologics offering included in our drug delivery solutions segment today catalent is a recognized leader in advanced cellline development and formulation and increasingly in specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substance for use in clinical trials and bioanalytical analysis during fiscal 2017 the second production suite in our madison wisconsin facility came online and we broke ground for the third suite which will take us to commercial scale supply we have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for more than 600 products many using our advanced gpex technology we have invested in a secondgeneration antibodydrug conjugate technology smartag and in fiscal 2017 we licensed rights to a development stage adc product we created and saw continued progress in our customers’ smartag product development activities we expect to continue to expand our biologics presence through both organic and potential inorganic investments 

in addition to biologics we have increased our existing investments in several facilities in order to expand in attractive markets including a recently completed significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in kentucky and the scalingup of commercial manufacturing capacity for metereddose inhalers we have also inorganically added key new capabilities in early development via our fiscal 2017 acquisition of pharmatek and expanded our north american consumer health softgel capacity via our accucaps acquisition 

advanced technologies  capitalize on our substantial platforms 

we have broad and diverse technology platform that are supported by extensive knowhow and approximately 1100  patents and patent applications in approximately 100 families across advanced delivery technologies drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation knowhow databases and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result nearly 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us  

in addition to resolving product challenges for our customers’ molecules for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proofofconcept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for selfcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

operational leverage  deploy existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our lean manufacturing and lean six sigma programs a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability we intend to continue to apply this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2009 we have expanded gross margin by over 400 basis points  and adjusted ebitda margin by over 200 basis points  note that that adjusted ebitda is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and that further explanations of this metric and comparisons to the most nearly comparable us gaap metrics are set forth below at management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—historical and adjusted ebitda 

strategic acquisitions and licensing  build on our existing platform 

we operate in highly fragmented markets in both our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions businesses within those markets the five top players represent nearly 35 and 10 of the total market share respectively by revenue our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets and to generate operating leverage through such acquisitions since fiscal 2012 we have executed eleven  transactions investing approximately 900 million and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

while we are rigorously focused on driving catalents organic growth we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolton strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments we have a dedicated corporate 

  

development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions

we follow a hybrid demand generation organization model with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering all business development and field sales representatives ultimately report to a single sales head and significant ongoing investments are made to enhance their skills and capabilities our sales organization currently consists of more than 150  fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings as part of our marketing efforts we participate in major trade shows relevant to the offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and target customers and that our brand identity has become a competitive advantage for us 

  

global accounts 

we manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential we recorded approximately 26 of our total revenue in fiscal 2017  from these global accounts each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to produce their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of customers in the market 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses and quality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice minimum volume commitments royalties profitsharing and fixed fees we employ a range of capacity access approaches from standard to completely dedicated capacity models based on customer and product needs we generally secure pricing and contract mechanisms in our supply agreements that allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements provide for our ability to renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials utilized in the products we make our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions in addition our manufacturing supply agreement terms range from three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our softgel and drug delivery solutions segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our clinical supply services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2017  our backlog was approximately 10522 million as compared to approximately 8275 million  as of june 30 2016  including approximately 3383 million and 2921 million  respectively related to our clinical supply services segment we expect to recognize approximately 83 of revenue from the backlog in existence as of june 30 2017  by the completion of the fiscal year ending june 30 2018  

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world we have thirtyfive  facilities three locations each operate as two facilities for different reporting segments on five continents with 53 million  square feet of manufacturing lab and related space our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

  

we operate our plants in accordance with cgmp or other applicable requirements more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda  with the remaining facilities being registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases our facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested approximately 4204 million  of cash outflows in our manufacturing facilities since fiscal 2015  through improvements and expansions in our facilities including approximately 1398 million  on capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 we believe that our facilities and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2017 we achieved approximately 98 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including lean six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for our softgel technologies segment packaging films for our clinical supply services segment and resin for our blowfillseal business in our drug delivery solutions segment the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics geopolitical and other issues for example commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval periods 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability and we have an active and effective supplier audit program we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see risk factors—risks relating to our business and industry— our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials   

competition 

we compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally including with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these services internally where possible 

  

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant consistency of operational performance quality price value and speed while we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable companies 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements costs incurred in connection with the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses such research and development costs included in selling general and administrative expenses amounted to 70 million  76 million  and 122 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  june 30 2016  and june 30 2015  respectively costs incurred in connection with research and development services we provide to customers and services performed in support of the commercial manufacturing process for customers are recorded within cost of sales such research and development costs included in cost of sales amounted to 458 million  474 million  and 413 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017  june 30 2016  and june 30 2015  respectively 

employees 

as of june 30 2017  we had approximately 10800 employees in thirtyfive facilities on five continents twelve  facilities are in the united states with certain employees at one facility being represented by a labor organization with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all eleven  of our european facilities consistent with labor environmentslaws in european countries similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist at our plants in canada argentina brazil and australia our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 



corporate responsibility 

a sense of responsibility to our employees customers and suppliers and the communities in which we operate and a desire to work to sustain the environments and resources affected by our activities are integrated into the heart of our business as we fulfill our purpose to help people live better healthier lives we take our corporate responsibilities seriously we believe that we succeed as an organization when we put the needs of the patients and other individuals who consume our drugs and other products first and we are committed to act with integrity in everything we do our employees are supporting catalent’s corporate responsibility commitment and helping millions of people around the world live better healthier lives by developing delivering and supplying reliable highquality treatments connecting to and bettering our communities promoting a healthy environment and investing in our people to help them and our business grow 

our corporate responsibility council the cr council is made up of executive and senior leadership and guides the implementation of our corporate responsibility strategy and commitments three subcommittees  the environmental committee the grantmaking committee and the community engagement ambassador network  of the cr council are responsible for driving progress in three key areas of our overall corporate responsibility commitment they help to embed corporate responsibility deeper into the business and align the corporate responsibility agenda with our business goals 

we are expanding our strategic grantmaking activities to focus on partnerships initiatives and programs that demonstrably promote research and development into or delivery or use of a treatment or encourage stem science technology engineering and mathematics education initiatives we intend to introduce matchinggift and volunteer grant programs for our employees while coordinating even more volunteer projects in the communities around the world in which we operate 

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings services and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations certain of our operations and products are under intellectual property licenses from third parties and in certain instances we license our technology to third parties we also have a long track record of innovation across our lines of business and to further encourage active innovation we have developed incentive compensation systems linked to patent filings and other recognition and reward programs for scientists and nonscientists alike 

  

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered and issued and also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks we hold approximately 1100  patents and patent applications worldwide in advanced drug delivery and biologics formulations and technologies and manufacturing and other areas 

we hold patents and license rights relating to certain aspects of our formulations nutritional and pharmaceutical dosage forms mammalian cell engineering and sterile manufacturing services we also hold patents relating to certain processes and products we have a number of pending patent applications in the united states and certain foreign countries and intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate we have enforced and will continue to enforce our intellectual property rights in the united states and worldwide 

we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business

risk factors 

tableend if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health companies based in north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region we also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health manufacturers that choose to source these offerings internally 

we face material competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value and speed some competitors may have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customer requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon among other things available resources and their need to develop new products which in turn is dependent upon a number of factors including their competitors’ research development and production initiatives and the anticipated market uptake clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas in addition consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations including research and development departments and their budgets our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers we have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the amount of available policy limits require larger selfinsured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims 

  

we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 25 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability claim or other liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs similar bodies of the eu and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us among other rules affecting us we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cgmp and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the fda the dea the dhhs foreign agencies including the ema and other various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state and foreign agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our offerings are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal foreign and transnational regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals permits or registrations including those relating to products or facilities in addition any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant customers may also claim loss of profits due to lost or delayed sales although our contracts generally place substantial limits on such claims there can be no assurance that any such contractual limitation will be applicable or sufficient or fully enforced in any given situation 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal and foreign regulatory authorities we or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new products for any number of reasons 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore loss of a permit license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design formulation development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the products we supply quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations or civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such an issue could subject us to costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses the cost of which could be significant 

  

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our softgel technologies and drug delivery solutions segments due in part to strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses time and expense spent investigating the cause lost production time and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation 

our global operations are subject to economic political and regulatory risks including the risks of changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards that could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures   

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global and regional economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition including potential competition from manufacturers in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain and customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful 

the referendum in the uk and resulting decision of the uk government to consider exiting from the european union could have future adverse effects on our operations revenues and costs and therefore our profitability 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved the uk’s exit from the eu and the uk government has publicly announced that it intends to honor that vote and seek an exit there is no immediate change in either the uk or the eu as a result of this referendum and the uk government must now decide through legislative action and through negotiations with the eu and other affected parties what changes will result from the decision to exit four of our thirtyfive  facilities employing hundreds of workers are located in the uk and these facilities as well as others in our network source goods manufacture goods and provide services from or intended for the uk these facilities operate within an existing framework of trade and human capital integration with the eu and by extension the other parts of the world with which the eu has trade and immigration agreements due to future changes in the uk resulting from an eventual exit such as increased trade barriers increased tariff rates or custom duties or in anticipation of such changes our suppliers customers or employees may change their interactions with us including changes in imports to or exports from the uk changes in the requested utilization of our facilities both within and without the uk and changes in our relationships with our workforce in the uk to the extent that our facilities operate as part of a crossborder supply and distribution chain their operations may also be negatively affected by a decrease in the crossborder mobility of goods and services we cannot anticipate the nature of these changes as they largely depend on factors outside our control but the changes may result in adverse changes in our future operations revenues and costs and therefore our future profitability 

if we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies to the extent that our proprietary rights are based on patents patents are inherently of limited longevity and therefore will ultimately expire and such offerings may 

  

then become subject to competition without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations 

the success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur and this may force us to compete with third parties thereby affecting our revenue and profitability we do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any patent currently protecting our business 

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of any such legal action may be unfavorable to us 

any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some foreign countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered or issued and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks in the past third parties have occasionally opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there 

  

can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the united states or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

our use of certain intellectual property rights is also subject to license agreements with third parties for certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies if these license agreements were terminated for any reason it could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property our operations may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the united states for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents if our customers’ patents were successfully challenged and as a result subjected to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings this includes but is not limited to gelatin starch iota carrageenan petroleumbased products and resin also our customers frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product it is possible that any of our or our customers supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements import or export restrictions natural disasters international supply disruptions caused by pandemics geopolitical issues and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin is a critical component in most of the products produced in our softgel technologies segment gelatin is available from only a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from bse or otherwise any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for our customers’ products in the united states or internationally including the possible repeal or replacement of the affordable care act the aca in the united states could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our offerings in particular there is significant uncertainty about the future of the aca and healthcare laws in general in the united states while we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the aca any repeal or full or partial replacement could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customer’s products which in turn could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or business changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

  

as a global enterprise fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations  

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including our eurodenominated 475 senior notes due 2024 the notes and a portion of our senior secured credit facilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currency to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates affecting the various currencies in which we do business including as a result of the uks referendum in which voters approved the uks exit from the eu such volatility and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we have net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange net operating losses to reduce its postchange income may be limited we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce us federal and state taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

changes to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net us deferred tax assets 

we have deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently do not maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets we may experience in the future a decline in us federal taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results 

we are dependent on key personnel 

we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new enhancements offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel combined with a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on approximately 130 senior employees to lead and direct the company our senior leadership team slt is comprised of our executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market the members of the slt hold positions such as facility general manager vice presidentgeneral manager of business unit commercial development vice president of quality and regulatory activities and vice presidentfinance 

  

with respect to our technical talent we have approximately 1600 scientists and technicians  whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like those in which our morrisville north carolina brussels belgium woodstock illinois madison wisconsin emeryville california and schorndorf germany facilities are located global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

we use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations compile and analyze financial and operational data and communicate among our employees customers and counterparties and the risks generally associated with such information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 we deploy defenses against cyberattack and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques hardware and software typical of companies of our size and scope despite our security measures however our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by increasingly sophisticated intruders or others who try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems they are also susceptible to breach due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time 

we engage from time to time in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or divest of nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations 

our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies or enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to complete such transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration we may not be able to complete such transactions for reasons including but not limited to a failure to secure financing any transaction that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing divestitures as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt and continue to absorb the costs of lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestiture whether we are able to complete it or not may involve a number of risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with 

  

maintaining the business of the targeted divestiture during the disposition process and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring the operations of the business to other facilities 

our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties andor that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claim that our offerings or processes infringe thirdparty intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of the claims merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters if any such claim results in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to 

 in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa and the us occupational safety  health administration and equivalent local state and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material that are included in our offerings and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take 

  

additional unplanned remedial measures for which no reserves have been recorded we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we employ approximately 10800  employees worldwide including approximately 5200  employees in north america 3900  in europe 900  in south america and 800  in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all of our european facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environmentslaws our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities collective bargaining or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employmentrelated costs or may result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make will reduce the cash available for our business or to discharge our financial obligations 

certain of our current and former employees in the us the uk germany france japan belgium and switzerland and australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2017  the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was approximately 860 million  primarily related to our pension plans in the uk and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of approximately 391 million  as of june 30 2017  related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns applicable actuarial assumptions prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness 

  

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business expose us to interestrate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness 

we are highly leveraged as of june 30 2017  we had 15962 million  dollar equivalent of senior indebtedness and 4243 million  of notes an additional 188 million  of unutilized capacity and 120 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 



  

 our total interest expense net was 901 million  885 million  and 1050 million  for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloating rate debt an increase of 100 basis points in floating rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 126 million  

  

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of operating company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply which our amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may 20 2014 as amended the credit agreement calls restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of crossdefault provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness and any such instruments may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into interestrate swap agreements or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments may result in economic losses if for example prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixedrate commitment any such swap will expose us to creditrelated risks that if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may change significantly and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile since shares of our common stock were offered for sale in our initial public offering on july 31 2014 through june 30 2017 our common stock price ranged from 

  

1892 to 3873  the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed in risks related to our business and our industry and the following 

 broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on whether our stockholders choose to hold for the long term 

following periods of market volatility stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses if we become involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future you may not receive any return on your investment in your stock unless you sell it for a net price greater than that which you paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend for the foreseeable future our board of directors has also authorized a stock buyback program that we may use from time to time to purchase our common stock any future decision to pay a dividend and the amount and timing of any future dividend on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend numerous factors including general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future alternative deployments of our cash our future capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale 

  

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock has been affected in part by the research and reports that industry and financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts furthermore if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or our industry change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors or other healthcare sector companies or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price of our stock could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

future sales or the perception of future sales of common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

as of august 24 2017  43720 shares of our common stock representing less than 1 of our total outstanding shares of common stock are restricted securities within the meaning of the secs rule 144 promulgated under the securities act rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 

in addition 1581761 shares of common stock may become eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options a total of 6700000  shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2014 omnibus incentive plan of which 2398417 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance at august 25 2017  these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other equity securities that we wish to issue in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the nyse any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in dilution to you 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

 these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares

from time to time the company may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including without limitation inquiries and claims concerning environmental contamination as well as litigation and allegations in connection with acquisitions product liability manufacturing or packaging defects and claims for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of any of which could be significant the company intends to vigorously defend itself against any such litigation and does not currently believe that the outcome of any such litigation will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial statements in addition the healthcare industry is highly regulated and government agencies continue to scrutinize certain practices affecting government programs and otherwise 

from time to time the company receives subpoenas or requests for information relating to the business practices and activities of customers or suppliers from various governmental agencies or private parties including from state attorneys general the us department of justice and private parties engaged in patent infringement antitrust tort and other litigation the company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a timely and thorough manner which responses sometimes require considerable time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred the company expects to incur costs in future periods in connection with future requests

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenues and expenses 

net revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health customers the majority of our business is conducted through supply or development agreements the majority of our revenue is charged on a priceperunit basis and is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the product or service revenue generated from development arrangements are generally priced by project and are recognized either upon completion of the required service or achievement of a specified project phase or milestone 

our overall net revenue is generally affected by the following factors 



  

 operating expenses 

cost of sales consists of direct costs incurred to manufacture and package products and costs associated with supplying other revenuegenerating services cost of sales includes labor costs for employees involved in the production process and the cost of raw materials and components used in the process or product cost of sales also includes labor costs of employees supporting the production process such as production management quality engineering and other support services other costs in this category include the external research and development costs on behalf of our customers depreciation of fixed assets utility costs freight operating lease expenses and other general manufacturing expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative expenses to support our businesses the category includes salaries and related benefit costs of employees supporting our sales and marketing finance human resources information technology and legal functions research and development costs in pursuit of our own proactive development and costs related to executive management other costs in this category include depreciation of fixed assets amortization of our intangible assets professional fees and marketing and other expenses to support selling and administrative areas   

direct expenses incurred by a segment are included in that segment’s results shared sales and marketing information technology services and general administrative costs are allocated to each segment based upon the specific activity being performed for each segment or are charged on the basis of the segment’s respective revenues or other applicable measurement certain corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments we do not allocate the following costs to the segments 

 our operating expenses are generally affected by the following factors 

 allowance for inventory obsolescence 

we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional inventory writedowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 

longlived and other definitelived intangible assets 

we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life 

  

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

 if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles andor longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis to be generated from such assets if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable we measure any impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets see note 4  and 16  to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with accounting standard codification  asc 350  goodwill intangible and other assets  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually utilizing both qualitative and quantitative assessments our annual goodwill impairment test was conducted as of april 1 2017  we assess goodwill for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we determine the fair value of our reporting units utilizing estimated future discounted cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize in addition we use comparative market information and other factors to corroborate the discounted cash flow results no reporting units were at risk of failing step one in the goodwill impairment test under the provisions of asc 350 as of april 1 2017  see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries 

we had valuation allowances of 788 million  and 699 million  as of june 30 2017  and 2016  respectively against our deferred tax assets we considered all available evidence both positive and negative in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluated three possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

 we considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets would be realized based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law the deferred tax liabilities are expected to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to a portion of the deferred tax assets 

the state valuation allowance on 3863 million of apportioned state net operating losses was maintained due to uncertainty around earnings apportionment certain restrictions at the state level and the history of tax losses anticipated utilization rates were not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence and allow a release 

asc 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merits we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 

  

the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution at june 30 2017  and 2016  we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 575 million and 671 million  respectively 

the anticipated future trends included in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets are the same assumptions and anticipated future trends that were incorporated into the estimated fair value of our reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment such assumptions and anticipated future trends were also incorporated into other assessments of our tangible and intangible assets for impairment as applicable we are not currently relying on any taxplanning strategy to support the realization of deferred tax assets

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our financial reporting periods operate on a june 30 fiscal year end our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental europe and the united kingdom the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we are able to complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms since january 1 2012 we have completed eleven  acquisitions in the recent three fiscal years the company acquired the remaining shares of redwood bioscience inc redwood and its smartag adc technology platform in october 2014 the acquired business is based in the us and is included in the drug delivery solutions segment additionally in november 2014 the company acquired 100 of the shares of mti pharma solutions inc micron technologies the acquired business is based in the us and the uk and is included in the drug delivery solutions segment finally in fiscal 2017 we completed acquisitions of pharmatek based in the us and accucaps based in canada which have been integrated in our drug delivery solutions and softgel technologies segments respectively 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenues and costs are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates our operating network is global and as a result our revenues and operating expenses are influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2017  approximately 52  of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the united states much of the revenue generated outside the united states and many of the expenses associated with our operations outside the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar particularly the british pound the euro the brazilian real the argentine peso the japanese yen and the australian dollar changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will affect our revenues and expenses 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the 900 billion annual revenue global pharmaceutical industry including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors and animal health innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market while generic drug share is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed 

market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of such demand through greater use of generic drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in earlystage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity sustain our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the appointment of strategic partners for important outsourced functions additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have full rd infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations will continue to drive increases in demand for both pharmaceutical and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

nongaap performance metrics 

use of ebitda from continuing operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest expense expensebenefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization and is adjusted for the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests ebitda from continuing operations ebitda from continuing operations is not defined under us gaap and is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from continuing operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from continuing operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the consolidated financial statements and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from continuing operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies the most directly comparable measure to ebitda from continuing operations defined under us gaap is earningsloss from continuing operations included in this report is a reconciliation of earningsloss from continuing operations to ebitda from continuing operations 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other incomeexpense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expensebenefit and depreciation and amortization segment ebitda 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report on form 10k we calculate constant currency by calculating 

  

currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016   

results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  were as follows 



  percentage not meaningful 

net revenue 

net revenue increased  by 2821 million  or 15  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016  excluding the impact of foreign exchange sales increased across all three reportable segments led primarily by our drug delivery solutions segment the increase in net revenue was primarily due to favorable endmarket customer demand for certain offerings within our oral delivery solutions platform and our biologics offerings within our drug delivery solutions segment net revenue also increased due to endmarket volume demand for our higher margin prescription products in europe within our softgel technologies segment compared to lower production levels related to a temporary suspension of operations at one facility in the prior fiscal year we also acquired pharmatek in september 2016 and accucaps in february 2017 which increased net revenue within our drug delivery solutions and our softgel technologies segments respectively 

gross margin 

gross margin increased  by 899 million  or 15  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to increased volumes and favorable product mix within our oral delivery solutions platform and our biologics offering within our drug delivery solutions segment and increased volumes within our softgel technologies segment on a constant currency basis gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 318  in the twelve months ended june 30 2017  which was consistent with the prior fiscal year 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased  by 503 million  or 14  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to incremental employee compensation costs of 

  

approximately 35 million inclusive of certain severance payments inflationary increases and an increase in our noncash equity compensation plans of 10 million as a result of an additional year of vesting in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 selling general and administrative expense also increased 14 million including 9 million of integration costs and 2 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense because of entities we acquired during the fiscal year 

impairment charges and loss on sale of assets 

impairment charges for the twelve months ended june 30 2017  and june 30 2016 were 98 million  and 27 million respectively and included charges for tangible and intangible assets that no longer generate revenue in our drug delivery solutions and softgel technologies segments

restructuring and other charges of 80 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2017   decreased  by 10 million  or 11  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016  the twelve months ended june 30 2017  included restructuring activities of 6 million enacted to improve cost efficiency including employee severance costs from our corporate operations and across our global network other costs of 2 million include settlement charges for claim amounts that the company deemed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but is not currently in a position to record under us gaap any insurance recovery with respect to such costs related to the temporary suspension of operations at a softgel manufacturing facility the prior period charges included restructuring initiatives enacted to improve cost efficiency at sites across our global network including costs related to a site consolidation in pursuit of synergies in our clinical supply services segment restructuring expense will vary period to period based on the level of acquisitions during the year and site consolidation efforts to further streamline the business 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 901 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2017   increased  by 16 million  or 2  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2016  primarily driven by higher levels of outstanding debt from the notes issued in december 2016 offset by principal payments on the term loans under our senior secured credit facility and an overall reduction in december 2016 in our interest rates on our senior secured credit facility as compared to the prior year period on december 12 2016 operating company our wholly owned subsidiary completed a private offering of €3800 million aggregate principal amount of the notes the proceeds of the notes were used to repay 200 million of outstanding borrowings on operating companys us dollar denominated term loan pay the 81 million then outstanding under its revolving credit facility pay accrued and unpaid interest and certain fees and expenses associated with the offering fund a previously announced acquisition and provide cash for general corporate purposes concurrent with the private offering of the notes we repriced the senior secured credit facilities to lower the interest rate on our us dollardenominated and eurodenominated term loans the new applicable rate for the us dollardenominated term loans is 050 lower than the previous rate and the new applicable rate for the eurodenominated term loans is 075 lower than the previous rate the net increase to our outstanding senior debt balance is 221 million as compared to june 30 2016 

other incomeexpense net 

other expense  net of 85 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2017  was primarily driven by noncash net losses from foreign exchange translation of 42 million  recorded during the period and 43 million  of financing charges related to the december 2016 private offering of the notes and the repricing and partial paydown of the senior secured credit facility other income net of 156 million  in the twelve months ended june 30 2016  was primarily driven by noncash net gains from foreign exchange translation recorded during the period plus earnings from our available for sale investments related to our deferred compensation plans 

  

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

our provision  for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2017  was 258 million  relative to earnings  before income taxes of 1356 million  our provision  for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2016  was 337 million  relative to earnings  before income taxes of 1449 million  the income tax provision  for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items generally fluctuations in the effective tax provision are primarily due to changes in our geographic pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item our effective tax provision at june 30 2017  reflects the impact of an increase in foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate this benefit is offset by an increase in the valuation allowance and the impact of permanent difference including disallowed transaction costs and deemed dividends offset by the benefit from the stock compensation deduction and dividend income exempt from tax under local law

  percentage not meaningful 

net revenue 

net revenue increased by 1127 million or 6 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase in net revenue was driven by increased sales across all three reportable segments led primarily by our softgel technologies segment the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by higher end market volume demand for consumer health products using our softgel offering increased sales volume across our drug delivery solutions segment platforms and increased comparator sourcing volume and increased sales volume related to storage and distribution revenue within our clinical supply services segment revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in volume as a result of the temporary suspension of operations at a softgel manufacturing facility which occurred between november 2015 and april 2016 

gross margin 

gross margin decreased by 14 million as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by lower volumes resulting in reduced end customer demand of certain higher margin offerings within our drug delivery solutions segment and decreased revenue resulting from the temporary suspension of operations at a softgel manufacturing facility during the period within our softgel technologies segment partially offset by higher sales volumes across all three segments and more effective absorption of fixed costs through higher capacity utilization within our softgel technologies segment on a constant currency basis gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 200 basis points to 316 in the twelve months ended june 30 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily driven by an unfavorable shift in revenue mix in our drug delivery solutions segment and in our clinical supply services segment 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 303 million or 9 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to incremental employee compensation costs of approximately 13 million inclusive of certain severance payments inflationary increases and an increase in our noncash equity compensation plans as a result of a change from a cashbased longterm incentive plan to an equitybased longterm incentive plan selling general and administrative expense also increased due to acquisitionrelated transaction costs of approximately 5 million and increased costs of approximately 6 million related to the temporary suspension of operations at a softgel manufacturing facility from november 2015 to april 2016 selling general and administrative expense increased approximately 5 million because of entities we acquired during the prior year

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 885 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2016 decreased by 165 million or 16 compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 primarily driven by lower levels of outstanding debt as compared to the prior year we redeemed 350 million of senior notes due 2018 the senior notes and 275 million of senior subordinated notes due 2017 the senior subordinated notes on august 28 2014 and september 4 2014 respectively in addition we reduced an aggregate of 2345 million of outstanding borrowings under an unsecured term loan during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 partially offset by incremental borrowings of 191 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 in support of completed acquisitions the funds utilized to reduce our debt levels were generated by proceeds from our ipo which was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2015

other income net of 156 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2016 was primarily driven by noncash net gains from foreign exchange translation recorded during the period plus earnings from our available for sale investments related to our deferred compensation plans other expense net of 424 million in the twelve months ended june 30 2015 was primarily driven by a sponsor advisory fee agreement termination fee of 298 million which we agreed to pay in connection with our ipo in addition we incurred 218 million of expense in fiscal 2015 associated with the early redemption of our senior notes and prepayment of an unsecured term loan of which 98 million was a cash expense offsetting these other expense items were nonrecurring noncash purchase accounting gains net of 89 million related to acquisitions completed during the period and 24 million of noncash net gains associated with foreign exchange 

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2016 was 337 million relative to earnings before income taxes of 1449 million our benefit for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2015 was 977 million relative to earnings before income taxes of 1125 million the income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes in our geographic pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item our effective tax rate at june 30 2016 reflects the release of the us federal valuation allowance and an increase in a tax reserve related to an adjustment to intercompany interest income in germany partially offset by a corresponding deduction in the united kingdom

provided below is a reconciliation of earnings from continuing operations to ebitda from continuing operations 



softgel technologies segment 



softgel technologies’ net revenue increased 557 million or 7 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the primary driver was higher end market volume demand for lower margin consumer health products using our softgel offering primarily in asia pacific partially offsetting the segments increased revenue was a decrease in volume of prescription products of approximately 35 million primarily in europe due to the temporary suspension of operations at one facility which occurred between november 2015 and april 2016 see below for further discussion 

 softgel technologies’ segment ebitda increased by 61 million or 4 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase was primarily driven by increased sales volumes of our lower margin consumer health products and more effective absorption of fixed costs through higher capacity utilization partially offset by the temporary suspension of operations at one facility resulting in a decrease of approximately 32 million see below for further discussion 

on november 13 2015 the primary french drug regulatory agency the ansm issued an order temporarily suspending operations at a softgel manufacturing facility which was lifted on april 28 2016 the suspension order permitted the facility to apply for exemptions for certain types of operations due to the temporary suspension we were unable to use certain raw materials work in process and finished goods and took a charge of 10 million in fiscal 2016 in connection with such loss of use we recorded remediation associated costs of 60 million in the same period further certain customers of the facility have presented claims against us for losses they have allegedly suffered due to the temporary suspension or have reserved their right to do so subsequently we are unable to estimate at this time either the total value of these claims or the likely cost to resolve them 

  

drug delivery solutions segment 



net revenue in our drug delivery solutions segment increased by 285 million or 4 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange net revenue increased approximately 3 from our analytical services platform driven by increased sales volumes related to fee for service development work and analytical testing in the us net revenue also increased approximately 2 as a result of increased volume from our biologics offerings and increased volume of products utilizing our blowfillseal technology platform of approximately 1 offsetting revenue was decreased volumes from our oral delivery solutions platform of 3 due to reduced end customer volume demand for certain higher margin offerings primarily in our us operations and lower revenue from product participation related activities finally net revenue increased approximately 1 as a result of the micron technologies acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 

drug delivery solutions’ segment ebitda decreased by 103 million or 4 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to lower volumes driven by reduced end customer demand of certain higher margin offerings and lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs within our oral delivery solutions platform partially offset by increased profit generated by our biologics offering and from products utilizing our blowfillseal technology platform 

clinical supply services segment 

clinical supply services’ net revenue increased by 285 million or 10 as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to increased lowermargin comparator sourcing volume of 13 million or 4 and increased volume related to storage and distribution revenue 

clinical supply services’ segment ebitda decreased by 11 million or 2 excluding the impact of foreign exchange as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015 primarily due to a shift to increased lowermargin comparator sourcing volume within our revenue mix in addition to increased cost related to a business update to enhance operational efficiency 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations the principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating and capital expenditures business or asset acquisitions interest payments on debt and any mandatory or discretionary principal payments on our debt issuances as of june 30 2017  our financing needs were supported by operating companys fiveyear 200 million  revolving credit facility that matures in may 2019 and is reduced by 120 million  in letters of credit the revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline borrowings as of june 30 2017  we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we continue to believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under operating companys revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months we have no significant debt maturity until the senior secured term loans mature in may 2021

operating activities 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016  cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 1553 million compared to 1717 million for the comparable prioryear period the decrease of 164 million was primarily driven by net cash outflows associated with working capital changes in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015

debt and financing arrangements 

senior secured credit facilities and second amendment 

on december 9 2016 the company completed amendment no 2 the second amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may 20 2014 in order to lower interest rates on its us dollardenominated and eurodenominated term loans governing all term loans and revolving credit facilities as amended the credit agreement the new 

  

applicable rate for the us dollardenominated term loans is based on the london interbank offered rate libor subject to a floor of 100 plus 275 which is 050 lower than the previous rate and the new applicable rate for the eurodenominated term loans is libor subject to a floor of 100 plus 250 which is 075 lower than the previous rate the second amendment further eliminates step pricing based on a measure of operating companys total leverage ratio the second amendment also includes a prepayment of 10 in the event of another repricing event on or before the six month anniversary of the second amendment an event that did not occur there was no change to maturities or covenants as a result of the second amendment 

as of june 30 2017  there were 120 million  in outstanding letters of credit which reduced the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 

the notes 

on december 9 2016 operating company completed a private offering of €3800 million aggregate principal amount of the notes the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by all of the wholly owned us subsidiaries of operating company that guarantee its senior secured credit facilities the notes were offered in the us to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule 144a under the securities act and outside the us only to nonus investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act the notes will mature on december 15 2024 bear interest at the rate of 475 per annum and are payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year the proceeds of the notes were used to repay 200 million of outstanding borrowings on the us dollardenominated term loan pay the 810 million then outstanding under the revolving credit facility pay accrued and unpaid interest and certain fees and expenses associated with the offering fund a previously announced pending acquisition and provide cash for general corporate purposes 

guarantees and security   

senior secured credit facilities 

all obligations under the credit agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured by substantially all of the following assets of operating company and each guarantor operating companys parent entity and each of operating companys material domestic subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions 

 the notes 

all obligations under the notes are general unsecured and subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the guarantors to the extent of the value of the asset securing such indebtedness the notes are guaranteed by all of operating companys wholly owned us subsidiaries that guarantee the senior secured credit facilities the notes are not guaranteed by either pts intermediate holdings llc or catalent 

debt covenants 

senior secured credit facilities 

the credit agreement contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions operating companys and operating companys restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares create liens on assets engage in mergers and consolidations sell assets pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock repay subordinated indebtedness engage in certain transactions with affiliates make investments loans or advances make certain acquisitions enter into sale and leaseback transactions amend material agreements governing operating companys subordinated indebtedness and change operating companys lines of business 

the credit agreement also contains change of control provisions and certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default the revolving credit facility requires compliance with a net leverage covenant when there is a 30 or more draw outstanding at a period end as of june 30 2017  we were in compliance with all material covenants related to our seniorsecured obligations 

  

subject to certain exceptions our credit agreement permits us and our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness none of our nonus subsidiaries or puerto rico subsidiaries is a guarantor of the loans 

the notes 

the indenture governing the notes the indenture contains covenants that among other things limit the ability of operating company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee more debt or issue certain preferred shares pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments make certain investments sell certain assets create liens consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets enter into certain transactions with their affiliates and designate their subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries these covenants are subject to a number of exceptions limitations and qualifications as set forth in the indenture the indenture also contains customary events of default including but not limited to nonpayment breach of covenants and payment or acceleration defaults in certain other indebtedness of operating company or certain of its subsidiaries under the indenture upon an event of default either the holders of at least 30 in principal amount of the thenoutstanding notes or the trustee may declare the notes immediately due and payable or in certain circumstances the notes will automatically become due and immediately payable as of june 30 2017  we were in compliance with all material covenants related to the notes 

  

liquidity in foreign subsidiaries 

as of june 30 2017  and june 30 2016  the amounts of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were 2498 million and 1291 million  respectively out of the total consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 2883 million  and 1316 million  respectively these balances are dispersed across many international locations around the world it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign legal entities in the event we need to repatriate funds from outside of the us such repatriation would likely be subject to tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not feasible to estimate the amount of us tax that might be payable on the remittance of such earnings 

historical and adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement the ability of operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as consolidated ebitda in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the measure under us gaap most directly comparable to ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda is earningsloss from continuing operations in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are included in the definitions of ebitda from continuing operations and consolidated net income as required in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things 

 

  

a reconciliation between earnings  loss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda which also shows the adjustments from ebitda from continuing operations follows 



 foreign exchange gain of 105 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2016 included 163 million of unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains primarily driven by gains of 90 million related to intercompany loans denominated in a currency different from the functional currency of either the borrower or the lender partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains of 38 million driven by the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge related to the eurodenominated debt the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate losses from the noncash and cash settlement of intercompany loans of 58 million intercompany loans are between our entities and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations 

interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities historically we have used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floating rate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2017  we did not have any interestrate swap agreement in place that would have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans 

  

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurusd exchange rate on our investments in foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2017  we had 7763 million  of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

periodically we may utilize forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not utilize foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of june 30 2017  

   

 

   

   

   

 

the table excludes our retirement and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations the timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans in fiscal 2018  we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards beyond fiscal 2018  the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans refer to note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the table also excludes approximately 154 million of funded deferred compensation payments owed as of june 30 2017  to certain employees participating in our deferred compensation plan the timing and amount of payments for these obligations are dependent on employee directed distributions withdrawals and employment status as part of the deferred compensation plan we have a corresponding 154 million  of deferred compensation investments as of june 30 2017  which will be used to fund future obligations to the participating employees 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases and letters of credit under the senior secured credit facilities we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as of june 30 2017  see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

the company has historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2017  we did not have any interestrate swap agreements in place that would either have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans or would be considered effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products throughout the world our foreign currency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso brazilian real and australian dollar our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars the functional currency of the parent the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss utilizing periodend exchange rates foreign currency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in other incomeexpense net such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

catalent was formed in april 2007 when affiliates of blackstone acquired the core of the pharmaceutical technologies and services “pts” segment of cardinal health inc “cardinal” cardinal had created pts through a series of acquisitions beginning with rp scherer corporation in 1998 with the intent of creating the world’s leading outsourcing provider of specialized marketleading solutions to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry we are a holding company that indirectly owns catalent pharma solutions inc the operating company which owns directly or indirectly all of our operating subsidiaries since our 2007 acquisition we have regularly reviewed our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan and as a result we have sold five businesses and consolidated operations at five facilities integrating them into the remaining facility network we have also actively acquired new businesses and facilities completing nine  transactions since fiscal 2012 in july 2014 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock the ipo which is now listed on the new york stock exchange the “nyse” under the symbol “ctlt” 

our competitive strengths 

leading provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions 

we are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs biologics and consumer and animal health products in the last decade we have earned revenue with respect to nearly half of the drugs based on new molecular entities “nmes” approved by the fda and over the past three years with respect to nearly 80 of the top 200 largestselling compounds globally with approximately 1400 scientists and technicians  worldwide and approximately 1100  patents and patent applications our expertise is in providing differentiated technologies and solutions that help our customers bring more products and better treatments to market faster for example in the highvalue area of nces approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us  

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope our large customer base the extensive range of products we produce our broad service offerings and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of a product ’ s lifecycle we produce nearly 7000  distinct items across multiple categories including brand and generic prescription drugs and biologics overthecounter consumer health and veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics in fiscal 2016  our top 20 products represented approximately 25 of total revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of revenue and with no individual product greater than 3 we serve more than 1000  customers in approximately 80 countries with a majority of our fiscal 2016  revenues coming from outside the united states this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payerdriven pricing pressures experienced by our branded drug and biologic customers 

longstanding extensive relationships with blue chip customers 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2016  we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 22 of the top 25 generics marketers 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 21 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with more than 1000  other customers including emerging and specialty companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs 

  

we believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers   

deep broad and growing technology foundation 

our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants our leading softgel platforms including liquigels optishell and vegicaps capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family optipact and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory ophthalmic and injectable routes including the blowfillseal unit dose technology advasept glassfree vials and prefilled syringes we also provide advanced biologics formulation options including gene product expression “gpex” cellline and smartag antibodydrug conjugate technologies we have a market leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and intranasal forms we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last four years as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications including in fiscal 2016 the launch of our optiform solutions suite a dose formagnostic bioavailability enhancement for earlystage molecules our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies our scientists and engineers and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network our global product development team drives a focused application of resources to our highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development as of june 30 2016  we had approximately 700  product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years see “contractual arrangements” for more detail nearly twothirds of our fiscal 2016  advanced delivery technology platform revenues comprised of our softgel technologies and drug delivery solutions reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage 

significant recent growth investments 

we have made significant investments over time to establish a global manufacturing network and today employ 51 million  square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space across five continents we have invested approximately 630 million  in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive ongoing and continuous improvements in safety productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have more than 1100  employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda  with the remaining facilities registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency the “ema” in some cases facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies in fiscal 2016  we were subject to 49 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed more than 250 regulatory audits  we also undergo more than 400 customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a competitive differentiator for catalent 

  

strong and experienced management team 

our executive leadership team collectively has more than 200 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of more than 20 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships 

our strategy 

we are pursuing the following key growth initiatives 

“follow the molecule” by providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for development of small molecules biologics and antibodydrug conjugates to formulation and analytical services through early stage clinical development and manufacturing of clinical trials supply to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for latestage trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing expertise that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in appropriate dosage forms the relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life including through potential generic launches or overthecounter conversion for prescription products we are typically the sole andor exclusive provider and are reflected in customers’ new drug applications 

our breadth of solutions gives us multiple entry points into the lifecycle of our customers’ molecules our initial commercial opportunity arises during the discovery and development of a molecule when our development and particle engineering solutions can be applied once a product reaches latestage development we can provide our customers with drug delivery solutions for the commercialization of their products we have two additional entry points during the commercial phase upon lossofexclusivity and upon conversion to overthecounter status at these points we partner with the makers and marketers of both generic and overthecounter products to provide them with advanced delivery technologies that can be applied to their products through these stages of the product lifecycle our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of exclusivity may not have a significant negative impact if we continue to work with both branded and generic partners 

an example of this can be found in a leading overthecounter respiratory brand which today uses both our zydis fast dissolve and our liquigels softgel technologies we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription zydis product for six years and we have continued to provide the zydis form since the switch to overthecounter status in the united states and other markets in the early 2000s more recently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 24year long relationship across multiple formats and markets 

continue to grow through new product launches and projects 

we intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized advanced delivery technology products with new development programs as of june 30 2016  our product development teams were working on approximately 700  new customer programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our investments since 2010 to expand our global sales and marketing function once developed and approved in the future we expect these programs to add to longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in the year ended june 30 2016  we introduced 184 new products which is up 12 versus new product introductions in the year ended june 30 2015  we also expect that our expanded offerings and capacity such as our optiform solutions suite bioavailability enhancement offering expanded bioanalytical testing and commercialscale metered dose inhaler production ongoing service offering and geographic network expansion in our clinical supply services business our expanded presence in brazil and our continued growth in china will further expand our active advanced delivery technologies development programs and position us for future growth   our development solutions business is driven by thousands of projects annually ranging from individual shortduration analytical projects to multiyear clinical supply programs 

catalent continues to be the global leader in providing chemistry manufacturing and controlsbased product development services to the global pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health industry in the year ended june 30 2016 we recognized approximately 330 million of revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers included in our softgel technologies and drug delivery solutions reporting segments up 19 from the prior year in addition 

  

substantially all of the revenues associated with the clinical supply services segment relate to our support of customer products in development 

accelerate growth with existing customers through increased penetration and broadening of services 

while we have a broad presence across the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries we believe there are significant opportunities for additional revenue growth in our existing customer base by providing advanced delivery solutions for new pipeline or commercial molecules and by expanding the range and depth of our development solutions used by those customers within our top 50 customers nearly 75 use less than half of our individual offerings in order to ensure we provide the most value to our customers we have increased our field sales and marketing force by approximately 20 since fiscal 2009 we have continued to follow a targeted account strategy designating certain accounts as global accounts based on current materiality partnering approach and growth potential we also designate other accounts as growth accounts based primarily on partnering approach and potential to become global accounts in the future in both cases we assign incremental business development product development resources to identify and pursue new opportunities to partner global accounts represented nearly 29  of our revenues in fiscal 2016  while growth accounts represented approximately 8  of revenues in that same period 

enter into and expand into attractive technologies and geographies 

we have made a number of internal investments in new geographies and markets including the construction and ongoing expansion of a stateoftheart biomanufacturing facility in wisconsin to serve the growing global biologics development market a recently completed significant expansion of oral solid controlled release production capacity in kentucky the scalingup of commercial manufacturing capacity for metereddose inhalers and continuing development and scaleup of the smartag™ antibodydrug conjugate technology to address the growing need for improved targeted delivery of therapeutic compounds directly to tumor sites 

in addition we intend to increase our presence in emerginghighgrowth geographies and other markets where we are currently only narrowly represented including china brazil japan and the animal health market 

capitalize on our substantial technology platform 

we have a broad and diverse technology platform that is supported by approximately 1100  patents and patent applications in approximately 100 families across advanced delivery technologies drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing this platform is supported by substantial knowhow and trade secrets that provide us with additional competitive advantages for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation databases and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us  

in addition to resolving product challenges for our customers’ molecules for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proofofconcept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for selfcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

  

leverage existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our lean manufacturing and lean six sigma programs a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability we intend to continue to apply this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2009 we have expanded gross margin by over 400 basis points  and adjusted ebitda margin by over 200 basis points  

  

pursue strategic acquisitions and licensing to build upon our existing platform 

we operate in highly fragmented markets in both our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions businesses within those markets the five top players represent nearly 35 and 10 of the total market share respectively by revenue our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets and to generate operating leverage through such acquisitions since fiscal 2012 we have executed nine  transactions investing more than 700 million and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

while we are rigorously focused on driving catalents organic growth we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolton strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments we have a dedicated corporate development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions 

our reportable segments 

in fiscal 2016 the company engaged in a business reorganization which was finalized in the fourth quarter to better align its internal business unit structure with its follow the molecule strategy under the revised structure we have created a drug delivery solutions dds operating segment which encompasses all of our modified release technologies prefilled syringes and other injectable formats blowfill seal unit dose development and manufacturing biologic cell line development analytical services micronization technologies and other conventional oral dose forms under a single dds management team additionally as part of the realignment we have created a standalone clinical supply services css operating segment and management team with a sole focus on providing global clinical supply chain management services that aim to speed our customers drugs to market further as a result of the business unit realignment our softgel technologies business now reports as a distinct operating segment our operating segments are the same as our reporting segments all prior period comparative segment information has been restated to reflect the current reportable segments in accordance with asc 280 segment reporting as discussed in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k the consolidated financial statements our offerings and services are summarized below by reporting segment

sales and marketing 

our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and consumer health companies along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices and companies in adjacent industries such as cosmetics we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2016  we did business with 87 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 22 of the top 25 generics marketers 24 of the top 25 biologics marketers and 21 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with more than 1000  other customers faced with access pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities while reducing their fixed cost base many midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies while facing the same pricing and market pressures have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills technologies and services required to bring their products to market consumer health companies require rapidly developed innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up in the fastpaced overthecounter medication and vitamins markets these market segments are all critically important to our growth but require distinct solutions marketing and sales approaches and market strategy 

we follow a hybrid demand generation organization model with global and growth account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions to selected accounts and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering all business development and field sales representatives ultimately report to a single sales head and significant ongoing investments are made to enhance their skills and capabilities our sales organization currently consists of more than 150  fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings as part of our marketing efforts we participate in major trade shows relevant to the offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and target customers and that our brand identity has become a competitive advantage for us 

global accounts 

we manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential by establishing strategic plans goals and targets we recorded approximately 29  of our total revenue in fiscal 2016  from these global accounts each global account is assigned a dedicated business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with the leadership of the sales and marketing function and other members of the executive leadership team are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship growing sales profitability and increasing account penetration are key goals and are directly linked to compensation account leaders also work closely with the rest of the sales organization to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

  

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to produce their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of customers in the market 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses and quality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice royalties profitsharing and fixed fees we employ a range of capacity access approaches from standard to completely dedicated capacity models based on consumer and product needs we generally secure pricing and contract mechanisms in our supply agreements that allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements provide for our ability to renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials utilized in the products we make our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions in addition our manufacturing supply agreement 

  

terms range from three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our softgel and dds segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our clinical supply services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2016  our backlog was approximately 8275 million  as compared to approximately 8276 million  as of june 30 2015  including approximately 2921 million  and 2460 million  respectively related to our clinical supply services segment we expect to recognize approximately 85 of revenue from the backlog in existence as of june 30 2016  by the completion of the fiscal year ending june 30 2017  

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world we have thirtythree  facilities three locations each operate as two facilities for different reporting segments on five continents with 51 million  square feet of manufacturing lab and related space our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

  

we operate our plants in accordance with cgmp more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda  with the remaining facilities being registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases our facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested approximately 4030 million  of cash outflows in our manufacturing facilities since fiscal 2014  through improvements and expansions in our facilities including approximately 1396 million  on capital expenditures in fiscal 2016  we believe that our facilities and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2016  we achieved approximately 97 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including lean six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for our softgel technologies segment packaging films for our clinical supply services segment and resin for our blowfillseal business in our drug delivery solutions segment the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics geopolitical and other issues for example the supply of gelatin is obtained from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

  

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability and we have an active and effective supplier audit program we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see “risk factors—risks relating to our business and industry—our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials” 

competition 

we compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally including with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies outsourced dose form manufacturing or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these services internally where possible 

  

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant consistency of operational performance quality price value and speed while we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable companies 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements costs incurred in connection with the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses such research and development costs included in selling general and administrative expenses amounted to 76 million  122 million  and 175 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  june 30 2015  and june 30 2014  respectively costs incurred in connection with research and development services we provide to customers and services performed in support of the commercial manufacturing process for customers are recorded within cost of sales such research and development costs included in cost of sales amounted to 474 million  413 million  and 340 million  for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016  june 30 2015  and june 30 2014  respectively 

employees 

as of june 30 2016  we had approximately 9200 employees in thirtythree facilities on five continents eleven  facilities are in the united states with certain employees at one facility being represented by a labor organization with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all twelve  of our european facilities consistent with labor environmentslaws in european countries similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist in our plants in argentina brazil and australia our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

  



intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings services and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations certain of our operations and products are under intellectual property licenses from third parties and in certain instances we license our technology to third parties we also have a long track record of innovation across our lines of business and to further encourage active innovation we have developed incentive compensation systems linked to patent filings and other recognition and reward programs for scientists and nonscientists alike 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered and issued and also hold common law rights in various trademarks and 

  

service marks we hold approximately 1100  patents and patent applications worldwide in advanced drug delivery and biologics formulations and technologies and manufacturing and other areas 

we hold patents and license rights relating to certain aspects of our formulations nutritional and pharmaceutical dosage forms mammalian cell engineering and sterile manufacturing services we also hold patents relating to certain processes and products we have a number of pending patent applications in the united states and certain foreign countries and intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate we have enforced and will continue to enforce our intellectual property rights in the united states and worldwide 

we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

regulatory matters 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of healthcare products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda other united states “us” governmental authorities and foreign regulatory authorities certain of our subsidiaries are required to register for permits andor licenses with and must comply with the operating cgmp quality and security standards of applicable domestic and foreign healthcare regulators including the fda the drug enforcement agency the “dea” the department of health and human services the “dhhs” the equivalent agencies of european union the “eu” member states and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments and comparable foreign agencies as well as various accrediting bodies each depending upon the type of operations and the locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries 

  

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to other healthcare laws including the united states federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act the controlled substances act and comparable state and foreign laws and regulations in certain of their activities 

we are also subject to various federal state local foreign and transnational laws regulations and recommendations both in the united states and abroad relating to safe working conditions laboratory and distribution practices and the use transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in addition us and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the crossborder transit of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we are also subject to various other laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

the costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal state local foreign and transnational regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition see “risk factors—risks relating to our business and industry— failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations

risk factors 

tableend if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health companies based in north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region we also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health manufacturers that choose to source these offerings internally where possible 

we face material competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value and speed some competitors may have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customer requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon among other things available resources and their need to develop new products which in turn is dependent upon a number of factors including their competitors’ research development and production initiatives and the anticipated market uptake clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas in addition consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations including research and development departments and their budgets our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers we have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the 

  

amount of available policy limits require larger selfinsured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 25 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability claim or other liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating quality and security standards of the fda the dea various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs similar bodies of the eu and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us among other rules affecting us we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cgmp and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the fda the dea the dhhs foreign agencies including the ema and other various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state and foreign agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our offerings are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal foreign and transnational regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals permits or registrations including those relating to products or facilities in addition any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant customers may also claim loss of profits due to lost or delayed sales although our contracts generally place substantial limits on such claims there can be no assurance that any such contractual limitation will be applicable or sufficient or fully enforced in any given situation 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal and foreign regulatory authorities we or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new products for any number of reasons 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition furthermore loss of a permit license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design formulation development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the products we supply quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations or civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such an issue could subject us to costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses the cost of which could be significant 

  

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our softgel technologies and drug delivery solutions segments due in part to strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses time and expense spent investigating the cause lost production time and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation 

our global operations are subject to a number of economic political and regulatory risks 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global and regional economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition including potential competition from manufacturers in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain and customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful also fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our consolidated financial results 

the recent referendum in the uk and resulting decision of the uk government to consider exiting from the european union could have future adverse effects on our revenues and costs and therefore our profitability 

in june 2016 the united kingdom the “uk” held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved the uk’s exit from the eu and the uk government has publicly announced that it intends to honor that vote and seek an exit there is no immediate change in either the uk or the eu as a result of this referendum and the uk government must now decide through legislative action and through negotiations with the eu and other affected parties what changes will result from the decision to exit four of our thirtythree  facilities employing hundreds of workers are located in the uk and these facilities as well as others in our network source goods manufacture goods and provide services from or intended for the uk due to future changes in the uk resulting from the eventual exit or in anticipation of such changes our suppliers customers or employees may change their interactions with us including changes in imports to or exports from the uk changes in the requested utilization of our facilities both within and without the uk and changes in our relationships with our workforce in the uk we cannot anticipate the nature of these changes as they largely depend on factors outside our control but the changes may result in adverse changes in our future revenues and costs and therefore our future profitability 

if we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies to the extent that our proprietary rights are based on patents patents are inherently of limited longevity and therefore will ultimately expire and such offerings may then become subject to competition without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements potential innovations intended to facilitate 

  

enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations 

the success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur and this may force us to compete with third parties thereby affecting our revenue and profitability we do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any patent currently protecting our business 

  

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and the outcome of any such legal action may be unfavorable to us 

any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some foreign countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered or issued and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks in the past third parties have occasionally opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent 

  

registrations in the united states or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

our use of certain intellectual property rights is also subject to license agreements with third parties for certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies if these license agreements were terminated for any reason it could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property our operations may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the united states for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents if our customers’ patents were successfully challenged and as a result subjected to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings this includes but is not limited to gelatin starch iota carrageenan petroleumbased products and resin also our customers frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product it is possible that any of our or our customers supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements import or export restrictions natural disasters international supply disruptions caused by pandemics geopolitical issues and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin is a critical component in most of the products produced in our softgel technologies segment gelatin is available from only a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from bse or otherwise any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for our customers’ products in the united states or internationally could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our offerings changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar and other foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations 

as a company with many international operations certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including a portion of our senior secured credit facilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currency to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the uks referendum in which 

  

voters approved the uks exit from the eu such volatility and other changes in the exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we have net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange net operating losses to reduce its postchange income may be limited we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result our ability to use our prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce us federal and state taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

we may be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in the future 

we have deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently do not maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets we may experience in the future a decline in us federal taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results 

we are dependent on key personnel 

we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new enhancements offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel combined with a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on approximately 150 senior employees  to lead and direct the company our senior leadership team “slt” is comprised of our executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market the members of the slt hold positions such as facility general manager vice presidentgeneral manager of business unit commercial development vice president of quality and regulatory activities and vice presidentfinance 

with respect to our technical talent we have approximately 1400 scientists and technicians  whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like those in which our morrisville north carolina brussels belgium woodstock illinois madison wisconsin and schorndorf germany facilities are located global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

  

risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties we deploy defenses against cyberattack and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques hardware and software typical of companies of our size and scope but there can be no assurance that such defenses and efforts will be sufficient to combat increasingly sophisticated intruders and others who regularly try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems 

we may engage from time to time in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or divest of nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations 

our future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies or enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to complete such transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt or assume lossmaking divisions as consideration we may not be able to complete such transactions for reasons including but not limited to a failure to secure financing any transaction that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including but not limited to the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing divestitures as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt and continue to absorb the costs of lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestiture whether we are able to complete it or not may involve a number of risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with maintaining the business of the targeted divestiture during the disposition process and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring the operations of the business to other facilities 

our offerings or our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties andor that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

  

any claim that our offerings or processes infringe thirdparty intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of the claims merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters if any such claim results in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to 

 in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa and the us occupational safety  health administration and equivalent local state and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material that are included in our offerings and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which no reserves have been recorded we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us we have established accounting reserves for certain contamination liabilities but cannot assure that such liabilities will not exceed our reserves 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we employ approximately 9200  employees worldwide including approximately 3900  employees in north america 3600  in europe 900  in south america and 800  in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all of our european facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environmentslaws our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities collective bargaining or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employmentrelated costs or may result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought 

  

against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make will reduce the cash available for our business or to discharge our financial obligations 

certain of our current and former employees in the us the uk germany france japan and australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2016  the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was approximately 1090 million  primarily related to our pension plans in the uk and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of approximately 393 million  as of june 30 2016  related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated resulting in total obligations related to our pension plans of 1483 million  as of june 30 2016  in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns applicable actuarial assumptions prevailing and expected interest rates and other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness 

  

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business expose us to interestrate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness 

we are highly leveraged as of june 30 2016  we had 17994 million  dollar equivalent of senior indebtedness an additional 1861 million  of unutilized capacity and 139 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 

 our total interest expense net was 885 million  1050 million  and 1631 million  for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloating rate debt an increase of 100 basis points in such rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 69 million  

  

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

  

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of the operating company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply which our credit agreements call restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of crossdefault provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

we may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness and any such instruments may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into interestrate swap agreements or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments may result in economic losses if for example prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixedrate commitment any such swap will expose us to creditrelated risks that if realized could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may change significantly and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile since shares of our common stock were offered for sale in our initial public offering on july 31 2014 through june 30 2016 our common stock price ranged from 1892  to 3442  the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed in “risks related to our business and our industry” and the following 



  

 broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on whether our stockholders choose to hold for the long term 

following periods of market volatility stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses if we become involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future you may not receive any return on your investment in your stock unless you sell it for a net price greater than that which you paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend for the foreseeable future our board of directors has also authorized a stock buyback program that we may use from time to time to purchase our common stock any future decision to pay a dividend and the amount and timing of any future dividend on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend numerous factors including general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future alternative deployments of our cash our future capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock has been affected in part by the research and reports that industry and financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts furthermore if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or our industry change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors or other healthcare sector companies or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the market price of our stock could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

future sales or the perception of future sales of common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

as of august 22 2016  131704 shares of our common stock representing less than 1 of our total outstanding shares of common stock are “restricted securities” within the meaning of the secs rule 144 promulgated under the securities act 

  

“rule 144” and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 

in addition 1423389 shares of common stock may become eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options and restricted share units a total of 6700000  shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2014 omnibus incentive plan of which 3177262 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance at august 22 2016  these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 

pursuant to a registration rights agreement certain holders of restricted shares subject to certain conditions may require us to register or otherwise facilitate the sale under the securities act of their shares of common stock any exercise of their registration rights or any sale by one or more of them of a substantial number of shares could cause the thenprevailing market price of our common stock to decline the shares subject to the registration rights agreement represent approximately 156 of our outstanding shares of common stock 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other equity securities that we wish to issue in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the nyse any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in dilution to you 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

 these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

affiliates of blackstone have substantial influence over us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

affiliates of blackstone beneficially own approximately 137 of our common stock as a result investment funds associated with or designated by affiliates of blackstone have the ability to influence the election of the members of our board of directors and thereby affect our policies and operations including the appointment of management future issuances of our common stock or other securities the payment of dividends if any on our common stock the incurrence or modification of debt by us amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

blackstone is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us for example blackstone has made investments in biomet inc emcure pharmaceuticals ltd apria healthcare group inc nycomed holding as djo global llc independent clinical 

  

services ltd southern cross healthcare group plc stiefel laboratories inc team health holdings inc and vanguard health systems inc 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as blackstone continues to own a significant amount of our combined voting power blackstone will continue to be able to exercise substantial influence over our decisions and so long as blackstone and its affiliates collectively own at least 5 of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors it will be able to appoint individuals to our board of directors under a stockholders agreement the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of the company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock

from time to time we receive subpoenas or requests for information from private parties and various governmental agencies including from state attorneys general and the us department of justice relating to the business practices of customers or suppliers we generally respond to such subpoenas and requests in a timely and thorough manner which responses sometimes require considerable time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us we expect to incur costs in the future in connection with future requests 

during the period november 2015 through april 2016 the primary french drug regulatory agency the “ansm” temporarily suspended operations at the company’s softgel manufacturing facility in beinheim france subject to exemptions for certain types of operations due to the temporary suspension the company was unable to use certain raw materials work in process and finished goods and took a charge of 10 million  net of insurance recoveries during the year ended june 30 2016 in connection with such loss of use and recorded remediation associated costs of 60 million  further certain of the customers of the facility have presented claims against the company for losses they have allegedly suffered due to the temporary suspension or have reserved their right to do so subsequently the company is unable to estimate at this time either the total value of these claims or the likely cost to resolve them changes to the operations at the facility to address the issues leading to the suspension have increased and may in the future additionally increase the cost and therefore decrease the profitability of its operation and may also require the company to incur additional costs

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the “consolidated financial statements” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in regard to significant areas of judgment management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements these estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenues and expenses 

net revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer and animal health customers the majority of our business is conducted through supply or development agreements the majority of our revenue is charged on a priceperunit basis and is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the product or service revenue generated from development arrangements are generally priced by project and are recognized either upon completion of the required service or achievement of a specified project phase or milestone 

  

our overall net revenue is generally affected by the following factors 

 operating expenses 

cost of sales consists of direct costs incurred to manufacture and package products and costs associated with supplying other revenuegenerating services cost of sales includes labor costs for employees involved in the production process and the cost of raw materials and components used in the process or product cost of sales also includes labor costs of employees supporting the production process such as production management quality engineering and other support services other costs in this category include the external research and development costs on behalf of our customers depreciation of fixed assets utility costs freight operating lease expenses and other general manufacturing expenses

 our operating expenses are generally affected by the following factors 



  

allowance for inventory obsolescence 

we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional inventory writedowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 

longlived and other definitelived intangible assets 

we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

   

if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles andor longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on fair value which we derive either by the estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition or on assumptions we believe marketplace participants would utilize and comparable marketplace information in similar arm’s length transactions we then compare weighted values to the asset’s carrying amount any impairment loss recognized would represent the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value significant estimates and judgments are required when estimating such fair values if it is determined that assets are impaired an impairment charge would be recorded and the amount could be material see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with accounting standard codification  “asc” 350  goodwill intangible and other assets  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually utilizing both qualitative and quantitative assessments our annual goodwill impairment test was conducted as of april 1 2016  we assess goodwill for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we determine the fair value of our reporting units utilizing estimated future discounted cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize in addition we use comparative market information and other factors to corroborate the discounted cash flow results no reporting units were at risk of failing step one in the goodwill impairment test under the provisions of asc 350 as of april 1 2016  see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries 

we had valuation allowances of 699 million  and 824 million  as of june 30 2016  and 2015  respectively against our deferred tax assets we considered all available evidence both positive and negative in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluated three possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 



  

 we considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets would be realized based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law the deferred tax liabilities are expected to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to a portion of the deferred tax assets 

during the year ended june 30 2015 we released the majority of our us federal valuation allowance of 1367 million based on projected us future earnings in excess of the 2941 million required to realize its net us federal deferred tax assets of the 2941 million 3295 million relates to the federal net operating loss carryforward nol which expires in the years 2028 to 2032 the remaining 354 million related to other net deferred tax liabilities 

the reversal of the valuation allowance was the result of a continuing trend of us taxable income and the expectation that this trend will continue rather than relying on tax planning strategies to support the realization of deferred tax assets we had experienced three consecutive years of positive us taxable earnings as of june 30 2015 and expect to sustain this position in the future due to the positive impact on us earnings from reduced interest expense resulting from a reduction in our external debt among other factors 

while the us federal valuation allowance was reversed the us state valuation allowance on 3757 million of apportioned state net operating losses was maintained due to uncertainty around earnings apportionment certain restrictions at the state level and the history of tax losses anticipated utilization rates were not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence and allow a release 

asc 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merits we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 

the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution at june 30 2016  and 2015  we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 671 million and 732 million  respectively 

the anticipated future trends included in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets are the same assumptions and anticipated future trends that were incorporated into the estimated fair value of our reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment such assumptions and anticipated future trends were also incorporated into other assessments of our tangible and intangible assets for impairment as applicable we are not currently relying on any taxplanning strategy to support the realization of deferred tax assets 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we adopted accounting standard update asu 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurent on the balance sheet and applied its provisions prospectively without retrospective adjustment 

also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we adopted asu 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income tax expense or benefit in earnings and applied its provision on a modified retrospective basis accordingly we recognized the previously unrecognized excess tax benefits which resulted in a cumulativeeffect tax benefit adjustment of 199 million recorded as part of accumulated deficit with the tax effects recorded as deferred tax assets at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our financial reporting periods operate on a june 30 fiscal year end our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental europe and the united kingdom the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we are able to complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms since january 1 2012 we have completed nine  acquisitions the largest of which was the february 2012 purchase of the aptuit cts business since that acquisition we consolidated three operations including one in december 2012 december 2013 and june 2016 respectively in february 2012 we acquired the remaining 49 ownership interest in our german softgel joint venture we commenced two joint ventures in china in fiscal 2013 and 2014 and completed the acquisition of the partner’s interest in one venture in fiscal 2015 and the other venture in fiscal 2016 we purchased a softgel operation in brazil in fiscal 2014 and have integrated it into our softgel business further in october 2014 the company acquired the remaining shares of redwood bioscience inc “redwood” and its smartag adc technology platform the acquired business is based in the us and is included in the drug delivery solutions segment additionally in november 2014 the company acquired 100 of the shares of mti pharma solutions inc “micron technologies” a company specializing in particle size reduction micronization milling and analytical contract services the acquired business is based in the us and the uk and is included in the drug delivery solutions segment 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenues and costs are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates our operating network is global and as a result our revenues and operating expenses are influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2016  approximately 54  of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the united states much of the revenue generated outside the united states and many of the expenses associated with our operations outside the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar particularly the british pound the euro the brazilian real the argentine peso the japanese yen and the australian dollar changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will affect our revenues and expenses 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the 900 billion annual revenue global pharmaceutical industry including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors and animal health innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market while generic drug share is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of such demand through greater use of generic drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in earlystage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity sustain our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the appointment of strategic partners for important outsourced functions additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have full rd infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations will continue to drive increases in demand for 

both pharmaceutical and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

nongaap performance metrics 

use of ebitda from continuing operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest expense expensebenefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization which is further adjusted for the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests “ebitda from continuing operations” ebitda from continuing operations is not defined under us gaap and is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from continuing operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from continuing operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the consolidated financial statements and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from continuing operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other incomeexpense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expensebenefit and depreciation and amortization “segment ebitda” 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report on form 10k we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap

  percentage not meaningful 

net revenue 

net revenue increased  by 1127 million  or 6  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase in net revenue was driven by increased sales across all three reportable segments led primarily by our softgel technologies segment the increase in net revenue was primarily driven by higher end market volume demand for consumer health products using our softgel offering increased sales volume across our drug delivery solutions segment platforms and increased comparator sourcing volume and increased sales volume related to storage and distribution revenue within our clinical supply services segment revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in volume as a result of the temporary suspension of operations at our softgel manufacturing facility in beinheim france which occurred between november 2015 and april 2016 

gross margin 

gross margin decreased  by 14 million  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by lower volumes resulting in reduced end customer demand of certain higher margin offerings within our drug delivery solutions segment and decreased revenue resulting from the temporary suspension of operations at our softgel manufacturing facility in beinheim france during the period within our softgel technologies segment partially offset by higher sales volumes across all three segments and more effective absorption of fixed costs through higher capacity utilization within our softgel technologies segment on a constant currency basis gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased   200  basis points to 316  in the twelve months ended june 30 2016  as compared to the prior year primarily driven by an unfavorable shift in revenue mix in our drug delivery solutions segment and in our clinical supply services segment 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased  by 303 million  or 9  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to incremental employee compensation costs of approximately 13 million inclusive of certain severance payments inflationary increases and an increase in our noncash equity compensation plans as a result of a change from a cashbased longterm incentive plan to an equitybased longterm 

  

incentive plan selling general and administrative expense also increased due to acquisitionrelated transaction costs of approximately 5 million and increased costs of approximately 6 million related to the temporary suspension of operations at our softgel manufacturing facility in beinheim france from november 2015 to april 2016 selling general and administrative expense increased approximately 5 million because of entities we acquired during the prior year

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 885 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2016   decreased  by 165 million  or 16  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015  primarily driven by lower levels of outstanding debt as compared to the prior year we redeemed 350 million of senior notes due 2018 the senior notes and 275 million of senior subordinated notes due 2017 the senior subordinated notes on august 28 2014 and september 4 2014 respectively in addition we reduced an aggregate of 2345 million of outstanding borrowings under an unsecured term loan during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 partially offset by incremental borrowings of 191 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 in support of completed acquisitions the funds utilized to reduce our debt levels were generated by proceeds from our ipo which was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 

other incomeexpense net 

other income  net of 156 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2016  was primarily driven by noncash net gains from foreign exchange translation recorded during the period plus earnings from our available for sale investments related to our deferred compensation plans other expense net of 424 million  in the twelve months ended june 30 2015  was primarily driven by a sponsor advisory fee agreement termination fee of 298 million which we agreed to pay in connection with our ipo in addition we incurred 218 million of expense in fiscal 2015 associated with the early redemption of our senior notes and prepayment of an unsecured term loan of which 98 million was a cash expense offsetting these other expense items were nonrecurring noncash purchase accounting gains net of 89 million  related to acquisitions completed during the period and 24 million of noncash net gains associated with foreign exchange

softgel technologies’ net revenue increased   557 million  or 7  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the primary driver was higher end market volume demand for lower margin consumer health products using our softgel offering primarily in asia pacific partially offsetting the segments increased revenue was a decrease in volume of prescription products of approximately 35 million primarily in europe due to the temporary suspension of operations at our facility in beinheim france which occurred between november 2015 and april 2016 see below for further discussion 

 softgel technologies’ segment ebitda increased  by 61 million  or 4  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2015  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase was primarily driven by increased sales volumes of our lower margin consumer health products and more effective absorption of fixed costs through higher capacity utilization partially offset by the temporary suspension of operations at our facility in beinheim france resulting in a decrease of approximately 32 million see below for further discussion 

on november 13 2015 the primary french drug regulatory agency the “ansm” issued an order temporarily suspending operations at our softgel manufacturing facility in beinheim france which was lifted on april 28 2016 the suspension order permitted the facility to apply for exemptions for certain types of operations due to the temporary suspension we were unable to use certain raw materials work in process and finished goods and took a charge of 10 million  in fiscal 2016 in connection with such loss of use we recorded remediation associated costs of 60 million  in the same period further certain customers of the facility have presented claims against us for losses they have allegedly suffered due to the temporary suspension or have reserved their right to do so subsequently we are unable to estimate at this time either the total value of these claims or the likely cost to resolve them changes to the operations at the facility to address the issues leading to the suspension have increased and may in the future additionally increase the cost and therefore decrease the profitability of its operation

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations the principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating and capital expenditures business or asset acquisitions and any mandatory or discretionary principal payments on our debt as of june 30 2016  our financing needs were supported by a fiveyear 200 million  revolving credit facility that matures in may 2019 and is reduced by 139 million  in letters of credit the revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline borrowings as of june 30 2016  we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we continue to believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months we have no significant debt maturity until the senior secured term loans mature in may 2021

debt and financing arrangements 

senior secured credit facilities 

on may 20 2014 we entered into the amended and restated credit agreement as amended the credit agreement to provide senior secured financing consisting of a sevenyear 14000 million term loan the “dollar term loan” a sevenyear €2500 million term loan together with the dollar term loan the term loan facilities and a fiveyear 200 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility the proceeds of which were used to prepay in full all outstanding all term loans under our previous senior secured facility the revolving credit facility replaced a prior revolving credit facility and includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as the swing line borrowings   borrowings under the term loan facilities and the revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to a margin over either a a base rate determined by reference to the higher of 1 the rate of interest published by  the wall street journal  as its “prime lending rate” and 2 the federal funds rate plus 1  2  of 1 or b a libor rate determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate set by ice benchmark administration or any successor thereto the applicable margin for the term loan facilities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be reduced if we attain a certain total net leverage ratio the applicable margin for borrowings is 350 for loans based on a libor rate and 250 for loans based on the base rate the libor rate for the term loan facilities is subject to a floor of 100 and the base rate for the term loan facilities is subject to a floor of 200 

on december 1 2014 we entered into amendment no 1 to the credit agreement to provide additional senior secured financing of incremental dollar and euro denominated term loan facilities of 100 million and €728 million 91 million respectively the incremental term loans have substantially similar terms as the term loan facilities under the original version of the credit agreement the proceeds of the borrowing were used during fiscal 2015 primarily to pay the remaining 405 million outstanding on unsecured term loans under the senior unsecured term loan facility entered into on april 29 2013 fund acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 1116 million and general corporate purposes 

 as of june 30 2016  there were 139 million  in outstanding letters of credit which reduced the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 

redemption of notes and unsecured term loan prepayment 

on july 29 2014 we provided notice of our election to redeem the entire 3500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding the senior notes and redeemed them on august 28 2014 at a redemption price of 1015 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest the redemption was funded with proceeds from the ipo 

  

 on august 5 2014 we provided notice of our election to redeem the entire €2250 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of 975 senior subordinated notes due 2017 and redeemed them on september 4 2014 at a redemption price of 101625 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest the redemption was funded with proceeds from the ipo 

on august 6 2014 we repaid 1145 million of the then outstanding borrowings under unsecured term loans with proceeds from the ipo on september 12 2014 we repaid 1200 million of the outstanding borrowings under the unsecured term loans with proceeds from the additional shares purchased by the representatives of the underwriters in connection with the ipo on december 1 2014 we repaid the remaining 405 million then outstanding on the unsecured term loans with proceeds from the incremental term loan facilities 

guarantees and security   

all obligations under the credit agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured by substantially all of the following assets of the company and each guarantor subject to certain exceptions 

 debt covenants 

the credit agreement contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares create liens on assets engage in mergers and consolidations sell assets pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock engage in certain transactions with affiliates make investments loans or advances make certain acquisitions enter into sale and leaseback transactions and change our lines of business 

the credit agreement also contains change of control provisions and certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default the revolving credit facility requires compliance with a net leverage covenant when there is a 30 or more draw outstanding at a period end as of june 30 2016  we were in compliance with all material covenants related to our longterm debt obligations 

subject to certain exceptions our credit agreement permits us and our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness none of our nonus subsidiaries or puerto rico subsidiaries is a guarantor of the loans 

  

liquidity in foreign subsidiaries 

as of june 30 2016  and june 30 2015  the amounts of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were 1291 million  and 1163 million respectively out of the total consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 1316 million  and 1513 million respectively we believe that the amount of funds held by foreign subsidiaries as of such dates not readily convertible into other foreign currencies including us dollars was 59  million and 17 million respectively as of june 30 2016  there is an additional 70 million of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year held by a foreign subsidiary which are classified as other current assets based on our domestic cash flows from operations and our other sources of liquidity we believe we have sufficient access to funds for our expected future domestic liquidity needs our intent is to continue to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign local entities and we do not currently plan to repatriate them to fund our operations in the united states in the event we need to repatriate funds from outside of the united states such repatriation would likely be subject to restrictions by local laws andor tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not feasible to estimate the amount of us tax that might be payable on the remittance of such earnings 

  

historical and adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement the ability of the operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “consolidated ebitda” in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the measure under us gaap most directly comparable to ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda is earningsloss from continuing operations in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are included in the definitions of ebitda from continuing operations and consolidated net income as required in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things 

 

a reconciliation between earnings  loss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda which also shows the adjustments from ebitda from continuing operations follows 





  

 foreign exchange gain of 27 million for the twelve months ended june 30 2015 included 164 million of unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains primarily driven by losses of 314 million related to intercompany loans denominated in a currency different from the functional currency of either the borrower or the lender partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains of 478 million driven by the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge related to the eurodenominated debt the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate losses from the noncash and cash settlement of intercompany loans of 137 million intercompany loans are between our entities and do not reflect the ongoing results of the company’s trade operations 



interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities historically we have used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floating rate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2016  we did not have any interestrate swap agreements in place that would have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans 

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurusd exchange rate on our investments in foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2016  we had 3452 million  of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

periodically we may utilize forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not utilize foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of june 30 2016  



   

 

   

   

   

 

the table excludes our retirement and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations the timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans in fiscal 2017  we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards beyond fiscal 2017  the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans refer to note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the table also excludes approximately 110 million of funded deferred compensation payments owed as of june 30 2016  to certain employees participating in our deferred compensation plan the timing and amount of payments for these obligations are dependent on employee directed distributions withdrawals and employment status as part of the deferred compensation plan we have a corresponding 111 million  of deferred compensation investments as of june 30 2016  which will be used to fund future obligations to the participating employees 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases and letters of credit under the senior secured credit facility we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as of june 30 2016  see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

the company has historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2016  we did not have any interestrate swap agreements in place that would either have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans or would be considered effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products throughout the world our foreign currency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso brazilian real and australian dollar our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars the functional currency of the parent the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss utilizing periodend exchange rates foreign currency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in “other expense net” such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

history 

catalent was formed in april 2007 when affiliates of blackstone acquired the core of the pharmaceutical technologies and services “pts” segment of cardinal health inc “cardinal” cardinal had created pts through a series of acquisitions beginning with rp scherer corporation in 1998 with the intent of creating the world’s leading outsourcing provider of specialized marketleading solutions to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry we are a holding company that indirectly owns catalent pharma solutions inc the operating company which owns directly or indirectly all of our operating subsidiaries since our 2007 acquisition we have regularly reviewed our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan and as a result we have sold five businesses and consolidated operations at four facilities integrating them into the remaining facility network we have also actively acquired new businesses and facilities completing nine  transactions since fiscal 2012 in july 2014 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock the ipo which is now listed on the new york stock exchange the “nyse” under the symbol “ctlt” 

our competitive strengths 

leading provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions 

we are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs biologics and consumer health products in the last decade we have earned revenue with respect to nearly half of the drugs based on new chemical entities “nces” approved by the fda and over the past three years with respect to nearly 80 of the top 200 largestselling compounds globally with approximately 900 scientists and technicians  worldwide and approximately 1300  patents and patent applications our expertise is in providing differentiated technologies and solutions that help our customers bring more products and better treatments to market faster for example in the highvalue area of nces approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us  

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope our large customer base the extensive range of products we produce our broad service offerings and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of a product ’ s lifecycle we produce nearly 7000  distinct items across multiple categories including brand and generic prescription drugs and biologics overthecounter consumer health and veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics in fiscal 2015  our top 20 products represented approximately 20 of total revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of revenue and with no individual product greater than 3 we serve approximately 1000  customers in approximately 80 countries with a majority of our fiscal 2015  revenues coming from outside the united states this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payerdriven pricing pressures experienced by our branded drug and biologic customers 

longstanding extensive relationships with blue chip customers 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2015  we did business with 82 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 19 of the top 20 generics marketers 40 of the top 50 biologics marketers and 23 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with nearly 1000  other customers including emerging and specialty companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs 

we believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers 

  

  

deep broad and growing technology foundation 

our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants within our oral technologies business our leading softgel platforms including liquigels optishell and vegicaps capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family optidose and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory ophthalmic and injectable routes including the blowfillseal unit dose technology advasept glassfree vials and prefilled syringes we also provide advanced biologics formulation options including gene product expression “gpex” cellline and smartag antibodydrug conjugate technologies we have a market leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dose and dry powder inhalers and intranasal forms we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last three years as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications including in fiscal 2015 the addition of particle size engineering technologies for small molecules through our acquisition of micron technologies a recognized market leader in the space our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies our scientists and engineers and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network our global product development team drives a focused application of resources to our highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development as of june 30 2015  we had approximately 700  product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years see “contractual arrangements” for more detail nearly 70 of our fiscal 2015  advanced delivery technology platform revenues comprised of our oral technologies and medication delivery solutions reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage 

  

significant recent growth investments 

we have made significant investments over time to establish a global manufacturing network and today employ 51 million  square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space across five continents we have invested approximately 577 million  in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive ongoing and continuous improvements in safety productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have more than 1100  employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda  with the remaining facilities registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency the “ema” in some cases facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies in fiscal 2015  we underwent 65 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed more than 250 regulatory audits  we also undergo nearly 500 customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a competitive differentiator for catalent 

  

strong and experienced management team 

most of our executive leadership team has been in place since fiscal 2010 today our management team has more than 200 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of more than 20 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships

we intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for development of small molecules biologics and antibodydrug conjugates to formulation and analytical services through early stage clinical development and manufacturing of clinical trials supply to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for latestage trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing expertise that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in appropriate dosage forms the relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life including through potential generic launches or overthecounter “otc” conversion for prescription products we are typically the sole andor exclusive provider and are reflected in customers’ new drug applications 

our breadth of solutions gives us multiple entry points into the lifecycle of our customers’ molecules our initial commercial opportunity arises during the discovery and development of a molecule when our development and particle engineering solutions can be applied once a product reaches latestage development we can provide our customers with drug delivery solutions for the commercialization of their products we have two additional entry points during the commercial phase upon lossofexclusivity and upon otc conversion at these points we partner with the makers and marketers of both generic and otc products to provide them with advanced delivery technologies that can be applied to their products through these stages of the product lifecycle our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of exclusivity may not have a significant negative impact if we continue to work with both branded and generic partners 

an example of this can be found in a leading overthecounter respiratory brand which today uses both our zydis fast dissolve and our liquigels softgel technologies we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription zydis product for six years and we continue to provide the zydis form during the switch to otc status in the united states and other markets in the early 2000s more recently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 24year long relationship across multiple formats and markets 

continue to grow through new product launches and projects 

we intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized advanced delivery technology products with new development programs as of june 30 2015  our product development teams were working on approximately 700  new customer programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our investments since 2010 to expand our global sales and marketing function once developed and approved in the future we expect these programs to add to longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in the year ended june 30 2015  we introduced 165 new products which is in line with new product introductions in the year ended june 30 2014  we also expect that our expanded offerings and capacity such as bioanalytical testing and metered dose inhaler production our acquisition of micron technologies our expanded presence in brazil and our market entry into china will further expand our active advanced delivery technologies development programs and position us for future growth   our development solutions business is driven by thousands of projects annually ranging from individual shortduration analytical projects to multiyear clinical supply programs 

  

accelerate growth with existing customers through increased penetration and broadening of services 

while we have a broad presence across the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries we believe there are significant opportunities for additional revenue growth in our existing customer base by providing advanced delivery solutions for new pipeline or commercial molecules and by expanding the range and depth of our development solutions used by those customers within our top 50 customers nearly 75 use less than half of our individual offerings in order to ensure we provide the most value to our customers we have increased our field sales and marketing force by approximately 20 since fiscal 2009 we have continued to follow a targeted account strategy designating certain accounts as global accounts based on current materiality partnering approach and growth potential we also designate other accounts as growth accounts based primarily on partnering approach and potential to become global accounts in the future in both cases we assign incremental business development product development resources to identify and pursue new opportunities to partner global accounts represented nearly 32  of our revenues in fiscal 2015  while growth accounts represented approximately 9 of revenues in that same period 

enter into and expand into attractive technologies and geographies 

we have made a number of internal investments in new geographies and markets including the construction of a stateoftheart biomanufacturing facility in wisconsin to serve the growing global biologics development market the acquisition of particle engineering provider micron technologies to extend our drug solubility enhancement capabilities and the acquisition of the smartag™ antibodydrug conjugate technology to address the growing need for improved targeted delivery of therapeutic compounds directly to tumor sites 

in addition we intend to increase our presence in emerginghighgrowth geographies and other markets where we are currently only narrowly represented including china brazil japan and the animal health market we have made recent investments in such highgrowth areas including the establishment of the first provider in china of endtoend clinical supply solutions and a softgel facility in china focused initially on the export of costadvantaged consumer health products as well as our acquisition of a brazilian softgel provider in fiscal 2014 

capitalize on our substantial technology platform 

we have a broad and diverse technology platform that is supported by approximately 1300  patents and patent applications in more than 125 families across advanced delivery technologies drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing this platform is supported by substantial knowhow and trade secrets that provide us with additional competitive advantages for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation databases and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us  

in addition to resolving product challenges for our customers’ molecules for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proof of concept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for catalentcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

  

leverage existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our lean six sigma programs a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability we intend to continue to apply this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2009 we have expanded gross margin by over 600 basis points and adjusted ebitda margin by over 400 basis points 

  

pursue strategic acquisitions and licensing to build upon our existing platform 

we operate in highly fragmented markets in both our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions businesses within those markets the five top players represent only 30 and 10 of the total market share respectively by revenue our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets and to generate operating leverage through such acquisitions since fiscal 2012 we have executed nine  transactions investing more than 700 million and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolton acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments we have a dedicated corporate development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions

sales and marketing 

our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and consumer health companies along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices and companies in adjacent industries such as cosmetics we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2015  we did business with 82 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 19 of the top 20 generics marketers 40 of the top 50 biologics marketers and 23 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with nearly 1000  other customers faced with access pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities while reducing their fixed cost base many midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies while facing the same pricing and market pressures have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills technologies and services required to bring their products to market consumer health companies require rapidly developed innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up in the fastpaced overthecounter medication and vitamins markets these market segments are all critically important to our growth but require distinct solutions marketing and sales approaches and market strategy 

we follow a hybrid demand generation organization model with global and growth account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions to selected accounts and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering all business development and field sales representatives ultimately report to a single sales head and significant ongoing investments are made to enhance their skills and capabilities our sales organization currently consists of more than 150  fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings as part of our marketing efforts we participate in major trade shows relevant to the offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and target customers and that our brand identity has become a competitive advantage for us 

  

global accounts 

we manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential by establishing strategic plans goals and targets we recorded approximately 32  of our total revenue in fiscal 2015  from these global accounts each global account is assigned a dedicated business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with the leadership of the sales and marketing function members of the executive leadership team are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship growing sales profitability and increasing account penetration are key goals and are directly linked to compensation account leaders also work closely with the rest of the sales organization to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

  

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other companies to produce their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of customers in the market 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses and quality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice royalties profitsharing and fixed fees we generally secure pricing and contract mechanisms in our supply agreements that allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements provide for our ability to renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials utilized in the products we make our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions in addition our manufacturing supply agreement terms range from three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our oral technologies and medication delivery solutions segments backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our development and clinical services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2015  our backlog was approximately 8276 million as compared to approximately 7821 million  as of june 30 2014  including approximately 4177 million and 3738 million  respectively related to our development and clinical services segment we expect to recognize approximately 77 of revenue from the backlog in existence as of june 30 2015  by the completion of the fiscal year ending june 30 2016  

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world we have thirtyone  facilities on five continents with 51 million  square feet of manufacturing lab and related space our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

  

we operate our plants in accordance with cgmp more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda  with the remaining facilities being registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases certain facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested approximately 3859 million  of cash outflows in our manufacturing facilities since fiscal 2013  through improvements and expansions in our facilities including approximately 1410 million  on capital expenditures in fiscal 2015  we believe that our facilities and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2015  we achieved approximately 98 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for the oral technologies segment packaging films for our development  clinical services segment and resin for our blowfillseal business in our medication delivery solutions segment the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics geopolitical and other issues for example the supply of gelatin is obtained from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability and we have an active and effective supplier audit program we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see “risk factorsrisks relating to our business and industryour future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials” 

competition

risk factors 

tableend if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region we also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these offerings internally where possible 

we face material competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value and speed some competitors may have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customer requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon among other things available resources and their need to develop new products which in turn is dependent upon a number of factors including their competitors’ research development and production initiatives and the anticipated market uptake clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas in addition consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations including research and development departments and their budgets our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers we have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the amount of available policy limits require larger selfinsured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims 

  

we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 25 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability claim or other liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs the eu member states and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning good manufacturing practices and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies including the ema and other various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our offerings for use in our customers’ products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal and foreign regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients which cost could be significant 

in addition any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal and foreign regulatory authorities we or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new products for any number of reasons 

although we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design formulation development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our customers’ products which use our offerings quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution restrictions on our operations or civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such an issue could subject us to costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our medication delivery solutions segment due in part to strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment 

  

malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches requiring the destruction of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation 

our global operations are subject to a number of economic political and regulatory risks 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global competition including potential competition from manufacturers in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain and customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful also fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our consolidated financial results 

  

if we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner our offerings may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of such evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies the patents for these technologies will ultimately expire and these offerings may become subject to competition without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings our offerings may become obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offering portfolios that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements innovations directed at continuing to offer enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations 

the success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

  

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections but these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which will expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur and this may force us to compete with third parties thereby affecting our revenue and profitability we do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any catalent patent 

  

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we have in the past been subject to patent oppositions before the european patent office and we may in the future be subject to patent oppositions in europe or other jurisdictions in which we hold patent rights in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others the outcome of any such legal action may be unfavorable to us 

these legal actions regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld a court might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable in some foreign countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our patent claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered or issued and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks in the past third parties have opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the united states or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

our use of certain intellectual property rights is also subject to license agreements with third parties for certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies if these license agreements were terminated for any reason it could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property our operations may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the united states for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of a challenge to their patents if our customers’ patents were successfully challenged and as a result subjected to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly adversely affected which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings this includes but is not limited to gelatin starch iota carrageenan petroleumbased products and resin also our customers frequently provide their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product it is possible that any of our customer supplier relationships could be interrupted due to 

  

natural disasters international supply disruptions caused by pandemics geopolitical issues and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin is a key component in our oral technologies segment gelatin is available from only a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from bse any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for our customers’ products in the united states or internationally could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our offerings changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations in particular volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar and other foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations 

as a company with many international operations certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including a portion of our senior secured credit facilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currency to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows and could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any efforts we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

  

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we have net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporation’s ability to carryforward its prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its postchange income may be limited we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result if we generate taxable income in future years our ability to use our prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce us federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

we may be required to reestablish a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in the future 

we have deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences we currently do not maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us net deferred tax assets we may experience in the future a decline in us federal taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our us operations an increased level of debt in the us or other factors in assessing our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our us deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we may be required to record a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets which could adversely impact our effective income tax rate 

we are dependent on key personnel 

we depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new enhancements offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel combined with a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on approximately 150 senior employees  to lead and direct the company our senior leadership team “slt” is comprised of our executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market the members of the slt hold positions such as general manager of manufacturing general manager of analytical and development laboratories vice presidentgeneral manager of business unit commercial development director of operations and vice president of quality and regulatory activities 

with respect to our technical talent we have approximately 900 scientists and technicians  whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like morrisville north carolina brussels belgium woodstock illinois madison wisconsin and schorndorf germany global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties 

  

we may in the future engage in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or divest of nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations 

our future success may be dependent on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies and possibly enter into joint ventures that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to acquire targets may also be limited by applicable antitrust laws and other regulations in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions in which we do business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt and assume lossmaking divisions we may not be able to complete such transactions for reasons including but not limited to a failure to secure financing any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities relating to a joint venture of acquired business and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing divestitures as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt and continue to absorb lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestitures that we are unable to complete may involve a number of risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with retaining the targeted divestiture closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring business to other facilities 

our offerings and our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties andor that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary there can be no assurance that we would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we may be found liable for subsequent infringement there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claims that our offerings or processes infringe these rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if such proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to 

 in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa and the us occupational safety  health administration and equivalent local state and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material that are included in our offerings and the disposal of our offerings at the end of their useful life in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which no reserves have been recorded we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us we have established accounting reserves for certain contamination liabilities but cannot assure you that such liabilities will not exceed our reserves 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we employ approximately 8700  employees worldwide including approximately 3600  employees in north america 3500  in europe 900  in south america and 700  in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all of our european facilities consistent with labor environmentslaws in european countries similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist in our plants in argentina brazil and australia our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities or collective bargaining may increase our employmentrelated costs and we may be subject to work stoppages and other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may make will reduce the cash available for our business such as the payment of our interest expense 

certain of our current and former employees in the united states united kingdom germany france japan and australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor as of june 30 2015  the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was approximately 1017 million  primarily related to our fiscal 2012 plans in the united kingdom and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of approximately 395 million  as of june 30 2015  related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we participated resulting in a total underfunded amount related to our pension plans of 1412 million  as of june 30 2015  in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns and a number of other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute to such plans in the future may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on the notes or our other indebtedness 

  

  

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry expose us to interestrate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness 

we are highly leveraged as of june 30 2015  we had 18268 million  dollar equivalent of senior indebtedness an additional 1883 million  of unutilized capacity and 117 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 

 our total interest expense net was 1050 million  1631 million  and 2032 million  for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloating rate debt a 100 basis point increase in such rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 06 million  

  

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

  

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of our subsidiary catalent pharma solutions inc and its restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

 26 

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of cross default provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

we may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variablerate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into payfixed interestrate swaps to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments may result in economic losses should exchange rates decline to a point lower than our fixedrate commitments we will be exposed to creditrelated losses that could adversely affect our results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interestrate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or nonperformance by the counterparties to the interestrate swaps 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may change significantly and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock has been and continues to be volatile since shares of our common stock were offered for sale in our initial public offering on july 31 2014 through june 30 2015 our common stock price ranged from 1985 to 3211 the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed in “risks related to our business and our industry” and the following 

 27 

  

broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on whether our stockholders choose to hold for the long term 

in the past following periods of market volatility stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation if we were involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

we currently intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividend for the foreseeable future the declaration amount and payment of any future dividend on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs possible future favorable deployment of our cash our future capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts furthermore if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry or change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors or other healthcare sector companies or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the company or fails to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

future sales or the perception of future sales of common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

as of september 1 2015  151304 shares of our common stock representing less than 1 of our total outstanding shares of common stock are “restricted securities” within the meaning of rule 144 of the securities act “rule 144” and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 

in addition 1242291 shares of common stock will be eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options a total of 67 million shares of common stock was reserved for issuance under the 2014 omnibus incentive plan of which 4335548 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance at september 1 2015  these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 

pursuant to a registration rights agreement certain holders of restricted shares subject to certain conditions may require us to register or otherwise facilitate the sale under the securities act of their shares of common stock any exercise of their registration rights or any sale by one or more of them of a substantial number of shares could cause the thenprevailing market price of our common stock to decline the shares subject to the registration rights agreement represent approximately 236 of our outstanding common stock 

the market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock that we wish to issue or other securities in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in dilution to you 

  

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear terms 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

 these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

affiliates of blackstone have substantial influence over us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

affiliates of blackstone beneficially own approximately 21 of our common stock as a result investment funds associated with or designated by affiliates of blackstone have the ability to influence the election of the members of our board of directors and thereby affect our policies and operations including the appointment of management future issuances of our common stock or other securities the payment of dividends if any on our common stock the incurrence or modification of debt by us amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you 

blackstone is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us for example blackstone has made investments in biomet inc emcure pharmaceuticals ltd apria healthcare group inc nycomed holding as djo global llc independent clinical services ltd southern cross healthcare group plc stiefel laboratories inc team health holdings inc and vanguard health systems inc 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as blackstone continues to own a significant amount of our combined voting power blackstone will continue to be able to strongly influence our decisions and so long as blackstone and its affiliates collectively own at least 5 of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors it will be able to appoint individuals to our board of directors under a stockholders agreement the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of the company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements the “consolidated financial statements” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in regard to significant areas of judgment management was required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k they also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows 

revenues and expenses 

net revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through supply or development agreements the majority of our revenue is charged on a priceperunit basis and is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the product or service revenue generated from research and development arrangements are generally priced by project and are recognized either upon completion of the required service or achievement of a specified project phase or milestone 

our overall net revenue is generally affected by the following factors 

 40 

  

 operating expenses 

cost of sales consists of direct costs incurred to manufacture and package products and costs associated with supplying other revenuegenerating services cost of sales includes labor costs for employees involved in the production process and the cost of raw materials and components used in the process or product cost of sales also includes labor costs of employees supporting the production process such as production management quality engineering and other support services other costs in this category include the external research and development costs on behalf of our customers depreciation of fixed assets utility costs freight operating lease expenses and other general manufacturing expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative expenses to support our businesses the category includes salaries and related benefit costs of employees supporting our sales and marketing finance human resources information technology and legal functions research and development costs in pursuit of our own proactive development and costs related to executive management other costs in this category include depreciation of fixed assets amortization of our intangible assets professional fees and marketing and other expenses to support selling and administrative areas 

  

direct expenses incurred by a segment are included in that segment’s results shared sales and marketing information technology services and general administrative costs are allocated to each segment based upon the specific activity being performed for each segment or are charged on the basis of the segment’s respective revenues or other applicable measurement certain corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments we do not allocate the following costs to the segments 

 our operating expenses are generally affected by the following factors 

 allowance for inventory obsolescence 

we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional inventory writedowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 

longlived and other definitelived intangible assets 

we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life 

  

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 

   

if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles andor longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on fair value which we derive either by the estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition or on assumptions we believe marketplace participants would utilize and comparable marketplace information in similar arm’s length transactions we then compare weighted values to the asset’s carrying amount any impairment loss recognized would represent the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value significant estimates and judgments are required when estimating such fair values if it is determined that these assets are impaired an impairment charge would be recorded and the amount could be material see note 4  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

goodwill 

we account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with accounting standard codification  “asc” 350  goodwill intangible and other assets  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually utilizing both qualitative and quantitative assessments our annual goodwill impairment test was conducted as of april 1 2015  we assess goodwill for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we determine the fair value of our reporting units utilizing estimated future discounted cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize in addition we use comparative market information and other factors to corroborate the discounted cash flow results no reporting units were at risk of failing step one in the goodwill impairment test under the provisions of asc 350 as of april 1 2015  see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

we may use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rates as a matter of policy we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

as required by  asc 815 derivatives and hedging  asc 815 we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interestrate risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting under asc 815 

  

income taxes 

in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  asc 740 we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these 

  

earnings will be permanently reinvested we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries 

we had valuation allowances of 824 million  and 2182 million  as of june 30 2015  and 2014  respectively against our deferred tax assets we considered all available evidence both positive and negative in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluated three possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets 

• future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 

• tax planning strategies and 

• future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 

we considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets would be realized based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law the deferred tax liabilities are expected to reverse in the same period and jurisdiction and are of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to a portion of the deferred tax assets 

during the year ended june 30 2015  we released the majority of our us federal valuation allowance of 1367 million based on projected us future earnings in excess of the 2941 million required to realize its net us federal deferred tax assets of the 2941 million 3295 million relates to the federal net operating loss carryforward nol which expires in the years 2028 to 2032 the remaining 354 million relates to other net deferred tax liabilities 

the reversal of the valuation allowance was the result of a continuing trend of us taxable income and the expectation that this trend will continue rather than relying on tax planning strategies to support the realization of deferred tax assets we have experienced three consecutive years of positive us taxable earnings as of the current quarter and expect to sustain this position in the future due to the positive impact on us earnings from reduced interest expense resulting from a reduction in our external debt among other factors 

while the us federal valuation allowance was reversed the us state valuation allowance on 4838 million of preapportioned state net operating losses were maintained due to uncertainty around earnings apportionment certain restrictions at the state level and the history of tax losses anticipated utilization rates were not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence and allow a release 

asc 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merits we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 

the calculation of our income tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex domestic and foreign income tax regulations unrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements tax benefits are recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected an unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved a favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution at june 30 2015  and 2014  we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 732 million and 659 million  respectively 

the anticipated future trends included in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets are the same assumptions and anticipated future trends that were incorporated into the estimated fair value of our reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment such assumptions and anticipated future trends were also incorporated into other assessments of our tangible and intangible assets for impairment as applicable we are not currently relying on any taxplanning strategy to support the realization of deferred tax assets 

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements 

  

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our financial reporting periods operate on a june 30 fiscal year end our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in europe and the united kingdom the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we are able to complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms since january 1 2012 we have completed nine  acquisitions the largest of which was the february 2012 purchase of the aptuit cts business since that acquisition we consolidated one operation in december 2012 and completed the consolidation of a second operation in december 2013 in february 2012 we acquired the remaining 49 ownership interest in our german softgel joint venture we commenced two joint ventures in china in fiscal 2013 and 2014 and completed the acquisition of the partner’s interest in one venture in fiscal 2015 we purchased a softgel operation in brazil in fiscal 2014 and have integrated it into our softgel business further in october 2014 the company acquired the remaining shares of redwood bioscience inc “redwood” and its smartag adc technology platform the acquired business is based in the us and is included in the medication delivery solutions segment additionally in november 2014 the company acquired 100 of the shares of mti pharma solutions inc “micron technologies” a company specializing in particle size reduction micronization milling and analytical contract services the acquired business is based in the us and the uk and is included in the development and clinical services segment our efforts to integrate redwood and micron technologies are substantially complete 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenues and costs are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates our operating network is global and as a result our revenues and operating expenses are influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2015  approximately 56  of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the united states much of the revenue generated outside the united states and many of the expenses associated with our operations outside the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar particularly the british pound the euro the brazilian real the argentine peso the japanese yen and the australian dollar changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses 

components of our revenue costs and expenses 

revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through supply or development agreements contractual provisions which may include pricing are sometimes adjusted through arm’slength negotiations with customers in the course of renewing a contract our revenue is charged on a priceperunit or service basis and is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the product or service revenue generated from research and development arrangements are generally priced by project and are recognized either upon completion of the required service or achievement of a specified project phase or milestone the broad capabilities we have to serve our customers provides us limited concentration risk with no customer exceeding 10 and no single product generating more than 3 of revenue 

costs and expenses 

cost of sales consists of direct costs incurred to manufacture products and costs associated with supplying other revenuegenerating services cost of sales includes labor costs for employees involved in the production process and the cost of raw materials and components used in the process or product cost of sales also includes labor costs of employees supporting the production process such as production management quality engineering and other support services other costs in this category include the external research and development costs depreciation of fixed assets used in the manufacturing process utility costs freight operating lease expenses and other general manufacturing expenses 

selling general and administration expenses consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative expenses to support our businesses the category includes salaries and 

  

related benefit costs of employees supporting sales and marketing finance human resources information technology research and development costs and costs related to executive management other costs in this category include depreciation of other fixed assets amortization of our intangible assets professional fees marketing and other expenses to support selling and administrative areas 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the 800 billion annual revenue global pharmaceutical industry including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market while generic drug share is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of such demand through greater use of generic drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in early stage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity sustain our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the appointment of strategic partners for important outsourced functions additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies who less frequently have full rd infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations will continue to drive increases in demand for both pharmaceutical and consumer health products increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for health care treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

nongaap performance metrics 

use of ebitda from continuing operations 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest expense expensebenefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization which is further adjusted for the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests “ebitda from continuing operations” ebitda from continuing operations is not defined under us gaap and is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that disclosing ebitda from continuing operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from continuing operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap 

  

measures our definition of ebitda from continuing operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other incomeexpense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expensebenefit and depreciation and amortization “segment ebitda” 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance in this annual report on form 10k we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap

other incomeexpense net 

other expense  net of 424 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2015  increased from 104 million  in the twelve months ended june 30 2014  the increase was primarily driven by a sponsor advisory fee agreement termination fee of 298 million which we agreed to pay in connection with our ipo in addition we incurred 218 million of expense associated with the early redemption of our senior notes and prepayment of an unsecured term loan of which 98 million was a cash expense offsetting these other expense items were nonrecurring noncash purchase accounting gains net of approximately 89 million  related to acquisitions completed during the period and 24 million of noncash net gains associated with foreign exchange other expense net for the twelve months ended june 30 2014  was primarily driven by expenses of approximately 11 million related to the may 2014 refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees also included were noncash unrealized gains related to foreign currency translation partially offset by realized losses related to foreign currency translation

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations the principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating and capital expenditures business or asset acquisitions interest payments on debt and any mandatory or discretionary principal payments on our debt as of june 30 2015  our financing needs were supported by a fiveyear 200 million  revolving credit facility that matures in may 2019 and is reduced by 117 million  in letters of credit the revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as swingline borrowings as of june 30 2015  we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we continue to believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months we have no significant debt maturity until the senior secured term loans mature in may 2021

debt and financing arrangements 

senior secured credit facilities 

on may 20 2014 we entered into the amended and restated credit agreement to provide senior secured financing consisting of a sevenyear 14000 million term loan the “dollar term loan” a sevenyear €2500 million term loan and a fiveyear 200 million revolving credit facility the proceeds of which were used to prepay in full all outstanding all term loans under its previous senior secured facility a 200 million revolving credit facility replaced the prior facility and includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for shortterm borrowings referred to as the swing line borrowings    borrowings under the term loan facilities and the revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to a margin over either a a base rate determined by reference to the higher of 1 the rate of interest published by  the wall street journal  as its “prime lending rate” and 2 the federal funds rate plus 1  2  of 1 or b a libor rate determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate set by ice benchmark administration or any successor thereto the applicable margin for the term loans and borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be reduced if we attain a certain total net leverage ratio the applicable margin for borrowings is 350 for loans based on a libor rate and 250 for loans based on the base rate the libor rate for term loans is subject to a floor of 100 and the base rate for term loans is subject to a floor of 200 

on december 1 2014 we entered into amendment no 1 to the amended and restated credit agreement as amended the “credit agreement” to provide additional senior secured financing of incremental dollar and euro denominated term loan facilities of 100 million  and €728 million   91 million  respectively the incremental term loans have substantially similar terms as our existing term loan facilities the proceeds of the borrowing were primarily used to pay the remaining 405 million  outstanding on the unsecured term loans fund acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 1116 million  and general corporate purposes 

 as of june 30 2015  there were 117 million  in outstanding letters of credit which reduced the borrowing capacity under the 200 million  revolving credit facility 

redemption of notes and unsecured term loan prepayment 

on july 29 2014 we provided notice of our election to redeem the entire 3500 million  aggregate principal amount outstanding 7875 senior notes due 2018 and redeemed them on august 28 2014 at a redemption price of 1015  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest the redemption was funded with proceeds from the ipo 

 on august 5 2014 we provided notice of its election to redeem the entire €2250 million  aggregate principal amount outstanding of 975 senior subordinated notes due 2017 and redeemed them on september 4 2014 at a redemption price of 101625  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest the redemption was funded with proceeds from the ipo

guarantees and security   

all obligations under the senior secured credit facilities and the guarantees of those obligations are secured by substantially all of the following assets of the company and each guarantor subject to certain exceptions 

 debt covenants 

the credit agreement contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares create liens on assets engage in mergers and consolidations sell assets pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock engage in certain transactions with affiliates make investments loans or advances make certain acquisitions enter into sale and leaseback transactions and change our lines of business 

the credit agreement also contains change of control provisions and certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default the revolving credit facility requires compliance with a net leverage covenant when there is a 30 or more draw outstanding at a period end as of june 30 2015  we were in compliance with all material covenants related to our longterm debt obligations 

subject to certain exceptions our credit agreement permits us and our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness including secured indebtedness none of our nonus subsidiaries or puerto rico subsidiaries is a guarantor of the loans 

  

liquidity in foreign subsidiaries 

as of june 30 2015  and june 30 2014  the amounts of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were 1163 million  and 535 million respectively out of the total consolidated cash and cash equivalents of 1513 million  and 744 million respectively we believe that the amount of funds held by foreign subsidiaries as of such dates not readily convertible into other foreign currencies including us dollars was 17  million and 35 million respectively based on our domestic cash flows from operations and our other sources of liquidity we believe we have sufficient access to funds for our expected future domestic liquidity needs our intent is to continue to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign local entities and we do not currently plan to repatriate them to fund our operations in the united states in the event we need to repatriate funds from outside of the united states such repatriation would likely be subject to restrictions by local laws andor tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not feasible to estimate the amount of us tax that might be payable on the remittance of such earnings 

historical and adjusted ebitda 

under the credit agreement the ability of the operating company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “consolidated ebitda” in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda is a covenant compliance measure in our credit agreement particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments adjusted ebitda is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda is earningsloss from continuing operations in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are included in the definitions of ebitda from continuing operations and consolidated net income as required in the credit agreement adjusted ebitda among other things

a reconciliation between earnings  loss from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda which also shows the adjustments from ebitda from continuing operations follows 



 foreign exchange gain of 35 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2014  included 171 million  of unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains  primarily driven by gains  of 266 million  related to intercompany loans denominated in a currency different from the functional currency of either the borrower or the lender partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses  of 95 million  driven by the ineffective portion of the net investment 

  

hedge related to the eurodenominated debt the foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate losses  from the noncash and cash settlement of intercompany loans of 136 million  intercompany loans are between our entities and do not reflect the ongoing results of the company’s trade operations 

 interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interestrate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixedand floatingrate assets and liabilities historically we have used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floating rate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2015  we did not have any interestrate swap agreements in place that would have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans during fiscal year 2013 our two us dollardenominated and one eurodenominated interestrate swap agreements which were designated as effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes matured our japanese yen interestrate swap effective as an economic hedge but not designated as effective for financial reporting purposes also matured during fiscal 2013 

currency risk management 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the eurusd exchange rate on its investments in foreign operations in europe while we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2015  we had 3558 million  of eurodenominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations refer to note 8  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period 

periodically we may utilize forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not utilize foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of june 30 2015

the table excludes our retirement and other postretirement benefits opeb obligations the timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans in fiscal 2016  we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards beyond fiscal 2016  the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations payments due under our opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans refer to note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases and letters of credit under the senior secured credit facility we do not have any material offbalance sheet arrangements as of june 30 2015  see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to changes in interest rates associated with our longterm debt obligations and foreign exchange rate changes 

interest rate risk 

the company has historically used interestrate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interestrate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2015  we did not have any interestrate swap agreements in place that would either have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floatingrate term loans or would be considered effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes our two us dollardenominated and one eurodenominated interestrate swap agreements which were designated as effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes matured in april 2013 our japanese yen interestrate swap effective as an economic hedge but not designated as effective for financial reporting purposes matured in may 2013 

in february 2013 in connection with the refinancing our €449 million term loan we dedesignated €350 million of the €2400 million notional euriborbased interestrate swap prior to dedesignation the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative was recorded as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss the other comprehensive incomeloss balance associated with the dedesignated portion of the derivative was reclassified to earnings during the second half of fiscal 2013 

foreign currency exchange risk 

by the nature of our global operations we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation these exposures are transactional and translational in nature since we manufacture and sell our products throughout the world our foreign currency risk is diversified principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the european euro british pound argentinean peso brazilian real and australian dollar our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units we also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into us dollars the functional currency of the parent the financial statements of our operations outside the us are measured using the local currency as the functional currency adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations in us dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive incomeloss utilizing periodend exchange rates foreign currency transaction gains and losses calculated by utilizing weighted average exchange rates for the period are included in the statements of operations in “other expense net” such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include intercompany loans denominated in nonus dollar currencies

since 2010 we have made investments to expand our sales and marketing activities leading to growth in the number of active development programs in both strategic platforms for our customers this has further enhanced our extensive longduration relationships and longterm contracts with a broad and diverse range of industryleading customers in the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  we did business with 83 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 19 of the top 20 generics marketers 38 of the top 50 biologics marketers and 24 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  selected key customers include pfizer johnson  johnson glaxosmithkline merck novartis roche actavis and teva we have many longstanding relationships with our customers particularly in advanced delivery technologies where we tend to follow a prescription molecule through all phases of its lifecycle from the original brand prescription development and launch to generics or overthecounter switch a prescription pharmaceutical product relationship with an innovator will often last for nearly two decades extending from midclinical development through the end of the product’s life cycle we serve customers who require innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level 

we believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies intellectual property consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of business and product solutions that can be customized to fit their individual needs today we employ approximately 1000 scientists and technicians and hold approximately 1300 patents and patent applications in advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing the aim of our offerings is to allow our customers to bring more products to market faster and develop and market differentiated new products that improve patient outcomes we believe our leading market position significant global scale and diversity of customers offerings regulatory categories products and geographies reduce our exposure to potential strategic and product shifts within the industry 

we provide a number of proprietary differentiated technologies products and service offerings to our customers across our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions platforms the core technologies within our advanced delivery technologies platform include softgel capsules our zydis oral dissolving tablets blowfillseal unit dose liquids and a range of other oral injectable and respiratory technologies the technologies and service offerings within our development solutions platform span the drug development process ranging from the optiform gpex and smartag platforms for development of small molecules biologics and antibodydrug conjugates or adcs respectively to formulation analytical services early stage clinical development clinical trials supply and regulatory consulting our offerings serve a critical need in the development and manufacturing of difficult to formulate products across a number of product types 

our technologies and services have been assembled over more than 80 years through internal development strategic alliances inlicensing and acquisitions starting with our softgel capsule technology which was initially introduced in the 1930s and has been continuously enhanced we have continued to internally expand our technologies through the introduction of numerous new technologies including launches since fiscal 2013 such as optishell optidose optimelt zydis nano and zydis bio to extend the reach of our technologies and services we have also formed a number of active partnerships including recent partnerships with basf germany cevec germany ctc bio south korea and shangpharma corporation china and have active relationships with research universities around the world we have also augmented our portfolio through five acquisitions over the past three years including significantly expanding the scale of our development and clinical services business through the acquisition of aptuit cts business in 2012 we believe our own internal innovation supplemented by current and future external 

  

partnerships and acquisitions will continue to strengthen and extend our leadership positions in the delivery and development of drugs biologics and consumer health products 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  our revenues were 18277 million  and adjusted ebitda was 4323 million  for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income see “historical and adjusted ebitda” 

  

history 

catalent was formed in april 2007 when we were acquired by affiliates of blackstone prior to that we formed the core of the pharmaceutical technologies and services “pts” segment of cardinal health cardinal pts was in turn created by cardinal through a series of acquisitions with the intent of creating the world’s leading outsourcing provider of specialized marketleading solutions to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in 1998 rp scherer corporation the market leader in advanced oral drug delivery technologies was acquired by cardinal in 1999 cardinal acquired automatic liquid packaging inc the market leader in blowfillseal technology for respiratory treatments ophthalmics and other areas in 2001 cardinal purchased international processing corporation a provider of oral solid dose forms in 2002 pts entered the feeforservice development solutions market with the acquisition of magellan labs a leader in analytical sciences services for the us pharmaceuticals industry finally in 2003 cardinal acquired intercare group plc through which we expanded our european injectable manufacturing network during the period from 1996 through 2006 we also made other selective acquisitions of businesses facilities and technologies in all segments including our legacy pharmaceutical commercial packaging segment 

subsequent to our 2007 acquisition we have regularly reviewed our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan as a result of those ongoing assessments since 2007 we have sold five businesses including two injectable vial facilities in the united states a french oral dose facility a printed components business with four facilities and in fiscal 2012 our north american commercial packaging business we have also consolidated operations at four other facilities integrating them into the remaining facility network since fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2012 we acquired the aptuit cts business combining it into our existing clinical service offerings we also purchased the remaining 49 minority share ownership of our german softgel subsidiary further in calendar 2013 we entered into two joint ventures in china which provided majority control of both a softgel manufacturer and a newly established clinical supply business and acquired a softgel manufacturing business in brazil 

catalent inc formerly known as pts holdings corp is a holding company that has owned pts intermediate holdings llc since our acquisition by blackstone in 2007 pts intermediate holdings llc owns catalent pharma solutions inc which is a holding company that owns directly or indirectly all of our operating subsidiaries 

our competitive strengths 

leading provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions 

we are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs biologics and consumer health products in the last decade we have earned revenue with respect to nearly half of the nce products approved by the fda and over the past three years with respect to 80 of the top 200 largestselling compounds globally with approximately 1000 scientists and technicians worldwide and approximately 1300 patents and patent applications our expertise is in providing differentiated technologies and solutions which help our customers bring more products and better treatments to market faster for example in the high value area of nces approximately 90 of nce softgel approvals by the fda over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us 

diversified operating platform 

we are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope our large customer base the extensive range of products we produce our broad service offerings and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of product lifecycles we produce nearly 7000 distinct items across multiple categories including brand and generic prescription drugs and biologics overthecounter consumer health and veterinary products medical devices and diagnostics in fiscal 2014  our top 20 products represented approximately 25 of total revenue with no single customer accounting for greater than 10 of revenue and with no individual product greater than 3 we serve approximately 1000 customers in approximately 80 countries with a majority of our fiscal 2014  revenues coming from outside the united states this diversity combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships has contributed to the stability of our business it has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic customer and product shifts as well as to payordriven pricing pressures experienced by our branded drug and biologic customers 

  

longstanding extensive relationships with blue chip customers 

we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2014  we did business with 83 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 19 of the top 20 generics marketers 38 of the top 50 biologics marketers and 24 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with nearly a thousand other customers including emerging and specialty companies which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models regardless of size our customers seek innovative product development superior quality advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs we believe our customers value us because our depth of advanced delivery technologies and development services consistent and reliable supply geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions many of which are unavailable from other individual providers 

  

deep broad and growing technology foundation 

our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants within our oral technologies business our leading softgel platforms including liquigels vegicaps and optishell capsules and our modified release technologies including the zydis family osdrc optidose and optimelt technologies provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers we offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory ophthalmic and injectable routes including the blowfillseal unit dose technology and prefilled syringes we also provide advanced biologics formulation options including gene product expression “gpex” cellline and smartag antibodydrug conjugate technologies we have a market leadership position within respiratory delivery including metered dosedry powder inhalers and nasal we have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last three years as we have launched nearly a dozen new technology platforms and applications our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies our scientists and engineers and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network our global research  development team drives focused application of resources to highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development as of june 30 2014  we had more than 450 product development programs in active development across our businesses 

longduration relationships provide sustainability 

our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final dose forms and this generally results in the inclusion of catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings both of these factors translate to longduration supply relationships at an individual product level to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce longduration commercial supply agreements these agreements typically have initial terms of three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years see “contractual arrangements” for more detail nearly 70 of our fiscal 2014  advanced delivery technology platform revenues comprised of our oral technologies and medication delivery solutions reporting segments were covered by such longterm contractual arrangements we believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage 

  

significant recent growth investments 

we have made significant past investments to establish a global manufacturing network and today hold 48 million  square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space across five continents we have invested approximately 5069 million  in the last five fiscal years in capital expenditures growthrelated investments in facilities capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand through our focus on operational quality and regulatory excellence we drive ongoing and continuous improvements in safety productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations which we believe further differentiate us our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality delivery and regulatory compliance expectations 

high standards of regulatory compliance and operational and quality excellence 

we operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” following our own high standards which are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers we have approximately 1000 employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda with the remaining facilities registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency “ema” in some cases facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies in fiscal 2014  we underwent 48 regulatory audits and over the last five fiscal years we successfully completed 239 regulatory audits  we also undergo nearly 500 

  

customer and internal audits annually we believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a competitive differentiator for catalent 

  

strong and experienced management team 

our executive leadership team has been transformed since 2009 with most of the team in place since fiscal 2010 today our management team has more than 200 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries with an average of more than 20 years of functional experience this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships 

our strategy 

we are pursuing the following key growth initiatives 

“follow the molecule” by providing solutions to our customers across all phases of the product lifecycle 

we intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth our development solutions span the drug development process starting with our platforms for development of small molecules biologics and antibodydrug conjugates to formulation and analytical services through early stage clinical development and manufacturing of clinical trials supply to regulatory consulting once a molecule is ready for latestage trials and subsequent commercialization we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing expertise that allow them to deliver their molecules to the endusers in appropriate dosage forms the relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life including through potential generic launches or overthecounter “otc” conversion for prescription products we are typically the sole andor exclusive provider and are reflected in customers’ new drug applications 

our breadth of solutions gives us multiple entry points into the lifecycle of our customers’ molecules our initial commercial opportunity arises during the discovery and development of a molecule when our development solutions can be applied once a product reaches latestage development we can provide our customers with drug delivery solutions for the commercialization of their products we then have two commercial additional entry points upon lossofexclusivity and upon otc conversion at these points we partner with both generic and otc pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide them with advanced delivery technologies that can be applied to their products through these stages of the product lifecycle our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and as a result the loss of exclusivity events may not have a significant negative impact if we continue to work with both branded and generic partners 

an example of this can be found in a leading overthecounter respiratory brand which today uses both our zydis fast dissolve and our liquigels softgel technologies we originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our partner multinational pharmaceutical company in 1992 to address specific patient subsegment needs after four years of development we then commercially supplied the prescription zydis product for six years and continued to provide the zydis form as it switched to otc status in the united states in the early 2000s more recently we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer which the customer elected to develop and launch as well by following this molecule we have built a strong 22year long relationship across multiple formats and markets 

continue to grow through new product launches and projects 

we intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized advanced delivery technology products with new development programs as of june 30 2014  our product development teams were working on approximately 480 new customer programs our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand as well as from our investments since 2010 to expand our global sales and marketing function once developed and approved in the future we expect these programs to add to longduration commercial revenues under longterm contracts and grow our existing product base in the year ended june 30 2014  we introduced 175 new products an increase of more than 80 from the 97 new product introductions in the year ended june 30 2013  we also expect that our expanded offerings and capacity such as bioanalytical testing and metered dose inhaler production our expanded presence in brazil and our market entry into china will further expand our active advanced delivery technologies development programs and position us for future growth   our development solutions business is driven by thousands of projects annually ranging from individual shortduration analytical projects to multiyear clinical supply programs 

  

accelerate growth with existing customers through increased penetration and broadening of services 

while we have a broad presence across the entire biopharmaceutical industry we believe there are significant opportunities for additional revenue growth in our existing customer base by providing advanced delivery solutions for new pipeline or commercial molecules and by expanding the range and depth of development solutions used by those customers within our top 50 customers nearly 75 utilize less than half of our individual offerings in order to ensure we provide the most value to our customers we have increased our field force by approximately 20 since fiscal 2009 we have continued to follow a targeted account strategy designating certain accounts as global accounts based on current materiality partnering approach and growth potential we have also begun to designate other accounts as growth accounts based primarily on partnering approach and potential to become global accounts in the future in both cases we assign incremental business development and research and developmentrd resources to identify and pursue new opportunities to partner global accounts represented nearly 37 of our revenues in fiscal 2014  while growth accounts represented approximately 6 of revenues in that same period 

enter into and expand in attractive technologies and geographies 

we have made a number of internal investments in new geographies and markets including the construction of a stateoftheart biomanufacturing facility in wisconsin to serve the growing global biologics development market and the inlicensing of the smartag antibodydrug conjugate technology to address the growing need for improved targeted delivery of therapeutic compounds directly to tumor sites 

in addition we intend to proactively enter into emerginghighgrowth geographies and other markets where we are currently only narrowly represented including but not limited to china brazil japan and the animal health market we have made recent investments in such highgrowth areas including the formation of a chinabased clinical supplies joint venture with shangpharma corporation the first provider in china of endtoend clinical supply solutions a softgel joint venture in china focused initially on the export of costadvantaged consumer health products as well as our recent acquisition of a brazilian softgel provider 

capitalize on our substantial technology platform 

we have a broad and diverse technology platform that is supported approximately 1300 patents and patent applications in 106 families across advanced delivery technologies drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing this platform is supported by substantial knowhow and trade secrets that provide us with additional competitive advantages for example we have significant softgel fill and formulation databases and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise and as a result more than 90 of nce softgels approved in the last 25 years by the fda have been developed and launched by us 

in addition to resolving product challenges for our customers’ molecules for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proof of concept products whether improved versions of existing drugs new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products in the consumer health area we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for catalentcreated products which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business we expect to continue to seek proactive development and other nontraditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms these activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of endmarket value through outlicensing profitsharing and other arrangements 

  

leverage existing infrastructure and operational discipline to drive profitable growth 

through our existing infrastructure including our global network of operating locations and programs we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion with our lean six sigma programs a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability we intend to continue to apply this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth since fiscal 2009 we have expanded gross margin by over 500 basis points and adjusted ebitda margin by over 300 basis points 

pursue strategic acquisitions and licensing to build upon our existing platform 

we operate in highly fragmented markets in both our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions businesses within those markets the five top players represent only 30 and 10 of the total market share respectively by revenue our broad platform global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets and to generate operating leverage through such acquisitions over the past four fiscal years we have executed five transactions investing more than 570 million and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions 

  

we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolton acquisitions within our existing business areas as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments we have a dedicated business development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating executing and integrating such acquisitions

sales and marketing 

our target customers include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and consumer health companies along with companies in other selected healthcare market segments such as animal health and medical devices we have longstanding extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers in fiscal 2014  we did business with 83 of the top 100 branded drug marketers 19 of the top 20 generics marketers 38 of the top 50 biologics marketers and 24 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally  as well as with nearly a thousand other customers faced with access pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve their rd productivity while reducing their fixed cost base many midsize emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies while facing the same pricing and market pressures have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather to partner with other companiesthrough licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills technologies and services required to bring their products to market consumer health companies require rapidlydeveloped innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up in the fastpaced overthecounter medication and vitamins markets these market segments are all critically important to our growth but require distinct solutions marketing and sales approaches and market strategy 

we follow a hybrid demand generation organization model with global and growth account teams offering the full breadth of catalent’s solutions to selected accounts and technical specialist teams providing the indepth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering all business development and field sales representatives ultimately report to a single sales head and significant ongoing investments are made to enhance their skills and capabilities our sales organization currently consists of more than 150 fulltime experienced sales professionals supported by inside sales and sales operations we also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings supporting these marketing plans we participate in major trade shows relevant to the offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and online advertising and publicity program we believe that since 2009 we have built catalent into a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and target customers and that our brand identity has become a competitive advantage for us 

global accounts 

we manage selected accounts globally due to their materiality and growth potential by establishing strategic plans goals and targets we recorded approximately 37 of our total revenue in fiscal 2014  from these global accounts these accounts are assigned a dedicated business development professional with substantial industry experience these account leaders along with members of the executive leadership team are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship growing sales profitability and increasing account penetration are key goals and are directly linked to compensation account leaders also work closely with the rest of the sales organization to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts 

  

emerging specialty and virtual accounts 

emerging specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be a critical driver of industry growth globally historically many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure but rather partner with other 

  

companies to produce their products we expect them to continue to do so in the future providing a critical source for future integrated solution demand we expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in north america europe south america and asia we regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles funding status and relationships to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of customers in the market 

contractual arrangements 

we generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers including agreements with respect to feasibility development supply licenses and quality the terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as feeforservice royalties profitsharing and fixed fees we generally secure pricing and contract mechanisms in our supply agreements that allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms and in some cases these agreements provide for our ability to renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials utilized in the products we make our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities subject in each case to negotiated exclusions in addition our manufacturing supply agreement terms range from three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods such as 30 or 90 days for our development solutions offerings we may enter into master service agreements which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings 

backlog 

while we generally have longterm supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years our backlog represents as of a point in time future service revenues from work not yet completed for our oral technologies segment and medication delivery solutions segment backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes where applicable for our development and clinical services segment backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts using these methods of reporting backlog as of june 30 2014  backlog was approximately 7821 million as compared to approximately 6483 million as of june 30 2013  including approximately 3738 million and 2726 million respectively related to our development and clinical services segment we expect to recognize approximately 85 of revenue from the backlog in existence as of june 30 2014  by the completion of the fiscal year ending june 30 2015  

to the extent projects are delayed the timing of our revenue could be affected if a customer cancels an order we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred for orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand because of customer ordering patterns our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results 

manufacturing capabilities 

we operate manufacturing facilities development centers and sales offices throughout the world we have twentyseven  facilities on five continents with 48 million  square feet of manufacturing lab and related space our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities including regulatory quality assurance and inhouse validation 

  

we operate our plants in accordance with cgmp more than half of our facilities are registered with the fda with the remaining facilities being registered with other applicable regulatory agencies such as the ema in some cases certain facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies 

we have invested approximately 3491 million  of cash outflows in our manufacturing facilities since fiscal 2012 through improvements and expansions in our facilities including approximately 1224 million  on capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  we believe that our facilities and equipment are in good condition are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future in all material respects 

our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety regulatory compliance operational excellence continuous improvement and process standardization across the organization in fiscal 2014  we achieved approximately 99 ontime shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus our manufacturing operations 

are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs including six sigma and lean manufacturing 

raw materials 

we use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design development and manufacture of our products this includes but is not limited to key materials such as gelatin starch and iota carrageenan for the oral technologies segment packaging films for our development  clinical services segment and resin for our blowfillseal business in our medication delivery solutions segment the raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis globally our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions including those caused by pandemics geopolitical and other issues for example the supply of gelatin is obtained from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from bse any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

we work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability and we have an active and effective supplier audit program we continually evaluate alternate sources of supply although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business see “risk factorsrisks relating to our business and industryour future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials” 

competition 

we compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally including with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies or development services to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america south america europe and the asiapacific region we also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these services internally where possible 

  

competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow where relevant consistency of operational performance quality price value and speed while we do have competitors who compete with us in our individual offerings we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable companies 

research and development costs 

our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements costs incurred in connection with the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses such research and development costs included in selling general and administrative expenses amounted to 175 million  145 million  and 169 million  for fiscal years ended june 30 2014  june 30 2013  and june 30 2012  respectively costs incurred in connection with research and development services we provide to customers and services performed in support of the commercial manufacturing process for customers are recorded within cost of sales such research and development costs included in cost of sales amounted to 340 million  350 million  and 335 million  for fiscal years ended june 30 2014  june 30 2013  and june 30 2012  respectively 

employees 

as of june 30 2014  we had approximately 8300 employees in twentyseven facilities on five continents eight  facilities are in the united states with certain employees at one facility being represented by a labor organization with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all eleven  of our european facilities consistent with labor environmentslaws in european countries similar 

relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist in our plants in argentina brazil and australia our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory 

  



intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings services and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations we operate under licenses from third parties for certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies and in certain instances we license our technology to third parties we also have a long track record of innovation across our lines of business and to further encourage active innovation we have developed incentive compensation systems linked to patent filings and other recognition and reward programs for scientists and nonscientists alike 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered and issued and also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks we hold approximately 1300 patents and patent applications worldwide in advanced drug delivery and biologics formulations and technologies and manufacturing and other areas 

we hold patents and license rights relating to certain aspects of our formulations nutritional and pharmaceutical dosage forms mammalian cell engineering and sterile manufacturing services we also hold patents relating to certain processes and products we have a number of pending patent applications in the united states and certain foreign countries and intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate we have enforced and will continue to enforce our intellectual property rights in the united states and worldwide 

we do not consider any particular patent trademark license franchise or concession to be material to our overall business 

regulatory matters 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of the products of our customers in this industry are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda other government authorities and foreign regulatory authorities certain of our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and will be required to comply with operating and security standards of the drug enforcement agency “dea” the fda the department of health and human services “dhhs” the european union “eu” member states and various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale 

  

in addition certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to the united states federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act the controlled substances act and comparable state and foreign regulations and the needlestick safety and prevention act 

laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of products also exist in most other countries where our subsidiaries conduct business in addition the international manufacturing operations are subject to local certification requirements including compliance with domestic andor foreign good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations established by the fda andor applicable foreign regulatory authorities 

we are also subject to various federal state local foreign and transnational laws regulations and recommendations both in the united states and abroad relating to safe working conditions laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in addition us and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of finished goods raw materials and supplies and the handling of information we are also subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk antibribery act and other antibribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records 

the costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal regulations as well as state local foreign and transnational regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect 

on our results of operations and financial condition see “risk factorsrisks relating to failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations

risk factors 

tableend if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 

risks relating to our business and industry 

we participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business 

we operate in a market that is highly competitive we compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings to pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health companies based in north america latin america europe and the asiapacific region we also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these offerings internally where possible 

we face material competition in each of our markets competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow capabilities consistency of operational performance quality price value and speed some competitors may have greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources than we do competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours expanded competition from companies in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china may in the future impact our results of operations or limit our growth greater financial research and development operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new alternative or emerging technologies changes in the nature or extent of our customer requirements may render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on or are less successful in these activities 

our customers are engaged in research development production and marketing of pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health products the amount of customer spending on research development production and marketing as well as the outcomes of such research development and marketing activities have a large impact on our sales and profitability particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon among other things available resources and their need to develop new products which in turn is dependent upon a number of factors including their competitors’ research development and production initiatives and the anticipated market uptake clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas in addition consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations including research and development departments and their budgets our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources a reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions reimbursement issues or other factors our results of operations may be materially impacted 

we are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

we are subject to significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design development manufacture and marketing of our offerings we may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales significant liabilities and diversion of management’s time attention and resources even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees beginning in 2006 we were named in a number of civil lawsuits relating to the prescription acne medication amnesteem ®  all but one of which have been dismissed or settled without our being required to make any contribution toward any settlement to date we may be named in similar lawsuits in the future see “item 3 legal proceedings” 

furthermore product liability claims and lawsuits regardless of their ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers we have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors the availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries insurance carriers providing product 

  

liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the amount of available policy limits require larger selfinsured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims we maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of 25 million there can be no assurance that a successful product liability claim or other liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations 

failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy state health departments the dhhs the eu member states and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning good manufacturing practices and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies including the ema and other various state boards of pharmacy state health departments andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale 

the manufacture distribution and marketing of our offerings for use in our customers’ products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea the ema and other equivalent local state federal and foreign regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

in addition any new offerings or products must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by the fda the ema and other equivalent local state federal and foreign regulatory authorities we or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new products for any number of reasons 

although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations in addition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation 

our results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects and improving our offerings while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities which relate to the design formulation development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our customers’ products which use our offerings quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions including product recalls product seizures injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations or civil sanctions including monetary sanctions and criminal actions in addition such an issue could subject us to costly litigation including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant 

the services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required our business could suffer 

the offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex particularly in our medication delivery solutions segment due in part to strict regulatory requirements from time to time problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering in both cases for a variety of reasons including but not limited to equipment malfunction sterility variances or failures failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials environmental 

  

factors and damage to or loss of manufacturing operations due to fire flood or similar causes such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches requiring the destruction of product or could halt facility production altogether this could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other batches or products production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred in addition such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation 

our global operations are subject to a number of economic political and regulatory risks 

we conduct our operations in various regions of the world including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways our operations are subject to the effects of global competition including potential competition from manufacturers in lowcost jurisdictions such as india and china local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws our global operations are also affected by local economic environments including inflation and recession political changes some of which may be disruptive can interfere with our supply chain and customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location while some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful also fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our consolidated financial results 

  

if we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner our offerings may become obsolete over time customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline 

the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of such evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies the patents for these technologies will ultimately expire and these offerings may become subject to competition without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings our offerings may become obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer for example if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings our competition may develop offering portfolios that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements innovations directed at continuing to offer enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations 

the success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors including our ability to 

 even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features finally innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or thirdparty reimbursement 

we and our customers depend on patents copyrights trademarks and other forms of intellectual property protections however these protections may not be adequate 

we rely on a combination of knowhow trade secrets patents copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings and intangible assets these proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations there can be no assurance that these protections will 

  

prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents some of which are subject to expire in the near term when patents covering an offering expire loss of exclusivity may occur and this may force us to compete with third parties thereby affecting our revenue and profitability we do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any catalent patent 

  

our proprietary rights may be invalidated circumvented or challenged we have in the past been subject to patent oppositions before the european patent office and we may in the future be subject to patent oppositions in europe or other jurisdictions in which we hold patent rights in addition in the future we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others the outcome of any such legal action may be unfavorable to us 

these legal actions regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will not be breached our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld a court might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement in addition intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable in some foreign countries there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our patent claims to produce competitive offerings the use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business 

we have applied in the united states and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks service marks and patents some of which have been registered or issued and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks in the past third parties have opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the united states or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 

our use of certain intellectual property rights is also subject to license agreements with third parties for certain patents software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies if these license agreements were terminated for any reason it could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property our operations may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to commercialize certain offerings 

in addition many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition because incentives exist in some countries including the united states for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of a challenge to their patents if our customers’ patents were successfully challenged and as a result subjected to generic competition the market for our customers’ products could be significantly impacted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs availability and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture including active pharmaceutical ingredients excipients purchased components and raw materials 

we depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients components compounds raw materials and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings this includes but is not limited to gelatin starch iota carrageenan petroleumbased products and resin also our customers frequently provide their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product it is possible that any of our customer supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters international supply disruptions caused by pandemics geopolitical issues and other events or could be terminated in the future 

for example gelatin is a key component in our oral technologies segment the supply of gelatin is obtained from a limited number of sources in addition much of the gelatin we use is bovinederived past concerns of contamination from bse have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin if there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers we may not be able to obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers if future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovinederived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from bse any such restriction could hinder 

  

our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative nonbovinederived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation testing and regulatory approval 

any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us in addition while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement for our customers’ products in the united states or internationally could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the healthcare industry has changed significantly over time and we expect the industry to continue to evolve some of these changes such as ongoing healthcare reform adverse changes in government or private funding of healthcare products and services legislation or regulations governing the patient access to care and privacy or the delivery pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our offerings changes in the healthcare industry’s pricing selling inventory distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations particularly volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage 

fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar and other foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations 

as a company with many international entities certain revenues costs assets and liabilities including a portion of our senior secured credit facilities and the 975 senior subordinated notes due 2017 the senior subordinated notes are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our revenues earnings and cash flows and could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any efforts we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions including north america south america europe and the asiapacific region as such we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 

we have net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future under section 382 of the code and comparable provisions of state local and foreign tax laws if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period the corporation’s ability to carry forward its prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its postchange income may be limited we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership as a result if we generate taxable income in future years our ability to use our prechange net operating loss carryforwards to reduce us federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations which could result in increased future tax liability to us 

we are dependent on key personnel 

we depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel including our technical personnel to operate and grow our business and to develop new enhancements offerings and technologies the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel combined with a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations 

in addition to our executive officers we rely on the top approximately 150 senior leaders to lead and direct the company our senior leadership team “slt” is comprised of vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized 

  

talents and capabilities which give us a competitive advantage in the market the members of the slt hold positions such as general manager of manufacturing general manager of analytical and development laboratories vice presidentgeneral manager of business unit commercial development director of operations and vice president of quality and regulatory activities 

with respect to our technical talent we have approximately 1000 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like morrisville north carolina brussels belgium woodstock illinois madison wisconsin and schorndorf germany global and regional competitors and in some cases customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do 

risks generally associated with our information systems could adversely affect our results of operations 

we rely on information systems in our business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to 

 our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties 

we may in the future engage in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or divest of nonstrategic businesses or assets we may not be able to complete such transactions and such transactions if executed pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations 

our future success may be dependent on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies and possibly enter into joint ventures that could complement enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities we may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry our ability to acquire targets may also be limited by applicable antitrust laws and other regulations in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions in which we do business to the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt and assume lossmaking divisions we may not be able to complete such transactions for reasons including but not limited to a failure to secure financing any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks including the diversion of management’s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies unexpected liabilities relating to a joint venture of acquired business and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction in addition we may be unable to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies and this may lead to operational inefficiencies 

to the extent that we are not successful in completing divestitures as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash incur debt and continue to absorb lossmaking or underperforming divisions any divestitures that we are unable to complete may involve a number of risks including diversion of management’s attention a negative impact on our customer relationships costs associated with retaining the targeted divestiture closing and disposing of the impacted business or transferring business to other facilities 

our offerings and our customers’ products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 

from time to time third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future while we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties andor that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary there can be no assurance that we would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others patent applications in the united states and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our offerings or processes if patents later issue on these applications we may be found liable for subsequent infringement 

  

there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 

any claims that our offerings or processes infringe these rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers regardless of their merit or resolution could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel we may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation if such proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could among other things be required to 

 in addition our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured and they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology which we may provide 

any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those of the epa and equivalent local state and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate these laws and regulations govern among other things air emissions wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety any failure by us to comply with environmental health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves we are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and noncompliant products the handling of regulated material that are included in our offerings and the disposal of our offerings at the end of their useful life in addition compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes our manufacturing facilities may use in varying degrees hazardous substances in their processes these substances include among others chlorinated solvents and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities including a number we no longer own or operate as at our current facilities contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us in the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at thirdparty locations including facilities we formerly owned or operated the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible we may be required to take additional unplanned remedial measures for which no reserves have been recorded we are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us we have established accounting reserves for certain contamination liabilities but cannot assure you that such liabilities will not exceed our reserves 

we are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future 

we employ approximately 8300  employees worldwide including approximately 3100  employees in north america 3600  in europe 1000  in south america and 600  in the asiapacific region certain employees at one of our north american facilities are represented by a labor organization and national works councils andor labor organizations are active at all twelve of our european facilities consistent with labor environmentslaws in european countries similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist in our plants in argentina brazil and australia our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory however further organizing activities or collective bargaining may increase our employmentrelated 

  

costs and we may be subject to work stoppages and other labor disruptions moreover as employers are subject to various employmentrelated claims such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination wagehour and labor standards issues such actions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our pension plans are underfunded and additional cash contributions we may be required to make will reduce the cash available for our business such as the payment of our interest expense 

certain of our employees in the united states united kingdom germany france japan and australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans which we sponsor as of june 30 2014  the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was approximately 1114 million   primarily related to our fiscal 2012 plans in the united kingdom and germany in addition we have an estimated obligation of approximately 396 million  as of june 30 2014  related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plans in which we participated resulting in a total underfunded amount related to our pension plans of 1510 million as of june 30 2014  in general the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns and a number of other factors and as a result the amount we may be required to contribute to such plans in the future may vary such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on the notes or our other indebtedness 

  

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness 

we are highly leveraged as of june 30 2014  we had 1 17225 million  dollar equivalent of senior indebtedness 2 2939 million  dollar equivalent of senior subordinated notes 3  3487 million  of 7875 senior notes due 2018 the senior notes and 4 2743 million  of senior unsecured term loan in addition we had an additional 1827 million  of unutilized capacity and 173 million  of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 

on august 5 2014  the company completed an initial public offering of 425 million shares of its common stock for an initial price of 2050 per share for total proceeds before underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately 8713 million and proceeds net of underwriters discount and commission and other offering expenses of approximately 8227 million the proceeds raised were used to redeem the outstanding senior subordinated notes redeem the outstanding senior notes and pay a termination fee of 298 million to affiliates of blackstone and certain other existing owners the remaining proceeds were used to repay portions of amounts outstanding under our unsecured term loan facility 

our high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us including 

 our total interest expense net was 1631 million  2032 million  and 1832 million  for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively after taking into consideration our ratio of fixedtofloating rate debt a 100 basis point increase in such rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 24 million 

  

  

despite our high indebtedness level we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 

  

our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 

the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and our new senior secured credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit the ability of our subsidiary catalent pharma solutions inc and its restricted subsidiaries to among other things 

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of cross default provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us 

we may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into payfixed interest rate swaps to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments may result in economic losses should exchange rates decline to a point lower than our fixed rate commitments we will be exposed to creditrelated losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price may change significantly and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile the stock market recently has experienced extreme volatility this volatility often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed in “risks related 

  

to our business and our industry” and the following 

these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance in addition price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low 

in the past following periods of market volatility stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation if we were involved in securities litigation it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation 

because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

we intend to retain future earnings if any for future operations expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future the declaration amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions our financial condition and results of operations our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs capital requirements contractual legal tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant in addition our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur as a result you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business we do not control these analysts furthermore if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry or the stock of any of our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business the price of our stock could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

future sales or the perception of future sales of common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

  

the sale of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

as of september 1 2014 74821337 shares of our common stock representing approximately 64 of our total outstanding shares of common stock will be “restricted securities” within the meaning of rule 144 of the securities act “rule 144” and subject to certain restrictions on resale restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the securities act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as rule 144 

in connection with our initial public offering we our directors and executive officers and holders of substantially all of our common stock immediately prior to our initial public offering agreed with the underwriters of the initial public offering subject to certain exceptions not to dispose of or hedge any of our or their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock for 180 days following the date of the initial public offering prospectus except with the prior written consent of morgan stanley  co llc and jp morgan securities llc 

in addition 2801761 shares of common stock will be eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options we have filed a registration statement on form s8 under the securities act to register all shares of common stock subject to outstanding stock options and the shares of common stock subject to issuance under the 2014 omnibus incentive plan the form s8 registration statement automatically became effective upon filing the initial registration statement on form s8 covered 13192080 shares of common stock these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 

upon the expiration of the lockup agreements described above the remaining restricted shares will be eligible for resale which would be subject to volume manner of sale and other limitations under rule 144 in addition pursuant to a registration rights agreement certain holders of restricted shares subject to certain conditions to require us to register the sale of their shares of our common stock under the securities act by exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares such holders could cause the prevailing market price of our common stock to decline the shares covered by registration rights represent approximately 63 of our outstanding common stock registration of any of these outstanding shares of common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement 

as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities in the future we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions the amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of thenoutstanding shares of our common stock any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in dilution to you 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 

certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay defer or prevent a merger acquisition tender offer takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders 

these provisions provide for among other things 

• a classified board of directors with staggered threeyear 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock 

 27 

  

these antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if the thirdparty’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders as a result our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

affiliates of blackstone control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future 

affiliates of blackstone beneficially own approximately 55  of our common stock as a result investment funds associated with or designated by affiliates of blackstone have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our policies and operations including the appointment of management future issuances of our common stock or other securities the payment of dividends if any on our common stock the incurrence or modification of debt by us amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests in addition blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions divestitures and other transactions that in its judgment could enhance its investment even though such transactions might involve risks to you for example blackstone could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenuegenerating assets additionally in certain circumstances acquisitions of debt at a discount by purchasers that are related to a debtor can give rise to cancellation of indebtedness income to such debtor for us federal income tax purposes 

blackstone is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us for example blackstone has made investments in biomet inc emcure pharmaceuticals ltd apria healthcare group inc nycomed holding as djo global llc independent clinical services ltd southern cross healthcare group plc stiefel laboratories inc team health holdings inc and vanguard health systems inc 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us including any nonemployee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as blackstone continues to own a significant amount of our combined voting power even if such amount is less than 50 blackstone will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions and so long as blackstone and its affiliates collectively own at least 5 of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors it will be able to appoint individuals to our board of directors under a stockholders agreement in addition blackstone is able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of the company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of the company the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of the company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the new york stock exchange and the rules of the sec as a result we qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to stockholders of other companies 

blackstone controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock as a result we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the new york stock exchange under these rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including 

 as a result we are not currently required to have a majority of independent directors our nominatingcorporate governance committee and compensation committee are not currently required to consist entirely of independent directors and such committees are not currently subject to annual performance evaluations accordingly you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange 

  

in addition on june 20 2012 the sec passed final rules implementing provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 pertaining to compensation committee independence and the role and disclosure of compensation consultants and other advisers to the compensation committee the sec’s rules direct each of the national securities exchanges including the new york stock exchange on which we intend to list our common stock to develop listing standards requiring among other things that 

 as a “controlled company” we are not subject to these compensation committee independence requirements

legal proceedings 

tableend beginning in november 2006 we along with several pharmaceutical companies have been named in approximately 380 civil lawsuits these lawsuits were filed by individuals allegedly injured by their use of the prescription acne medication amnesteem ®  a branded generic form of isotretinoin and in some instances of isotretinoin products made andor sold by other firms as well all but one of these lawsuits have been dismissed or settled we were not required to make any contribution toward any settlement to date while it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding including making a determination of liability we believe that we have meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against us and intend to vigorously defend our position 

from time to time we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including without limitation inquiries and claims concerning environmental contamination as well as litigation and allegations in connection with acquisitions product liability manufacturing or packaging defects and claims for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost of which could be significant we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such other litigation and do not currently believe that the outcome of any such other litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in addition the healthcare industry is highly regulated and government agencies continue to scrutinize certain practices affecting government programs and otherwise 

from time to time we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies including from state attorneys general and the us department of justice relating to the business practices of customers or suppliers we generally respond to such subpoenas and requests in a timely and thorough manner which responses sometimes require considerable time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us we expect to incur additional costs in the future in connection with existing and future requests

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in regard to significant areas of judgment management was required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k they also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period actual results could differ from those estimates because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others what follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates 

management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenues and expenses 

net revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through supply or development agreements the majority of our revenue is charged on a priceperunit basis and is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the product or service revenue generated from research and development arrangements are generally priced by project and are recognized either upon completion of the required service or achievement of a specified project phase or milestone 

our overall net revenue is generally impacted by the following factors 

 operational expenses 

cost of sales consists of direct costs incurred to manufacture and package products and costs associated with supplying other revenuegenerating services cost of sales includes labor costs for employees involved in the production process and the cost of raw materials and components used in the process or product cost of sales also includes labor costs of employees supporting the production process such as production management quality engineering and other support services other costs in this 

  

category include the external research and development costs on behalf of our customers depreciation of fixed assets utility costs freight operating lease expenses and other general manufacturing expenses 

selling general and administration expenses consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative expenses to support our businesses the category includes salaries and related benefit costs of employees supporting sales and marketing finance human resources information technology research and development costs in pursuit of our own proactive development and costs related to executive management other costs in this category include depreciation of fixed assets amortization of our intangible assets professional fees marketing and other expenses to support selling and administrative areas 

  

direct expenses incurred by a segment are included in that segment’s results shared sales and marketing information technology services and general administrative costs are allocated to each segment based upon the specific activity being performed for each segment or are charged on the basis of the segment’s respective revenues or other applicable measurement certain corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments we do not allocate the following costs to the segments 

 our operating expenses are generally impacted by the following factors 

 allowance for inventory obsolescence 

we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected additional inventory writedowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 

longlived and other definite lived intangible assets 

we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 

 41 

  

   

if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles andor longlived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we measure any impairment based on fair value which we derive either by the estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition or on assumptions we believe marketplace participants would utilize and comparable marketplace information in similar arm’s length transactions we then compare weighted values to the asset’s carrying amount any impairment loss recognized would represent the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value significant estimates and judgments are required when estimating such fair values if it is determined that these assets are impaired an impairment charge would be recorded and the amount could be material see note 3  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

goodwill 

we account for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with accounting standard codification “asc” 350  goodwill intangible and other assets  under asc 350 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually utilizing both qualitative and quantitative assessments our annual goodwill impairment test was conducted as of april 1 2014  we assess goodwill for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values we determine the fair value of our reporting units utilizing estimated future discounted cash flows and incorporate assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize in addition we use comparative market information and other factors to corroborate the discounted cash flow results no reporting units were at risk of failing step one in the goodwill impairment test under the provisions of asc 350 as of april 1 2014  see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

we use derivative instruments as part of its overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in interest rates as a matter of policy we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

as required by  asc 815 derivatives and hedging  asc 815 we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk such as interest rate risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting under asc 815 

  

income taxes 

in accordance with the provisions of  asc 740 income taxes  asc 740 we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings are permanently reinvested we have not made any provision for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries 

asc 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements elements of this standard also provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as of june 30 2014  we had a total of 657 million of unrecognized tax benefits including accrued interest as applicable

factors affecting our performance 

fluctuations in operating results 

our financial reporting periods operate on a june 30 fiscal year end our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year these fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our and our customers’ annual operational maintenance periods at locations in europe and the united kingdom the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions clinical trial and research and development schedules and to a lesser extent the time of the year some of our customers’ products are in higher demand 

acquisition and related integration efforts 

our growth and profitability are impacted by the acquisitions we are able to complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms since january 1 2012 we have completed five acquisitions the largest of which was the february 2012 purchase of the aptuit cts business since that acquisition we consolidated one operation in december 2012 and recently completed the consolidation of a second operation in december 2013 in addition in february 2012 we acquired the remaining 49 ownership interest in our german softgel joint venture with gelita in pursuit of synergies related to market penetration and cost in february 2012 our more recent joint venture in china commenced in june 2013 and the acquisitions in china and brazil completed in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2014 are progressing as planned 

foreign exchange rates 

significant portions of our revenues and costs are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates our operating network is global and as a result our revenues are influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2014  approximately 63  of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the united states much of the revenue generated outside the united states and many of the expenses associated with our operations outside the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar particularly the british pound the euro the brazilian real the argentine peso the japanese yen and the australian dollar changes in those currencies relative to the us dollar will impact our revenues and expenses exchange rate fluctuations may also affect our compensation and other operating expenses due to foreign currency inflation 

components of our revenue costs and expenses 

revenue 

we sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical biotechnology and consumer health customers the majority of our business is conducted through supply or development agreements contractual provisions which may include pricing are sometimes adjusted through arm’slength negotiations with customers in the course of renewing a contract our revenue is charged on a priceperunit or service basis and is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of the product or service revenue generated from research and development arrangements are generally priced by project and are recognized either upon completion of the required service or achievement of a specified project phase or milestone the broad capabilities we have to serve our customers provides us limited concentration risk with no customer exceeding 10 and no single product generating more than 3 of revenue 

costs and expenses 

cost of sales consists of direct costs incurred to manufacture products and costs associated with supplying other revenuegenerating services cost of sales includes labor costs for employees involved in the production process and the cost of raw materials and components used in the process or product cost of sales also includes labor costs of employees supporting the production process such as production management quality engineering and other support services other costs in this category include the external research and development costs depreciation of fixed assets used in the manufacturing process utility costs freight operating lease expenses and other general manufacturing expenses 

selling general and administration expenses consist of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales and marketing of our products as well as administrative expenses to support our businesses the category includes salaries and related benefit costs of employees supporting sales and marketing finance human resources information technology research and development costs and costs related to executive management other costs in this category include depreciation of other 

  

fixed assets amortization of our intangible assets professional fees marketing and other expenses to support selling and administrative areas 

trends affecting our business 

industry 

we participate in nearly every sector of the 800 billion annual revenue global pharmaceutical industry including but not limited to the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health which includes the overthecounter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market while generic drug share is increasing in both developed and developing markets sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals payors both public and private have sought to limit the economic impact of such demand through greater use of generic drugs access and spending controls and health technology assessment techniques favoring products which deliver truly differentiated outcomes 

new molecule development and rd sourcing 

continued strengthening in early stage development pipelines for drugs and biologics compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity sustain our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their rd resources increasingly involving the appointment of strategic partners for key outsourced functions additionally an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies who less frequently have full rd infrastructure and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners 

demographics 

aging population demographics in developed countries combined with health care reforms in many global markets which are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations will continue to drive increases in demand for both pharmaceutical and consumer health product volumes increasing economic affluence in key developing regions will further increase demand for health care treatments and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these key growth regions and product categories 

finally we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face global supply chain complexity and the increasing demand for improved of treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation improved outcomes and treatment cost reduction all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies 

key performance metrics 

use of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda 

management measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from continuing operations before interest expense expensebenefit for income taxes and depreciation and amortization and is adjusted for the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest “ebitda from continuing operations” ebitda from continuing operations is not defined under us gaap and is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap and is subject to important limitations 

we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and use this measure for business planning purposes in addition given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure we believe that ebitda from continuing operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense we present ebitda from continuing operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of ebitda from continuing operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in addition we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before noncontrolling interest other incomeexpense impairments restructuring costs interest expense income tax expensebenefit and depreciation and amortization “segment ebitda” 

  

under the indentures governing our existing notes the senior unsecured term loan facility and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda which is defined as “ebitda” in the indentures and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility adjusted ebitda is based on the definitions in our indentures and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations we have included the calculations of adjusted ebitda for the periods presented adjusted ebitda is the covenant compliance measure used in certain covenants under the indentures governing the notes and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility particularly those governing debt incurrence and restricted payments because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda is earningsloss from continuing operations for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income see “summarysummary financial data” 

use of constant currency 

as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant periodoverperiod we use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance we calculate constant currency by calculating currentyear results using prioryear foreign currency exchange rates we generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with us gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with us gaap 

fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013    

results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  were as follows 



  percentage not meaningful 

  

net revenue 

net revenue increased  by 290 million  or 2  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased demand for our softgel offering within our oral technologies segment and increased demand in our medication delivery solutions segment partially offset by decreased sales within our modified release technologies business included in oral technologies attributable to the prior year period including approximately 39 million of packaging services related revenue in june 2013 we wound down our uk packaging services operation and no material revenue is included in the current year period 

gross margin 

gross margin increased  by 318 million  or 6  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  on a constant currency basis the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable shift in revenue mix within our medication delivery solutions segment and modified release technologies business within our oral technologies segment as well as increased demand for our softgel offering within our oral technologies segment 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense decreased  by 56 million  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to decreased integration costs related to the acquisition of the aptuit cts business and decreased amortization and depreciation expense partially offset by employee compensation costs driven by inflationary increases 

restructuring and other 

restructuring and other charges of 197 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2014   increased  by 13 million  or 7  compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  the prior period charges primarily related to headcount reduction within our oral technology segment during the twelve months ended june 30 2013  the twelve months ended june 30 2014  included restructuring initiatives across several of our operations which were enacted to improve cost efficiency including the consolidation of our allendale clinical services operation into our philadelphia location and employee related severance expenses 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 1631 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2014   decreased  by 401 million  or 20  compared to twelve months ended june 30 2013  primarily driven by the absence of interest rate swaps in the current period coupled with a lower average interest rate as a result of our debt refinancing activity which occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 

other incomeexpense net 

other expense  net of 104 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2014  decreased from 251 million  in the twelve months ended june 30 2013  other expense net for the twelve months ended june 30 2013  was primarily driven by expenses related to the october 2012 redemption of our senior toggle notes which included expenses related to call premiums paid and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees other expense  net of 104 million  for the twelve months ended june 30 2014  was primarily driven by expenses of approximately 11 million related to the may 2014 refinancing of our senior secured credit facility and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees also included were noncash unrealized gains related to foreign currency translation partially offset by realized losses related to foreign currency translation 

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

our provision  for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2014  was 495 million  relative to earnings  before income taxes of 674 million  our provision  for income taxes for the twelve months ended june 30 2013  was 270 million  relative to losses  before income taxes of 239 million  the income tax provision  for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions and the impact of discrete items generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes in our geographic pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item our effective tax rate at june 30 2014  reflects an increase in a tax reserve related to the potential disallowance of certain tax benefits in the united kingdom partially offset by a deferred tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the united kingdom statutory tax rate during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and benefits derived from operations outside the united states which are generally taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rate of 35

 provided below is a reconciliation of earningsloss from continuing operations to ebitda from continuing operations 

  



oral technologies segment 



oral technologies’ net revenue increased   73 million  or 1  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase is primarily due to favorable demand for our softgel offering of approximately 29 million or 2 as compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 partially offset by decreased sales of approximately 21 million or 2 within our modified release technologies business which was attributable to the prior year period including approximately 39 million of packaging services related revenue in june 2013 we wound down our uk packaging services operation and no material revenue is included in the current year period 

 oral technologies segment ebitda increased  by 126 million  or 4  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase was primarily driven by favorable product mix in both our softgel offering and modified release technologies platform within our oral technologies segment 

medication delivery solutions segment 

net revenue in our medication delivery solutions segment increased  by 212 million  or 10  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  excluding the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to increased demand for injectable products at our european prefilled syringe operations of approximately 15 million or 7 as well as increased demand for products utilizing our blowfillseal technology platform of approximately 7 million or 3 

  

medication delivery solutions segment ebitda increased  by 162 million  or 51  as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  excluding the impact of foreign exchange the increase was primarily attributable to the increased demand for injectable and blowfillseal products as noted above 

development and clinical services segment 



development and clinical services net revenue was level as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  excluding the impact of foreign exchange increased demand from our analytical service operations of approximately 18 million or 5 was offset by lower revenue for manufacturing and packaging services of approximately 18 million or 5 as we consolidated two of our clinical services operations in pursuit of acquisition synergies we experienced revenue declines due to the hesitancy of customers to renew or place new business while we transitioned customer clinical studies we believe such fluctuations to be temporary in nature 

development and clinical services segment ebitda increased  by 65 million  or 9  excluding the impact of foreign exchange as compared to the twelve months ended june 30 2013  primarily due to increased demand for analytical services and favorable revenue mix across the segment partially offset by decreased demand for manufacturing and packaging services 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2012   

results for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  compared to the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  are as follows 



 percentage not meaningful 

net revenue 

net revenue increased 1055 million or 6 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuation of 355 million or 2 net revenue increased by 1410 million or 8 as compared to fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenue from the acquired aptuit cts business within our development and clinical services segment partially offset by volume declines within our zydis technology platform and the impact of reduced revenues from certain customers within our softgel business in our oral technologies segment as a result of switching to lower priced but longer term arrangements 

gross margin 

gross margin increased 100 million or 2 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuation of 106 million or 2 gross margin increased by 206 million or approximately 4 as compared to fiscal 2012 this increase in gross margin was due to the revenue generated by the acquired aptuit cts business within development and clinical services and research and development profit participation revenue recorded within the oral technologies segment these gross margin increases were partially offset by unfavorable product mix and volume declines in the zydis technology platform in our oral technologies segment and within the medication delivery solutions segments 

  

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense decreased 75 million or 2 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 excluding the increase resulting from foreign exchange fluctuation of 34 million or 1 selling general and administrative expense decreased by 41 million as compared to the same period a year ago the decrease was primarily due to the absence of 150 million of transaction related costs associated with the aptuit cts business acquisition which was incurred in fiscal 2012 partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization and integration costs associated with the aptuit cts business acquisition 

  

restructuring and other 

restructuring and other charges decreased 11 million or 6 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the fiscal 2013 charges related to restructuring initiatives across several of our operations which were enacted to improve cost efficiency including both site consolidation and employee related severance charges undertaken to achieve acquisition related synergies the fiscal 2012 charges primarily related to consolidating and streamlining our manufacturing footprint and employee related charges resulting from organizational changes and workforce reductions to adjust the capacity of our workforce within our business units 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of 2032 million increased by 200 million or 11 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily the result of the full twelve month fiscal 2013 effect of the incremental term loan borrowing of 4000 million used to finance the aptuit cts business acquisition which closed during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 during which four months of interest expense was recognized in addition we recorded capital leases in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 for which a full year of interest expense has been incurred in fiscal 2013 compared to only four months in fiscal 2012

other expense of 251 million increased by 289 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the increased expense was primarily driven by both cash and noncash charges associated with financing related fees occurring during fiscal 2013 and by increased noncash unrealized losses related to foreign currency translation on intercompany loans as compared to fiscal 2012 

provisionbenefit for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes was 270 million in fiscal 2013 relative to our loss from continuing operations before income taxes of 239 million resulting in an income tax provision rate in excess of 100 due to the mix of profits and losses in various jurisdictions our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 was 05 million relative to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of 186 million resulting in an income tax provision rate of 27 generally fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes in our geographic pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences restructuring other special items and other discrete tax items which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item key drivers in permanent differences year over year include the reversal of intercompany dividend income which is not included for tax purposes disallowed interest expense as well as a nondeductible asset impairment

 debt covenants 

the credit agreement the senior unsecured term loan facility and the indentures governing the notes contain a number of covenants that among other things restrict subject to certain exceptions the company’s and the company’s restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares create liens on assets engage in mergers and consolidations sell assets pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock repay subordinated indebtedness engage in certain transactions with affiliates make investments loans or advances make certain acquisitions and in the case of the company’s credit agreement enter into sale and leaseback transactions amend material agreements governing the company’s subordinated indebtedness including the senior subordinated notes and change the company’s lines of business

as market conditions warrant and subject to the company’s contractual restrictions and liquidity position we the company’s affiliates andor the company’s major equity holders including blackstone and its affiliates may from time to time repurchase the company’s outstanding debt securities including the notes andor the company’s outstanding bank loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender or otherwise any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt including additional borrowings under the company’s existing credit agreement any new debt may also be secured debt we may also use available cash on the company’s balance sheet the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material further any such purchases may result in the company’s acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of any particular series with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of any such series

foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not feasible to estimate the amount of us tax that might be payable on the remittance of such earnings 

historical and adjusted ebitda 

under the indentures governing the notes and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility the company’s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda is based on the definitions in the company’s indentures and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility is not defined under us gaap and is subject to important limitations we have included the calculations of adjusted ebitda for the period presented below as adjusted ebitda is the covenant compliance measure used in certain covenants under the indentures governing the notes and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility particularly those governing debt incurrence and restricted payments because not all companies use identical calculations the company’s presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

in calculating adjusted ebitda we add back certain noncash nonrecurring and other items that are included in the definitions of ebitda and consolidated net income as required in the credit agreement governing the notes adjusted ebitda among other things 

 the company’s adjusted ebitda for the last twelve months ended june 30 2014  based on the definitions in the company’s indentures and the credit agreement governing the senior unsecured term loan facility is calculated as follows 

  



  

 adjusted net income 

management also measures operating performance based on adjusted net incomeloss adjusted net incomeloss is not defined under us gaap and is not a measure of operating income operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance 

  

with us gaap and is subject to important limitations for example adjusted net income excludes our noncash tax expense and does not reflect the impact on earnings resulting from certain other items 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted net incomeloss enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use this measure for business planning purposes we define adjusted net incomeloss as net earningsloss adjusted for 1 earnings or loss of discontinued operations net of tax 2 tax expense or income which is not cash 3 amortization attributable to purchase accounting and 4 income or loss from noncontrolling interest in our majorityowned operations we also make adjustments for other cash and noncash items included in the table below partially offset by our estimate of the cash taxes saved as a result of such cash and noncash items we believe that adjusted net incomeloss will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations available to our stockholders 

we present adjusted net incomeloss in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and such information is not meant to replace or supersede us gaap measures our definition of adjusted net incomeloss may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 

a reconciliation of net income the most directly comparable us gaap measure to adjusted net income is as follows

interest rate risk management 

a portion of the debt used to finance the company’s operations is exposed to interest rate fluctuations we may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate assets and liabilities historically the company has used interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floating rate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate thereby reducing the impact of future interest rate changes on our future interest expense as of june 30 2014  we did not have any interest rate swap agreements in place that would have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floating rate term loans during fiscal year 2013 our two us dollardenominated and one eurodenominated interest rate swap agreements which were designated as effective cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes matured the companys japanese yen interest rate swap effective as an economic hedge but not designated as effective for financial reporting purposes also matured during fiscal year 2013 

currency risk management 

the company is exposed to fluctuations in the eurusd exchange rate on its investments in foreign operations in europe while the company does not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our european operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros at june 30 2014  the company had 6325 million  of euro denominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations for nonderivatives designated and qualifying as net investment hedges the effective portion of the translation gains or losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss as part of the cumulative translation adjustment for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  the company recorded 136 million  as a loss  within cumulative translation adjustment the net accumulated gain  of this net investment as of june 30 2014  included within other comprehensive incomeloss was approximately 495 million  for the fiscal year ended june 30 2014  the company recognized an unrealized foreign exchange loss  of 96 million  in the consolidated statement of operations related to portion of its eurodenominated debt not designated as a net investment hedge for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013  the company recognized an unrealized foreign exchange loss of 67 million amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated 

periodically we may utilize forward currency exchange contracts to manage the company’s exposures to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs in addition we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities currently we do not utilize foreign currency exchange contracts we expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of june 30 2014

prior to our initial public offering our executive compensation program was determined and approved by the compensation committee of our subsidiary catalent pharma solutions inc in connection with our initial public offering we established a compensation committee that is responsible for establishing maintaining and administering our executive compensation and benefit policies 

except where the context requires otherwise the terms “compensation committee” and “board of directors” as used in this “executive compensation” section refer to the board of directors and compensation committee of catalent pharma solutions inc 

  

over the course of the year our president and chief executive officer provided written assessments of his performance against his specific annual performance goals and objectives to the board of directors at each quarterly meeting of the board of directors the compensation committee took into account the chief executive officer’s recommendations regarding the compensatory arrangements for our executive officers other than himself our president and chief executive officer provided the final compensation recommendations for our named officers neos to the compensation committee for review and approval the other neos do not have any role in determining or recommending the form or amount of compensation paid to our neos our president and chief executive officer was not a member of the compensation committee 

executive compensation program objectives and overview 

our current executive compensation program is intended to achieve two fundamental objectives 1 attract motivate and retain high caliber talent and 2 align executive compensation with achievement of our overall business goals adherence to our core values and stockholder interests in structuring our current executive compensation program we are guided by the following basic philosophies 

competitive compensation   our executive compensation program should provide a fair and competitive compensation opportunity that enables us to attract and retain high caliber executive talent executives should be appropriately rewarded for their contributions to our successful performance 

“ pay for performance  ” a significant portion of each executive’s compensation should be “at risk” and tied to overall company business unit and individual performance 

alignment with stockholder interests   executive compensation should be structured to include variable elements that link executives’ financial rewards to stockholder return the equity portion of each executive’s compensation should be significant 

as described in more detail below the material elements of our executive compensation program for neos include base salary cash bonus opportunities a longterm equity incentive opportunity a deferred compensation opportunity and other retirement benefits and welfare benefits the neos may also receive severance payments and other benefits in connection with certain terminations of employment or a change in control of the company or bhp pts holdings llc we believe that each element of our executive compensation program helps us to achieve one or more of our compensation objectives as illustrated by the table below 

  



these individual compensation elements are intended to create a total compensation package for each neo that we believe achieves our compensation objectives and provides competitive compensation opportunities 

independent compensation consultant 

as described above the compensation committee retained fw cook an independent compensation consulting firm to advise on executive and nonemployee director other than a director employed by the blackstone group compensation in connection with our initial public offering in addition to assisting with the setting of director compensation following our initial public offering fw cook assisted the compensation committee in conducting a review of the competitiveness of our executive compensation program designing our postipo longterm equity incentive award program and determining the size of the initial 

  

longterm equity incentive grants we made and expect to make to certain officers and employees including all of our named executive officers other than mr khichi in connection with our initial public offering 

to assist the compensation committee in its review and evaluation of each of these areas fw cook provided the compensation committee with executive compensation data from a peer group composed of the following 13 companies carefusion corporation covance inc the cooper companies inc charles river laboratories international inc haemonetics corporation hospira inc impax laboratories inc mettlertoledo international inc parexel international corporation perkinelmer inc perrigo company steris corporation and west pharmaceutical services inc the peer group was initially developed by fw cook and was approved by the compensation committee following further refinement based on industry input from management and the compensation committee while the peer group included companies of smaller comparable and larger size our revenue ebitda estimated enterprise value and number of employees approximated the peer group median and our expected market capitalization approximated the 25th percentile of the peer group 

fw cook evaluated the competitiveness of our executive compensation program using both the peer group compensation data as well as a thirdparty pharmaceutical industry survey overall total target annual cash compensation ie base salary plus target bonus for our named executive officers ranged from the median to the 75 th  percentile depending on position and data reference point based on this evaluation fw cook informed the compensation committee that in the aggregate the competitive data did not indicate a need for widespread adjustments to total target annual cash compensation in connection with the initial public offering with respect to our longterm equity incentive opportunities the compensation committee determined to set the total grant value of the initial longterm equity incentive grants for all of our named executive officers other than mr khichi at 100 of each named executive officer’s current base salary which was below the 25 th percentile of the peer group in order to meet our goal of generally setting total compensation for our executive officers at the median of the peer group see “long term equity incentive awards” below for additional details on the initial longterm equity incentive grants

a target annual bonus expressed as a percentage of base salary other than with respect to mr chiminski whose employment agreement provides for a target annual bonus of 1000000 is established within certain neos’ employment agreements or offer letters and may be adjusted from time to time by the compensation committee in connection with an neo’s promotion the target annual bonus for fiscal 2014 for each of the neos other than mr chiminski was 75 of their respective base salary the mip 

  

award which is a cash bonus is tied to our overall financial results the business performance factor and a combination of individual financial andor strategic goals appropriate for each position the individual performance factor 

in fiscal 2012 the compensation committee accepted a recommendation by our senior management to make certain changes to the mip formula for fiscal years beginning with fiscal 2013 the recommendations as they related to the neos were as follows 1 the hurdle point at which the mip pool begins to fund has been raised from 90 of achievement against financial targets to 95 achievement and 2 the preestablished payout percentage scale has been adjusted only with respect to financial performance greater than 105 and up to 110 of financial target achievement for fiscal 2013 the financial performance payout percentages increased by 75 for each 10 increase in specified financial performance target attainment between 105 and 110 achievement of our financial goals previously the specified financial performance payout percentages increased by 50 for each 1 of specified financial performance target attainment as a result of this change in the preestablished scale the maximum financial performance payout percentage attainable at 110 achievement of financial targets was increased from 150 to 1625 the compensation committee accepted the recommendations as a way to more closely align incentive payouts with the achievement of financial targets and to enhance the value created through incremental achievement above financial targets for fiscal 2014 no additional changes to the mip formula were made 

the actual fiscal 2014 mip award for the neos other than mr chiminski was the product of their target annual bonus multiplied by the sum of 1 the business performance factor achievement percentage 20 multiplied by the revenue payout percentage plus 60 multiplied by the internallyadjusted ebitda payout percentage and 2 their individual performance factor achievement percentage 20 multiplied by the individual performance payout percentage the actual fiscal 2014 mip award for the neos other than mr chiminski was capped at 150 of the neos’ target annual bonus for mr chiminski his actual fiscal 2014 mip award was the product of his target annual bonus multiplied by the sum of 1 the business performance factor achievement percentage 25 multiplied by the revenue payout percentage plus 75 multiplied by the internallyadjusted ebitda payout percentage and 2 his individual performance factor and could not exceed 200 of his target annual bonus 

with respect to the neos financial performance is measured 100 at the companywide level financial performance relative to specified financial performance targets set by the board of directors determines the aggregate funding level and the business performance factor for the mip in order for there to be any payment under the mip financial performance with respect to the internallyadjusted ebitda target must meet or exceed 95 of target if the financial performance targets set by the board of directors are met the aggregate bonus pool amount will be set at 100 of the target amount in the annual operating budget and the specified financial performance target payout percentages will be set at 100 subject to the compensation committee’s discretion if financial performance exceeds the targets the aggregate bonus pool amount and the specified financial performance target payout percentages are increased above 100 up to a maximum of 1625 based on a preestablished scale if financial performance does not meet target the bonus pool amount and the specified financial performance target payout percentages are decreased from 100 based on the preestablished scale pursuant to the preestablished scale each 1 change in the specified financial performance results in relation to the target amount equates to a 5 change in the applicable financial performance payout percentages when the financial performance is 95 or greater up to 105 for financial performance target attainment above 105 and up to 110 the change in financial performance payout percentage is 75 for example exceeding the financial performance target by 6 equates to a payout percentage of 1325 and financial performance at 95 of the specified financial performance target equates to a payout percentage of 75 the compensation committee has the discretion to adjust the mip aggregate bonus pool amount and the business performance factor determined by reference to the preestablished scale upwards or downwards to address special situations 

we believe that tying the neos’ bonuses to companywide performance goals encourages collaboration across the executive leadership team we attempt to establish the financial performance targets at challenging levels that are reasonably attainable if we meet our performance objectives for fiscal 2014 we used internallyadjusted ebitda and revenue as measures of financial performance because we believe that they provide a reliable indicator of our strategic growth and the strength of our cash flow and overall financial results internallyadjusted ebitda is generally calculated in the same manner as adjusted ebitda is calculated for purposes of the indentures governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured term loan facility except for the impact of foreign exchange and other nonoperational matters in determining the actual business performance factor the achievement of internallyadjusted ebitda against target is weighted 75 while the achievement of revenue against target is weighted 25 the fiscal 2014 internallyadjusted ebitda performance target was 4538 million and our actual internallyadjusted ebitda performance for fiscal 2014 was 4357 million the fiscal 2014 revenue performance goal was 191 billion and our revenue performance for fiscal 2014 was 183 billion based on this financial performance and pursuant to the preestablished scale the internallyadjusted ebitda payout percentage was 80 and the revenue payout percentage was also 80 which therefore resulted in a business performance achievement percentage of 80 for mr chiminski and 64 for messrs walsh downie and leonard the business performance factor determines the funding for 80 of the mip pool 

  

after setting the business performance factor the compensation committee determines the actual bonuses paid to the neos based on an assessment of each neo’s individual performance factor other than with respect to mr chiminski the individual performance factor payout percentage which only impacts 20 of an neo’s mip award can range from 0 to 150 mr chiminski’s individual performance factor which is not weighted and impacts his entire mip award can range from 0 to 100 and is based on the compensation committee’s overall assessment of his individual performance based on the achievement of his personal strategic and financial objectives that are set at the beginning of the fiscal year for fiscal 2014 mr chiminski’s individual goals and objectives for his individual performance factor related to the following five areas and were assigned the following weightings revenue and strategic growth initiatives 40 inorganic growth initiatives 25 cash management and margin objectives 10 operational excellencequality compliance objectives 10 and chief executive officer leadership and organization vitality objectives 15 the fiscal 2014 goals and objectives for the other neos related to the following five categories but were not assigned numerical weightings quality and compliance operational excellence customer innovationgrowth organizational vitalityleadership and financial accountability each fiscal year the neos typically have between twenty and thirty individual goals and objectives established within the broader categories 

the compensation committee performed the assessment of mr chiminski’s individual performance factor after reviewing the written assessments of his performance against his specific goals and objectives that mr chiminski provided at each quarterly meeting of the board of directors the chief executive officer together with the senior vice president human resources performed the assessment of the other neos’ individual performance factors and made a recommendation to the compensation committee 

the following table illustrates the calculation of the fiscal 2014 mip award earned by each of our neos other than mr khichi as further described in the “severance and other benefits” section below mr khichi resigned from the company effective july 15 2014 since mr khichi’s resignation was effective prior to the company’s payment of the fiscal 2014 mip awards he was not eligible to receive a mip award for fiscal 2014 actual fiscal 2014 mip awards are also presented in the summary compensation table below 

  



signon bonuses 

from time to time our compensation committee may award signon bonuses in connection with the commencement of an neo’s employment with us signon bonuses are used only when necessary to attract highly skilled officers to the company generally they are used to incentivize candidates to leave their current employers or may be used to offset the loss of unvested compensation they may forfeit as a result of leaving their current employers signon bonuses are typically subject to a clawback obligation if the officer voluntarily terminates his employment with us within twelve months of the employment commencement date 

discretionary bonuses 

from time to time our compensation committee may award discretionary bonuses in addition to any annual bonus payable under the mip in recognition of extraordinary performance for fiscal 2014 our compensation committee awarded mr leonard a discretionary bonus of 50000 in recognition of his superior performance in fiscal 2014 this discretionary bonus amount is reported in the “bonus” column in the summary compensation table below   

in fiscal 2015 in recognition of their significant efforts in executing the company’s successful initial public offering our compensation committee determined to award messrs chiminski and walsh special ipo bonuses of 500000 and 200000 respectively since these amounts were not earned until the closing of our initial public offering in fiscal 2015 they will be reported in the “bonus” column in next year’s summary compensation table 

  

longterm equity incentive awards 

we believe that the neos’ longterm compensation should be directly linked to the value we deliver to our stockholders equity awards to the neos are designed to provide longterm incentive opportunities over a period of several years stock options have historically been our preferred equity award because the options will not have any value unless the underlying shares of common stock appreciate in value following the grant date accordingly awarding stock options causes more compensation to be “at risk” and further aligns our executive compensation with our long term profitability and the creation of shareholder value the 2007 pts holdings corp stock incentive plan also permitted us to grant other types of equitybased awards such as restricted stock units stock appreciation rights restricted stock and other “full value” awards for example we have granted restricted stock units “rsus” to messrs chiminski and walsh see “description of equitybased awards” below to further align their interests with those of our stockholders 

another key component of our longterm equity incentive program prior to our initial public offering was that neos and other eligible employees were provided with the opportunity to invest in our common stock on the same general terms as our existing owners we considered this investment opportunity an important part of our equity program because it encouraged stock ownership and aligned the neos’ financial interests with those of our stockholders 

  

the amounts of each neo’s investment opportunity and stock option andor rsu award as applicable were determined based on several factors including 1 each neo’s position and expected contribution to our future growth 2 dilution effects on our stockholders and the need to maintain the availability of an appropriate number of shares for option awards to lesssenior employees and 3 ensuring that the neos were provided with appropriate and competitive total longterm equity compensation and total compensation amounts 

generally options were granted to senior level officers based on their position in the company historically grants have not been made on an annual basis and instead were made upon an executive’s commencement of employment with us or when an executive receives promotions into more senior level positions 

in may 2014 for retention purposes our board of directors granted mr walsh an additional 29400 restricted stock units in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the 2007 pts holdings corp stock incentive plan as amended from time to time subject to mr walsh’s continued employment 100 of the restricted stock units will vest on may 7 2016 there were no other longterm equity incentive awards granted to the neos in fiscal 2014 see “description of equitybased awards” below for additional details 

new longterm equity incentive program 

in connection with our initial public offering with the assistance of fw cook our compensation committee approved a new longterm equity incentive program which is expected to commence in fiscal 2016 after reviewing peer group market data provided by fw cook the compensation committee has determined to adopt a portfolio approach of annual grants with a valuebased mix of performance share units timebased stock options and timebased rsus with 50 30 and 20 weightings respectively this new program is consistent with the peer group and broader public company practice and is consistent with our compensation objective of providing a longterm equity incentive opportunity that aligns compensation with the creation of sustainable stockholder value and achievement of business goals awards under this new program will reflect market based compensation subject to the discretion of our compensation committee and will be granted during our standard performance evaluation and compensation planning calendar following the end of each applicable fiscal year 

fiscal 2015 awards 

in connection with our initial public offering we also made initial longterm equity incentive grants under our 2014 omnibus incentive plan to certain officers and employees including all of our named executive officers other than mr khichi which were structured the same way as the annual grants we expect to commence in fiscal 2016 and provide a mix of performance share units timebased stock options and timebased restricted stock units with the same 50 30 and 20 valuebased weightings described above subject to the recipient’s continued service with the company through each applicable vesting date onefourth of the shares subject to stock options will vest on each oneyear anniversary following our initial public offering and the restricted stock units will be fully vested on the third anniversary of our initial public offering 

on a “change in control” any outstanding and unvested timebased stock options and restricted stock units will become fully vested to the extent the acquiring or successor entity does not assume continue or substitute for the stock options and restricted stock units if the recipient’s employment is terminated by us without cause within eighteen 18 months following a “change in control” any outstanding and unvested stock options and restricted stock units will become fully vested to the extent the acquiring 

  

or successor entity assumes continues or substitutes for the stock options and restricted stock units any outstanding and unvested stock options and restricted stock units will continue to vest on the originally scheduled vesting dates subject to continued compliance with postemployment restrictive covenants through the originally scheduled vesting dates and the recipient executing a release of claims in the event of the recipient’s termination of employment by the recipient due to retirement or due to disability any outstanding and unvested stock options and restricted stock units will become fully vested in the event of the recipient’s termination of employment due to the recipient’s death upon any other termination of employment all unvested stock options and restricted stock units will be forfeited 

performance share units were granted on september 3 2014 and subject to the recipient’s continued service with the company through the vesting date are scheduled to vest following the end of the three year performance period which began on july 1 2014 and is scheduled to end on june 30 2017 based on cumulative revenue growth relative to our revenue for fiscal 2014 which represents 25 of the goals as of the last day of the performance period plus cumulative ebitda growth relative to our adjusted ebitda for fiscal 2014 which represents 75 of the goals as of the last day of the three year performance period with revenue and ebitda as defined in the award agreement depending on the level of growth achieved the number of performance share units which may vest at the end of the performance period will range from 0 for below threshold performance up to 200 for maximum performance 

the value of the award was translated into a number of performance share units by dividing the value of the grant by the closing price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 

in the event of a “change in control” on or prior to july 1 2015 to the extent the acquiring or successor entity does not assume continue or substitute for the performance share units the target number of performance share units will become fully vested in the event of a “change in control” after july 1 2015 but prior to june 30 2017 to the extent the acquiring or successor entity does not assume continue or substitute for the performance share units a number of performance share units equal to the number that would have vested based on actual growth between july 1 2014 and the last day of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of the “change in control” assuming that the performance period ends on such date and measuring cumulative growth as of such date will become fully vested and any remaining performance share units will be forfeited 

in the event of a “change in control” on or prior to july 1 2015 to the extent the acquiring or successor entity assumes continues or substitutes for the performance share units the target number of performance share units will convert into timebased restricted stock units which will vest on june 30 2017 subject to the recipient’s continued employment through the vesting date in the event of a “change in control” after july 1 2015 but prior to june 30 2017 to the extent the acquiring or successor entity assumes continues or substitutes for the performance share units the number of performance share units that will convert into timebased restricted stock units will be equal to the number of performance share units that would have vested based on actual growth between july 1 2014 and the last day of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of the “change in control” assuming that the performance period ends on such date and measuring cumulative growth as of such date and any remaining performance share units will be forfeited 

  

in the event of the recipient’s termination of employment due to disability or retirement the performance share units will remain outstanding through the end of the performance period and the performance share units will vest based on actual performance during the performance period subject to continued compliance with postemployment restrictive covenants through the originally scheduled vesting date and the recipient executing a release of claims unless a “change in control” occurs in which case the performance share units will be treated as described above however in the case of the recipient’s retirement the number of performance share units that vest if any will be prorated based on the time elapsed as of the date of termination in the event of the recipient’s termination of employment due to the recipient’s death the target number of performance share units will become fully vested unless a “change in control” occurs prior to such date in which case the resulting number of performance share units as determined as described above will vest if the recipient’s employment is terminated by us without cause within eighteen 18 months following a “change in control” any outstanding and unvested converted restricted stock units will become fully vested upon any other termination of employment all unvested performance share units or converted restricted stock units as applicable will be forfeited 

the award agreement for each of the foregoing initial longterm equity incentive grants contains restrictive covenants provided that if the recipient is party to an employment or similar agreement which already contains restrictive covenants then the existing restrictive covenants will continue to apply in lieu of the restrictive covenants contained in the award agreement under the award agreements while employed and for one year following their termination of employment recipients are prohibited from competing with us and from soliciting our employees consultants and certain actual and prospective clients the award agreement also contains an indefinite restriction on the recipient’s disclosure of our confidential information if a recipient breaches 

  

any of these restrictive covenants or the company determines after termination that grounds for a termination for cause existed we have the right to “clawback” and recover any gains the recipient may have realized with respect to his or her awards or any shares issued in respect thereof   

the following table illustrates the total grant value of the above described initial long term incentive grants for each of our named executive officers other than mr khichi which was translated into the number of performance share units assuming that the target level of performance is achieved with the actual number of shares to be earned based on the performance criteria described above stock options and restricted stock units set forth below by taking such dollar amount and dividing it by the per share “fair value” used for reporting the compensation expense associated with the grant under applicable accounting guidance 

  

 deferred compensation opportunity and other retirement benefits 

catalent pharma solutions llc deferred compensation plan 

our neos are eligible to participate in our 401k plan and our nonqualified deferred compensation plan the nonqualified deferred compensation plan generally allows participants to defer on a pretax basis up to 20 of their base salaries and 100 of their annual cash bonuses we believe that providing the neos with deferred compensation opportunities is a market based benefit plan necessary for us to deliver competitive benefit packages this plan allows its participants to receive the tax benefits associated with delaying the income tax event on the compensation deferred even though our related deduction is also deferred the nonqualified deferred compensation plan also provides for three types of discretionary company contributions to supplement the amounts deferred by the neos and other eligible employees subject to certain limits in january 2009 we elected to suspend our employer nonmatching contributions and in february 2009 we elected to suspend our employer matching contribution effective february 1 2010 we reinstated our employer matching contribution based on the strength of our financial results however we did not reinstate the other employer contributions we currently match 50 of the first 6 of eligible pay that employees contribute to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan up to the first 100000 above the irs qualified plan limits the nonqualified deferred compensationfiscal 2014 table and related narrative section below describe our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and the benefits it provides 

chiminski rsu bonus election obligation to purchase common stock 

pursuant to the terms of mr chiminski’s employment agreement in addition to the shares of our common stock that he has already purchased mr chiminski was required to use 50 of the aftertax proceeds of any payment he received as an annual mip bonus while employed paid in respect of fiscal 2010 or 2011 in each case to promptly purchase shares of our common stock 

on june 30 2010 we catalent pharma solutions inc and mr chiminski entered into a letter agreement which modified certain terms of mr chiminski’s employment agreement the primary purpose of the letter agreement was to provide mr chiminski with a more taxadvantaged mechanism to satisfy his employment agreement obligation to purchase additional shares of our common stock specifically the letter agreement permits mr chiminski to irrevocably elect on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each fiscal year commencing with fiscal 2011 in lieu of receiving a portion of his annual mip bonus in cash to receive a grant of fully vested rsus to be settled in shares of our common stock which rsus will be granted on the bonus payment date mr chiminski made such an election for fiscal 2011 and received 50 of his annual mip bonus in respect of such fiscal year in the form of a grant of rsus for elections in respect of any fiscal year after fiscal 2011 mr chiminski may elect to receive no less than 20 of his annual mip bonus if any in the form of a grant of rsus the number of rsus mr chiminski receives will be based on the value of the portion of the annual mip bonus he elects to defer into rsus and the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the bonus payment date for each of fiscal 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 mr chiminski did not elect to receive fully vested rsus in lieu of a portion of his annual mip bonus 

  

all grants made in connection with an annual mip bonus election will be subject to a separate rsu agreement which provides that the rsus will be 100 vested on the date of grant which will be the bonus payment date and will be settled in shares of our common stock on the earlier to occur of a change in control of the company or bhp pts holdings llc and the sixth anniversary of the date of grant 

other retirement benefits 

in addition to our 401k plan and nonqualified deferred compensation plan we have three frozen definedbenefit pension plans these pension plans were originally established by rp scherer corporation and its affiliates which was a predecessor corporation that was acquired by cardinal health in connection with the acquisition we agreed with cardinal health to assume liability for benefits provided under these pension plans subject to receiving certain asset transfers from cardinal health and its benefit plans all three plans are currently closed to new participants and frozen with respect to benefit accruals none of the neos are currently eligible to participate in the frozen definedbenefit pension plans in connection with his relocation to the united states we agreed to permit mr downie’s continued his participation in the catalent pharma solutions uk pension plan the catalent pharma solutions uk pension plan is a defined contribution plan open to all employees of our catalent pharma solutions limited uk entity the plan provides for an employer matching contribution of between 5 and 8 of eligible base salary compensation dependent upon the participant contributing between 3 and 6 of eligible base salary compensation 

severance and other benefits 

we believe that severance protections can play a valuable role in attracting and retaining high caliber talent in the competitive market for executive talent we believe severance payments and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to offset the risk of foregoing an opportunity with another company for example we offer each neo an enhanced outplacement benefit consistent with our objective of using severance payments and benefits to attract and retain executives we generally provide each neo with amounts and types of severance payments and benefits that we believe will permit us to attract andor continue to employ the individual neo 

the severance benefits under these agreements are generally more favorable than the benefits payable under our general severance policy for example we offer each neo a severance benefit payable upon a termination by the neo for good reason or by us without cause the good reason definition in these agreements would only be triggered by adverse circumstances that we believe would give rise to a constructive termination of employment 

at our discretion we may also provide certain executives with enhancements to our existing benefits that are not available to other employees such as relocation assistance as part of mr chiminski’s amended employment contract he is eligible to receive reimbursement on a tax grossedup basis on an annual basis during each calendar year of the employment term for the reasonable cost of 1 premiums for an executive life insurance policy not to exceed 15000 and 2 financial servicesplanning not to exceed 15000

section 162m of the internal revenue code 

following our initial public offering we expect to be able to claim the benefit of a special exemption rule that applies to compensation paid or compensation in respect of equity awards such as stock options or restricted stock granted during a specified transition period this transition period may extend until the first annual stockholders meeting that occurs after the close of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which our initial public offering occurred unless the transition period is terminated earlier under the section 162m postoffering transition rules at such time as we are subject to the deduction limitations of section 162m we expect that the compensation committee will take the deductibility limitations of section 162m into account in its compensation decisions however the compensation committee may in its judgment authorize compensation payments that are not exempt under section 162m when it believes that such payments are appropriate to attract or retain talent

description of equitybased awards 

effective june 25 2013 our board of directors approved a new option grant framework pursuant to which employees who are holders of options to purchase our common stock would be eligible for new biennial option awards beginning on the fourth anniversary of the date of their original option grant in connection with the adoption of the new option grant framework on june 25 2013 our board of directors granted new option awards to each of our named officers we do not intend to make any further grants under the new option framework as a result of our initial public offering 

the options granted under the new framework were divided into two tranches for vesting purposes onehalf of the options are subject to performancebased vesting restrictions and onehalf of the options are subject to exit eventbased vesting restrictions the performancebased options will vest and become exercisable with respect to 20 of the options subject to performancebased vesting on each of the first five anniversaries of the applicable vesting reference date if we achieve specified ebitda performance targets subject to a cumulative catchup the ebitda performance targets were established at levels that are reasonably attainable 

  

but challenging to achieve fiscal 2014 budgeted ebitda serves as the base line target for the first fiscal year in the vesting schedule and the targets for the remaining four fiscal years of the vesting schedule are based on eight percent 8 year over year increases thereafter the exit eventbased options will vest and become exercisable on the date if any when the blackstone group will have received cash proceeds or marketable securities from the sale of its investment in us aggregating in excess of 20 times the amount of its initial investment in us vesting under both the performancebased options and the exit eventbased options is generally subject to continued employment with us through the applicable vesting dates in addition in the event of a change of control as defined in the 2007 pts holdings corp stock incentive plan or the option agreement as applicable in which the exit eventbased options vest any outstanding unvested performancebased options will also vest all other terms of the options granted under the new option framework including any continued vesting following termination are substantially similar to the terms of the option holder’s existing options the material terms of which are described below

options which remain outstanding will be immediately forfeited without consideration as of the termination date however in the event of a termination of mr walsh’s employment 1 by us without cause 2 by mr walsh for good reason 3 due to death or disability or 4 due to our election not to extend the employment term mr walsh will be deemed vested as of the termination date in any portion of the timebased option that would have otherwise vested if he had remained employed by us through the first anniversary of the termination date in the event of a change in control of the company or our parent bhp pts holdings llc all unvested rsus and timebased options will become fully vested as of the change in control or immediately prior to the change in control with respect to the options

generally all neos’ option awards other than those granted on june 25 2013 as part of the new option framework awards are divided into three tranches for vesting purposes a time option a performance option and an exit option 

as noted above onehalf of the options are subject to timebased vesting restrictions onesixth of the options are subject to performancebased vesting restrictions and onethird of the options are subject to exit eventbased vesting restrictions however to the extent any option holder had vested time options at the time of the exchange offer the number of time options granted in the exchange offer was adjusted so that after the exchange offer onehalf of the option holder’s aggregate options would be timebased the timebased options are scheduled to vest based on a five year vesting schedule accordingly other than with respect to mr walsh’s mostrecently granted options as noted above subject to continued employment with us through the applicable vesting dates 20 of the options subject to timebased vesting will vest and become exercisable on each of the first five anniversaries of the date of grant or vesting reference date as applicable or the date of commencement of employment in the case of mr chiminski in addition solely for mr chiminski to the extent that all or a fraction of the exit eventbased vesting options vest a proportionate amount of each tranche of unvested timebased options will vest subject to continued employment with us through the applicable vesting dates the performancebased vesting options will vest and become exercisable with respect to 20 of the options subject to performancebased vesting on each of the first five anniversaries of the date of grant or vesting reference date as applicable which date is either before or after the end of the applicable fiscal year depending on the grant date of the options if we achieve specified ebitda performance targets subject to a cumulative catchup the ebitda performance targets were established at levels that are reasonably attainable but challenging to achieve fiscal 2010 budgeted ebitda served as the base line target for the first fiscal year in the vesting schedule and the targets for the remaining four fiscal years of the vesting schedule are based on eight percent 8 year over year increases thereafter the exit eventbased vesting options will vest and become exercisable in two tiers if either specified internal rate of return or multiple of investment targets are achieved as follows 

 however subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date in the event that the 25 multiple hurdle or the 20 internal rate of return hurdle is not met but the 175 multiple hurdle or the 15 internal rate of return hurdle is met the first tier of options will vest based on straight line interpolation between the two points
