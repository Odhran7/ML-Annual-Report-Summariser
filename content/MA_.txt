our business 

our operations and network 

we operate a unique and proprietary global payments network our core network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions permitting account holders to use a mastercard product at millions of acceptance locations worldwide our core network facilitates an efficient and secure means for receiving payments a convenient quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and a channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network we authorize clear and settle transactions through our core network for our issuer customers in more than 150  currencies and in more than 210  countries and territories vocalink expands our range of payment capabilities beyond our core network into realtime accountbased payments 

typical transaction    our core network supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payments network the following diagram depicts a typical transaction on our core network and our role in that transaction 

in a typical transaction an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products after the transaction is authorized by the issuer the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” rate to the merchant 

 switched transactions 

 core network architecture our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers enabling them to expand into regional and global markets it is based largely on a distributed peertopeer architecture with an intelligent edge that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction our core network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple valueadded services such as fraud scoring or rewards at the point of sale to appropriate transactions in real time our core network’s architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring it has 24hour a day availability and worldclass response time 

realtime accountbased payment systems augmenting our core network we now offer realtime accountbased payment capabilities through our acquisition of vocalink which enables payments between bank accounts in near realtime in countries in which it has been deployed

digital payments our networks support and enable our digital payment platforms products and solutions reflecting the growing digital economy where consumers are increasingly seeking to use their payment accounts to pay when where and how they want 

customer risk    we guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network we refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure we do not however guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances

competition 

we compete in the global payments industry against all forms of payment including 

 we face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry 



our competitive advantages include our 

 government regulation 

general    government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our integrated products and services are used see “risk factors” in part i item 1a for more detail and examples 

payments oversight    several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry actions by these organizations could influence other organizations around the world to adopt or consider adopting similar oversight as a result mastercard could be subject to new regulation supervisions and examination requirements for example in the uk the bank of england has expanded its oversight of systemically important payment systems to include service providers as well also in the eea the implementation of psd2 will require financial institutions to provide third party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts which may enable these processors to route transactions away from mastercard products by offering certain services directly to people who currently use our products psd2 will also require a new standard for authentication of transactions which necessitates additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions this may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards 

interchange fees interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation and litigation examples include statutes in the united states that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities and european union legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the eea for more detail see our risk factors in “risk factorsregulations related to our participation in the payments industry” in part i item 1a also see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

preferential or protective government actions some governments have taken action to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers as well as to create their own national providers for example governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies in china we are currently excluded from domestic switching and are seeking market access which is uncertain and subject to a number of factors including receiving regulatory approval we are in active discussions to explore different solutions 

payment systems regulation  regulators in several countries around the world either have or are seeking to establish authority to regulate certain aspects of the payment systems in their countries such authority has resulted in regulation of various aspects of our business in the european union legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities brand products franchise and licensing from our switched transactions and other processing in terms of how we go to market make decisions and organize our structure additionally several jurisdictions have created or granted authority to create new regulatory bodies that either have or would have the authority to regulate payment systems including the united kingdom’s psr vocalink and mastercard are both participants in the payments system and are therefore subject to the psr’s duties and powers india which has also 

designated us as a payments system subject to regulation the national bank of belgium and regulators in brazil hong kong mexico and russia 

antimoney laundering counter terrorist financing economic sanctions and anticorruption we are subject to antimoney laundering “aml” and counter terrorist financing “ctf” laws and regulations globally including the us bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act as well as the various economic sanctions programs including those imposed and administered by the us office of foreign assets control “ofac” we have implemented a comprehensive amlctf program comprised of policies procedures and internal controls including the designation of a compliance officer which is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks the economic sanctions programs administered by ofac restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies specifically crimea cuba iran north korea and syria and with persons and entities included in ofac sanctions lists including its list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” we take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with ofac and other applicable sanctions including establishing a riskbased compliance program that has policies procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries regions individuals or entities as part of this program we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and the us sanctions programs including requiring the screening of account holders and merchants respectively against ofac sanctions lists including the sdn list iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states and we have no offices subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in any of these countries or geographies and do not license entities domiciled there we are also subject to anticorruption laws and regulations globally including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act which among other things generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk 

financial sector oversight we are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers in addition we are or may be subject to regulation by a number of agencies charged with oversight of among other things consumer protection financial and banking matters the regulators have supervisory and independent examination authority as well as enforcement authority that we may be subject to because of the services we provide to financial institutions that issue and acquire our products 

issuer practice legislation and regulation    our customers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in their capacity as issuers and otherwise impacting us as a consequence such regulations and investigations have been related to payment card addon products campus cards bank overdraft practices fees issuers charge to account holders and the transparency of terms and conditions additionally regulations such as psd2 in the eea require financial institutions to provide thirdparty paymentprocessors access to consumer payment accounts enabling them to provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers 

regulation of internet and digital transactions    various jurisdictions have enacted or have proposed regulation related to internet transactions the legislation applies to payments system participants including us and our us customers and is implemented through a federal regulation we may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling including fantasy sports certain jurisdictions are also considering regulatory initiatives in digitalrelated areas that could impact us such as cybersecurity and copyright and trademark infringement 

privacy data protection and information security aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex privacy and data protection laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere around the world for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program in the european union we are subject to the gdpr which requires a comprehensive privacy and data protection program to protect the personal and sensitive data of eea residents a number of regulators and policymakers around the globe are using the gdpr as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy and data protection laws including in the us california argentina brazil chile india indonesia and kenya some jurisdictions are currently considering adopting “data localization” requirements which mandate the collection processing andor storage of data within their borders including india kenya and vietnam due to constant changes to the nature of data and the use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence regulations in this area are constantly evolving with regulatory and legislative authorities in numerous parts of the world adopting proposals to protect information in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws are often uncertain and in a state of flux thus requiring constant monitoring for compliance 

additional regulatory developments   various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us including evolving laws surrounding marijuana prepaid payroll cards virtual currencies identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly

 item 1a risk factors 

legal and regulatory 

payments industry regulation 

global regulatory and legislative activity directly related to the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

regulators increasingly seek to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours or establish or expand their authority to do so many jurisdictions have enacted such regulations these regulations have established and could further expand obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer to financial institutions for consumers the countries in which our integrated products and services may be used the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services new regulations and oversight could also relate to our clearing and settlement activities including risk management policies and procedures collateral requirements participant default policies and procedures the ability to complete timely switching of financial transactions and capital and financial resource requirements in addition several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world   have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry and in some cases are considering designating certain payments networks as “systemically important payment systems” or “critical infrastructure” 

these obligations designations and restrictions may further expand and could conflict with each other as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payment systems 

some enacted regulations require financial institutions to provide third party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts this may enable these third party payment processors to route transactions away from mastercard products by offering account information or payment initiation services directly to people who currently use our products this may also allow these processors to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions new authentication standards have been enacted requiring additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions this may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience an increase in the rate of abandoned transactions could adversely impact our volumes or other operational metrics 

increased regulation and oversight of payment systems may result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our costs such laws or compliance burdens could result in issuers and acquirers being less willing to participate in our payments system reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products making our products less desirable to consumers reduce the volume of domestic and crossborder transactions or other operational metrics disintermediate us impact our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to its system rules procedures or operations or could require customization with regard to such changes which could impact market participant risk and therefore risk to us such regulatory changes could lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system by financial institutions or other customers moreover failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions civil damages or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation 

increased regulatory legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business 

interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of our products although we do not earn revenues from interchange interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products if interchange rates are too high merchants may stop accepting our products or route debit transactions away from our network if interchange rates are too low issuers may stop promoting our integrated products and services eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits eg free checking or low interest rates on balances or charge fees to account holders eg annual fees or late payment fees 

governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation competition law central bank regulation and litigation see “government regulation” and   note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange rates issuers may be less willing to participate in our fourparty payments system or may reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products reducing the attractiveness of our products to consumers in particular potential changes to interregional interchange fees as a result of the proposed resolution of the european commission’s investigation could impact our crossborder transaction activity disproportionately versus competitors that are not subject to similar reductions these and other impacts could lower transaction volumes andor make proprietary threeparty networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could reduce the benefits associated with our products or choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services in addition issuers could seek to decrease the expense of their payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge this could make our products less desirable to consumers reduce the volume of transactions and our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products 

we are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates any resulting legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result and in some cases has resulted in us being fined andor having to pay civil damages the amount of which could be material 

current regulatory activity could be extended to additional jurisdictions or products which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

regulators around the world increasingly replicate other regulators’ approaches with regard to the regulation of payments and other industries consequently regulation in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions similarly new laws and regulations within a country state or region involving one product may lead to regulation of similar or related products for example regulations affecting debit transactions could lead to regulation of other products such as credit 

as a result the risks to our business created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction these include matters like interchange rates potential direct regulation of our network fees and pricing network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business to meet the varying requirements either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have historically implemented policies referred to as nosurcharge rules in certain jurisdictions including the united states that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these nosurcharge rules or indicated interest in doing so additionally we have modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations it is possible that over time merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change this could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably andor using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

preferential or protective government actions 

preferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries have acted or in the future may act to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and switching providers or have created or may in the future create their own national provider this action may displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers for example 

 such developments prevent us from utilizing our global switching capabilities for domestic or regional customers our efforts to effect change in or work with these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

privacy data protection and security 

regulation of privacy data protection security and the digital economy could increase our costs as well as negatively impact our growth 

we are subject to increasingly complex regulations related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business these regulations could result in negative impacts to our business as we continue to develop integrated 

products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace as well as acquire new companies we may expand our information profile through the collection of additional data from additional sources and across multiple channels this expansion could amplify the impact of these regulations on our business regulation of privacy and data protection and information security often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer andor security of personal and sensitive information we are also subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirements in the european union and policymakers around the globe are using these requirements as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy laws that could result in similar or stricter requirements in other jurisdictions some jurisdictions are also considering requirements to collect process andor store data within their borders as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad leading to technological and operational implications other jurisdictions are considering adopting sectorspecific regulations for the payments industry including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements that overlap or conflict with or diverge from general privacy rules failure to comply with these laws regulations and requirements could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

new requirements or reinterpretations of existing requirements in these areas or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital economy in general may also increase our costs and could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring the development of informationbased products and solutions and technology operations in addition these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products which may in turn decrease the number of our payment products that they issue moreover due to account data compromise events and privacy abuses by other companies as well as the disclosure of monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies in combination with the use of artificial intelligence and new technologies there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements andor future enforcement those developments have also raised public attention on companies’ data practices and have changed consumer and societal expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

in addition fraudulent activity could encourage regulatory intervention which could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services or increase our compliance costs criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become common in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products while we are taking measures to make card and digital payments more secure increased fraud levels involving our integrated products and services or misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our integrated products and services could lead to regulatory intervention such as enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation 

other regulation 

regulations that directly or indirectly apply to mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our integrated products and services are used many of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that at times consequently affect us regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “business  government regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation examples include 



 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products actions by regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures amplifying any potential compliance burden finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties each may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance andor our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation 

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments as well as various nonus jurisdictions potential changes in existing tax laws including future regulatory guidance may impact our effective tax rate and tax payments there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations both within the us and the other jurisdictions in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations similarly changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any changes in enacted tax laws rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations 

litigation 

liabilities we may incur or limitations on our business related to any litigation or litigation settlements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations including among others those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings in the event we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damages which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements such as changes to our nosurcharge rule in the united states any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could impact our relationships with our customers including reducing the volume of business that we do with them which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

business and operations 

competition and technology 

substantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash and checks electronic mobile and ecommerce payment platforms cryptocurrencies ach payment services and other payments networks which can have several competitive impacts on our business 

 certain of our competitors operate threeparty payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business models if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a fourparty system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not we could lose business to these competitors see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems ecommerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices as well as physical store locations a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business 

as the payments industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risks including 



 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our mastercardbranded cards and enabled products and services we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support that promote our products in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to switch additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations in addition increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth 

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes which can impact our business in several ways 



 we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

operating a realtime accountbased payment network presents risks that could materially affect our business 

our acquisition of vocalink in 2017 added realtime accountbased payment technology to the suite of capabilities we offer while expansion into this space presents business opportunities there are also regulatory and operational risks associated with administering a realtime accountbased payment network 

british regulators have designated this platform to be “critical national infrastructure” and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of realtime accountbased payment systems in similar ways in addition any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts including potential intervention by the bank of england and significant reputational risk to vocalink and us for a discussion of the regulatory risks related to our realtime accountbased payment platform see our risk factor in “risk factors  payments industry regulation” in this part i item 1a furthermore the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities that are different from those faced on our core network operational difficulties such as the temporary unavailability of our services or products or security breaches on our realtime accountbased payment network could cause a loss of business for these products and services result in potential liability for us and adversely affect our reputation 

working with new customers and end users as we expand our integrated products and services can present operational challenges be costly and result in reputational damage if the new products or services do not perform as intended 

the payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer and consumer needs in order to remain competitive and meet the needs of the payments market we are continually involved in diversifying our integrated products and services these efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems these projects also carry risks associated with working with different types of customers for example organizations such as corporations that are not financial institutions and nongovernmental organizations “ngos” and end users than those we have traditionally worked with these differences may present new operational challenges in the development and implementation of our new products or services 

our failure to render these integrated products and services could make our other integrated products and services less desirable to customers or put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition if there is a delay in the implementation of our products or services or if our products or services do not perform as anticipated we could face additional regulatory scrutiny fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as negatively impact our brand and reputation 

information security and service disruptions 

information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for payments and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain as well as account holders rely on our digital technologies computer systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our 

integrated products and services our customers and account holders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control we like other financial technology organizations routinely are subject to cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to attempted cyberattacks because of our position in the payments value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks additionally geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers 

to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our integrated products and services which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as the lack of availability of our valueadded services as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties in addition they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs to us such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

despite various mitigation efforts that we undertake there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payments and technology industries our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of thirdparty vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities as a result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

in addition to information security risks for our systems we also routinely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment transaction data which affect millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of account holders further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage andor lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payments in addition to reputational concerns the cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by among other things making it more difficult to identify consumers moreover while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers we could still face damage claims which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our results of operations such events could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes results of operations and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us 

service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could materially affect our overall business and results of operations 

our transaction switching systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions fire weather events power outages telecommunications disruptions terrorism workplace violence accidents or other catastrophic events our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists activists or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities andor systems additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks because of the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business any interruption or 

degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations 

financial institution customers and other stakeholder relationships 

losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest financial institution customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 

most of our financial institution customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest financial institution customers loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

exclusivenear exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business 

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation   in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor if significant consolidation among customers were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for us which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers these developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and in many jurisdictions their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands 

while we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system including merchants governments and large digital companies and other technology companies we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services furthermore we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market we do not issue cards or other payment devices extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies as well as regulation if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in “risk factors  settlement and thirdparty obligations” in this part i item 1a with respect to how we guarantee certain thirdparty obligations for further discussion 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with account holders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively 

manage our brands and the perception of our payments system among consumers in these countries we also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries alongside our own relationships with them from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business 

merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

merchants are important constituents in our payments system we rely on both our relationships with them as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services we also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels create better purchase experiences improve efficiencies increase revenues and fight fraud in the retail industry there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard has been defending including the us merchant litigations see our risk factor in “risk factors – risks related to our participation in the payments industry” in this part i item 1a with respect to payments industry regulation including interchange fees the continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payments may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products we also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create cobranded payment programs with us as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives additionally if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer 

our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 

as we increase our work with national state and local governments both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 settlement and thirdparty obligations 

our role as guarantor as well as other contractual obligations expose us to risk of loss or illiquidity 

we are a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of certain of our customers in this capacity we are exposed to credit and liquidity risk from these customers and certain service providers we may incur significant losses in connection with transaction settlements if a customer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have significant contractual indemnification obligations with certain customers should an event occur that triggers these obligations such an event could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operations 

global economic and political environment 

global economic political financial and societal events or conditions could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

adverse economic trends in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following 

 additionally we switch substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and fees related to switched transactions revenue from switching crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases as well as major environmental events the uncertainty that could result from such events could decrease crossborder activity additionally any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also negatively impact our crossborder activity in each case decreased crossborder activity could decrease the revenue we receive 

any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations   

during 2018  approximately 67  of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies 

in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluation of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar if the us dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars such as what we have experienced in venezuela 

the occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the united kingdom’s proposed withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the uk from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk government triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty on march 29 2017 which commenced the official eu withdrawal process uncertainty over the terms of the uk’s departure from the eu could cause political and economic uncertainty in the uk and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results 

brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the uk and eu we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the uk may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the eu we may also face additional complexity with regard to immigration and travel rights for our employees located in the uk and the eu these factors may impact our ability to operate in the eu and uk seamlessly any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

brand and reputational impact 

negative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments industry in general from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances our use of social media or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us our products or merchants or other end users who utilize our products also as we are headquartered in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business 

lack of visibility of our brand in our products and services or in the products and services of our partners who use our technology may materially and adversely affect our business 

as more players enter the global payments system the layers between our brand and consumers and merchants increase in order to compete with other powerful consumer brands that are also becoming part of the consumer payment experience we often partner with those brands on payment solutions these brands include large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers and use our networks to build their own acceptance brands in some cases our brand may not be featured in the payment solution or may be secondary to other brands additionally as part of our relationships with some issuers our payment brand is only included on the back of the card as a result our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be the primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience this brand invisibility or any consumer confusion as to our role in the consumer payment experience could decrease the value of our brand which could adversely affect our business 

talent and culture 

we may not be able to attract hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce or maintain our corporate culture which could impact our ability to grow effectively 

our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of our employees particularly our key personnel and senior management we may be unable to retain or to attract highly qualified employees the market for key personnel is highly competitive particularly in technology and other skill areas significant to our business additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations and related enforcement have made it difficult for employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which we have operations and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent or to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation creativity and teamwork could harm our overall business and results of operations 

we rely on key personnel to lead with integrity to the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with our values we could experience significant impact to our brand and reputation as well as to our corporate culture 

acquisitions 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation 

although we may continue to evaluate andor make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them despite original intentions and focused efforts in addition such an integration may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition 

any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply this compliance could increase our costs and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage 

class a common stock and governance structure 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions and have an impact on changeincontrol 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power in addition 

 mastercard foundation’s substantial stock ownership and restrictions on its sales may impact corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to or favored by the other public stockholders 

as of february 8 2019  mastercard foundation owned 112181762  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 111  of our general voting power mastercard foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to may 1 2027 except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements for which purpose earlier sales are permitted mastercard foundation is permitted to sell all of its remaining shares after may 1 2027 subject to certain conditions the directors of mastercard foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by mastercard foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because mastercard foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders

 nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” our nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of the following special items “special items”

 see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  note 19 income taxes  and note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

we excluded these special items as management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from litigation judgments and settlements related to interchange and other onetime items as well as the related tax impacts 

in addition we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency which is a nongaap financial measure currencyneutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our us dollar reporting currency the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency we believe the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information 

we believe that the nongaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods we use nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation 

operating expenses operating margin effective income tax rate net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items are nongaap financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile our asreported financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap to the respective nongaap adjusted financial measures

1 represents the foreign currency translational and transactional impact 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our primary revenue functional currencies are the us dollar euro brazilian real and the british pound our overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our us dollar reporting currency 

our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume “gdv” and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volumerelated rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volumerelated rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies for example our billing in australia is in the us dollar however consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our us dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollarconverted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2018  gdv on a us dollarconverted basis increased 130  while gdv 

on a local currency basis increased 140  versus 2017  in 2017  gdv on a us dollarconverted basis increased 85  while gdv on a local currency basis increased 84  versus 2016  further the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency 

we incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts “foreign exchange activity” the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currencyneutral results see “nongaap financial information” and is recorded in general and administrative expenses we manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through our foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 22 foreign exchange risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 since we do not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives immediately in currentperiod earnings with the related hedged item being recognized as the exposures materialize 

we are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries in addition we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into us dollars while these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the us dollar andor a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries specifically in 2017 due to foreign exchange regulations which were restricting access to us dollars in venezuela an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuela bolivar and the us dollar impacted our ability to manage risk process crossborder transactions and satisfy us dollar denominated liabilities related to our venezuelan operations as a result of these factors we concluded that effective december 31 2017 we did not meet the accounting criteria for consolidation of these subsidiaries and therefore we transitioned to the cost method of accounting this accounting change resulted in a pretax charge of 167 million   108 million  after tax or 010  per diluted share in 2017 we continue to operate and serve our venezuelan issuers acquirers merchants and account holders with our products and services see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

financial results 

revenue 

gross revenue increased 19  and 18  or 19  and 17  on a currencyneutral basis in 2018  and 2017  respectively versus the prior year the increase in both 2018  and 2017  was primarily driven by an increase in transactions dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands for both domestic and crossborder transactions and other paymentrelated products and services 

rebates and incentives increased 18  and 22  in 2018  and 2017  respectively versus the prior year both as reported and on a currencyneutral basis the increases in rebates and incentives in 2018  and 2017  were primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes 

our net revenue increased 20  and 16  or 20  and 15  on a currencyneutral basis in 2018  and 2017  respectively versus the prior year current year results include growth of 4  percentage points from the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard and an additional 05  percentage points from our prior year acquisitions 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a further discussion of the new revenue guidance additionally see note 3 revenue  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a further discussion of how we recognize revenue 

the significant components of our net revenue were as follows 



the following table summarizes the primary drivers of net revenue growth 

note table may not sum due to rounding

3  includes impact from pricing and other nonvolume based fees 

4 includes impact of the allocation of revenue to service deliverables which are recorded in other revenue when services are performed 

5 includes impacts from advisors fees safety and security fees loyalty and reward solution fees and other paymentrelated products and services 

6 includes the impact from timing of new renewed and expired agreements 

the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

in 2016 our gdv was impacted by the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments which became effective in june 2016 the regulation requires that we no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use our network brand prior to that we collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries particularly france on transactions with mastercard cobadged cards if the brands of domestic networks as opposed to mastercard were used as a result the non mastercard cobadged volume is no longer being included 

the following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard for comparability purposes we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 of the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments to exclude the prior period cobadged volume processed by other networks 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

the following table reflects crossborder volume and switched transactions growth rates for comparability purposes we normalized the growth rates for the effects of differing switching days between periods additionally we adjusted the switched transactions growth rate for the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries in 2017 for a more detailed discussion of the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 



1  adjusted for the deconsolidation of venezuela subsidiaries 

no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total net revenue in any such period a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2018  the net revenue from these customers was approximately 31 billion  or 21  of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue 

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 31  and 17  in 2018  and 2017  respectively versus the prior year excluding the impact of the special items adjusted operating expenses increased 15  and 16  in 2018  and 2017  respectively versus the prior year both as adjusted and on a currencyneutral basis acquisitions contributed 2  percentage points of growth in 2018  

the components of operating expenses were as follows

2 see “nongaap financial information” for further information on special items 

the primary drivers of general and administrative expenses in 2018  and 2017 versus the prior year were as follows 

 advertising and marketing 

in 2018  advertising and marketing expenses increased 18  both as reported and on a currencyneutral basis versus 2017  primarily due to a change in accounting for certain marketing fund arrangements as a result of our adoption of the new revenue guidance partially offset by a net decrease in spending on certain marketing campaigns for a more detailed discussion on the impact of the new revenue guidance refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  in 2017  advertising and marketing expenses increased 11  or 10  on a currencyneutral basis versus 2016  mainly due to higher marketing spend primarily related to certain marketing campaigns 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 5  and 17  in 2018  and 2017  respectively versus the prior year both as reported and on a currencyneutral basis the increase in 2018  was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions partially offset by the full amortization of certain intangible assets in 2017  the increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions 

provision for litigation 

in 2018  we recorded pretax charges of 1128 million  which includes 654 million  related to a fine issued by the european commission 237 million  related to both the us merchant class litigation and the filed and anticipated optout us merchant cases and 237 million  related to litigation settlements with uk and paneuropean merchants during 2017  and 2016  we recorded pretax charges of 15 million  and 117 million  related to litigations with merchants in canada and the uk respectively see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses total other expense decreased 22 million  to 78 million  in 2018  versus 100 million  in 2017  due to higher investment income partially offset by higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in february 2018 and higher equity losses in the current year total other expense decreased 15 million  to 100 million  in 2017  versus 115 million  in 2016  due to lower impairment charges taken on certain investments last year and a gain on an investment recorded in 2017 partially offset by higher interest expense from debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 us tax reform was enacted into law with the effective date for most provisions being january 1 2018 us tax reform represents significant changes to the us internal revenue code and among other things 

 while the effective date of the law for most provisions was january 1 2018 gaap requires the effects of changes in tax rates be accounted for in the reporting period of enactment which was the 2017 reporting period 

the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  were 187  400  and 281  respectively the effective income tax rate for 2018  was lower than the effective income tax rate for 2017  primarily due to additional tax expense of 873 million  attributable to us tax reform in 2017 a lower 2018 statutory tax rate in the us and belgium and a more favorable geographic mix of earnings the lower effective tax rate is also attributable to discrete tax benefits relating primarily to 90 million  of foreign tax credits generated in 2018 which can be carried back and utilized in 2017 under transition rules in the proposed foreign tax credit regulations issued on november 28 2018 along with provisions for legal matters in the united states these benefits were partially offset by the nondeductible nature of the fine issued by the european commission excluding the impact of special items the 2018  adjusted effective income tax rate improved by 83  percentage points to 185  from 268  in 2017  primarily due to the lower tax rate in the us and a more favorable geographical mix of earnings 

the effective income tax rate for 2017 was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2016 primarily due to additional tax expense of 873 million  attributable to us tax reform which included provisional amounts of 825 million  related to the transition tax the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset balance in the us and the recognition of a deferred tax liability related to a change in assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of a substantial amount of our foreign earnings as well as 48 million  due to a foregone foreign tax credit benefit on current year repatriations excluding the impact of us tax reform and other special items the 2017 adjusted effective income tax rate improved by 13  percentage points to 268  from 281  in 2016 primarily due to a more favorable geographical mix of earnings partially offset by a lower us foreign tax credit benefit 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 21  for 2018 and 350  for 2017 and 2016 to pretax income for the years ended december 31  as a result of the following 



1  included within the impact of the 2018  foreign tax credits is a 90 million  tax benefit relating to the carry back of certain foreign tax credits additionally included in 2016 is a 116 million  benefit associated with the repatriation of 2016 foreign earnings there was no benefit associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2018  and 2017  due to the enactment of us tax reform 

our gaap effective income tax rates for 2018  2017  and 2016  were affected by the tax benefits related to the special items as previously discussed 

our unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior periods were 164 million  and 183 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively all of which would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized within the next twelve months we believe that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local tax examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of our operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region our subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance 

see note 19 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we rely on existing liquidity cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations credit and settlement exposure capital expenditures investments in our business and current and potential obligations the following table summarizes the cash cash equivalents investments and credit available to us at december 31  



1  investments include availableforsale securities and shortterm heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2018  and 2017  this amount excludes restricted cash related to the us merchant class litigation settlement of 553 million  and 546 million  respectively this amount also excludes restricted security deposits held for customers of 11 billion  at both december 31 2018  and 2017  

in 2017 as a result of us tax reform among other things we changed our assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the us for certain of our foreign affiliates and recognized a provisional deferred tax liability of 36 million  in 2018 we completed our analysis of global working capital and cash needs it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest approximately 09 billion  of our historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with certain foreign subsidiaries outside of the us see note 19 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions we guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers see note 21 settlement and other risk management  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for a description of these guarantees historically payments under these guarantees have not been significant however historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions including but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region 

our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a and note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and part ii item 7 business environment 

cash flow 

the table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 559 million  in 2018  versus 2017  primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for noncash items partially offset by deferred payments associated with us tax reform in the prior year and the timing of settlement with customers net cash provided by operating activities in 2017  versus 2016  increased by 10 billion  primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for noncash items and deferred payments associated with us tax reform 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 13 billion  in 2018  versus 2017  primarily due to 2017 acquisitions net cash used in investing activities increased 618 million  in 2017  versus 2016  primarily due to 2017 acquisitions and investments in nonmarketable equity investments partially offset by higher net proceeds of investment securities 

net cash used in financing activities increased 202 million  in 2018  versus 2017  primarily due to higher repurchases of our class a common stock and dividends paid partially offset by the proceeds from debt issued in the current year net cash used in financing activities increased 24 billion  in 2017  versus 2016  primarily due to proceeds from debt issued in 2016 higher repurchases of our class a common stock and dividends paid 

the table below shows a summary of select balance sheet data at december 31  



we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and investment securities balances our cash flow generating capabilities our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs capital asset purchases outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations 

debt and credit availability 

in february 2018 we issued 500 million  principal amount of notes due in 2028 and an additional 500 million  principal amount of notes due in 2048 our total debt outstanding including the current portion was 63 billion  and 54 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively with the earliest maturity of 500 million  of principal occurring in april 2019 

as of december 31 2018 we have a commercial paper program the “commercial paper program” under which we are authorized to issue up to 45 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance in conjunction with the commercial paper program we have a committed unsecured 45 billion  revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires in november 2023 

borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in addition we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31 2018  and 2017  

in march 2018 we filed a universal shelf registration statement replacing a previously filed shelf registration statement that was set to expire to provide additional access to capital if needed pursuant to the shelf registration statement we may from time to time offer to sell debt securities guarantees of debt securities preferred stock class a common stock depository shares purchase contracts units or warrants in one or more offerings 

see note 14 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion on our debt the commercial paper program and the credit facility 

dividends and share repurchases 

we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock subject to legally available funds we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs the following table summarizes the annual per share dividends paid in the years reflected 



on december 4 2018 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 033  per share paid on february 8 2019 to holders of record on january 9 2019 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend was 340 million  

on february 5 2019 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 033  per share payable on may 9 2019 to holders of record on april 9 2019 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be 339 million  

repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the operating needs of the business legal requirements price and economic and market conditions in december 2018 2017 and 2016 our board of directors approved share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to 65 billion  4 billion  and 4 billion  respectively of our class a common stock the program approved in 2018 became effective in january 2019 after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2017 the following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations of our class a common stock through december 31 2018  under the plans approved in 2018 2017 and 2016 



see note 15 stockholders’ equity  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2018  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



1  the table does not include the 16 billion  provision as of december 31 2018  related to litigation as the timing of payments is not fixed and determinable see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion the table also does not include the 219 million  accrual as of december 31 2018  related to the contingent consideration attributable to acquisitions made in 2017 which is pending our final assessment in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement this payment is expected to be completed in 2019 see note 7 fair value and investment securities  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

2  amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance we have accrued 41 billion  as of december 31 2018  related to customer and merchant agreements 

3  amounts relate to severance liabilities along with expected funding requirements for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 

4  amounts relate to the us tax liability on the transition tax on accumulated nonus earnings of us entities see note 19 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

5  amount relates to the fixedprice put option for the vocalink remaining shareholders to sell their ownership interest to mastercard on the third and fifth anniversaries of the transaction and quarterly thereafter see note 2 acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

6  we have recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 164 million  at december 31 2018  within the next twelve months we believe that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local examinations are reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 

seasonality 

we do not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2018  2017  or 2016  accounted for more than 30  of net revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers’ performance in order to recognize this revenue rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates we consider various factors in estimating customer performance including a review of specific transactions historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance if our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance net revenue may be materially different 

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

income taxes 

in calculating our effective income tax rate we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions through our interpretation of local tax regulations adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 

we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained 

and if so how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements if upon examination we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situations we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 

deferred taxes are established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred ultimately the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions 

valuation of assets 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing a quantitative assessment we use market capitalization for estimating the fair value of our reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment charge 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events and legal and regulatory factors if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

our estimates in the valuation of these assets are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 




 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately 113 million  on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2018  related to the hedging program in addition a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investments at december 31 2018  and 2017  

foreign exchange risk 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions we enter into foreign currency contracts to manage risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currencies of the entity 

we may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of earnings assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity the objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies principally the us dollar and euro 

foreign currency exposures are managed together through our foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 22 foreign exchange risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months  

as of december 31 2018  the majority of derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations had been entered into with our customers our derivative contracts are summarized below   



we also use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates with changes in the translated value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we have designated our eurodenominated debt as a net investment hedge for a portion of our net investment in european foreign operations our eurodenominated debt is vulnerable to changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rates the principal amounts of our eurodenominated debt as well as the effective interest rates and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included in note 14 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in fixed income securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of our availableforsale investments for fixed income securities as of december 31  was as follows 





we also have time deposits that are classified as heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2018  and 2017  the cost which approximates fair value of our shortterm heldtomaturity securities was 264 million  and 700 million  respectively 

at december 31 2018  we have us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt which is subject to interest rate risk the principal amounts of this debt as well as the effective interest rates and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included in note 14 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 see “future obligations” for estimated interest payments due by period relating to the us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt 

at december 31 2018  we have the commercial paper program and the credit facility which provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers borrowing rates under the commercial paper program are based on market conditions borrowing rates under the credit facility are variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement see note 14 debt  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for additional information on the credit facility and the commercial paper program we had no borrowings under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31 2018  and 2017

typical transaction   our core network supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payments network the following diagram depicts a typical transaction on our core network and our role in that transaction 

in a typical transaction an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products after the transaction is authorized by the issuer the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” rate as further described below to the merchant

 government regulation 

general    government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our integrated products and services are used see “risk factors” in part i item 1a for more detail and examples 

payments oversight    several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry actions by these organizations could influence other organizations around the world to adopt or consider adopting similar oversight as a result mastercard could be subject to new regulation supervisions and examination requirements for example in the uk the bank of england has expanded its oversight of systemically important payment systems to include service providers as well also in the eea the implementation of the revised payment services directive “psd2” will require financial institutions to provide third party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts which may enable these processors to route transactions away from mastercard products by offering certain services directly to people who currently use our products psd2 will also require a new standard for authentication of transactions which necessitate additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions this may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards 

interchange fees interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation and litigation examples include statutes in the united states that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities and european union legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the eea for more detail see our risk factors in “risk factorsregulations related to our participation in the payments industry” in part i item 1a also see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8

payments system regulation  regulators in several countries around the world either have or are seeking to establish authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in their countries such authority has resulted in regulation of various aspects of our business in the european union legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities brand products franchise and licensing from our switched transactions and other processing in terms of how we go to market make decisions and organize our structure additionally several jurisdictions have created or granted authority to create new regulatory bodies that either have or would have the authority to regulate payment systems including the united kingdom’s payments systems regulator psr which has designated us including our vocalink business as a payments system subject to regulation and the national bank of belgium 

antimoney laundering counter terrorist financing economic sanctions and anticorruption we are subject to antimoney laundering “aml” and counter terrorist financing “ctf” laws and regulations globally including the us bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act as well as the various economic sanctions programs including those imposed and administered by the us office of foreign assets control “ofac” we have implemented a comprehensive amlctf program comprised of policies procedures and internal controls including the designation of a compliance officer which is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks the economic sanctions programs administered by ofac restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies specifically crimea cuba iran north korea and syria and with persons and entities included in ofac sanctions lists including its list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” we take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with ofac and other applicable sanctions including establishing a riskbased compliance program that has policies procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries regions individuals or entities as part of this program we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and the us sanctions programs including requiring the screening of account holders and merchants respectively against ofac sanctions lists including the sdn list iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terrorist

financial sector oversight we are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers in addition we are or may be subject to regulation by a number of agencies charged with oversight of among other things consumer protection financial and banking matters the regulators have supervisory and independent examination authority as well as enforcement authority that we may be subject to because of the services we provide to financial institutions that issue and acquire our products 

issuer practice legislation and regulation    our customers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in their capacity as issuers and otherwise impacting us as a consequence such regulations and investigations have been related to payment card addon products campus cards bank overdraft practices fees issuers charge to account holders and the transparency of terms and conditions additionally regulations such as psd2 in the eea require financial institutions to provide thirdparty paymentprocessors access to consumer payment accounts enabling them to provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers 

regulation of internet and digital transactions    various jurisdictions have enacted or have proposed regulation related to internet transactions the legislation applies to payments system participants including us and our us customers and is implemented through a federal regulation we may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling including fantasy sports certain jurisdictions are also considering regulatory initiatives in digitalrelated areas that could impact us such as cybersecurity copyright and trademark infringement and privacy 

data protection and information security aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere around the world for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program in the european union we will be subject to the pending gdpr which goes into effect in may of 2018 this law will require a comprehensive data protection and privacy program to protect the personal and sensitive data of european citizens and residents due to constant changes to the nature of data regulations in this area are constantly evolving with regulatory and legislative authorities in numerous parts of the world considering proposals to protect information in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws are often uncertain and in a state of flux thus requiring constant monitoring for compliance 

additional regulatory developments   various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us including evolving laws surrounding marijuana prepaid payroll cards virtual currencies identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly

 item 1a risk factors 

legal and regulatory 

direct regulation of the payments industry 

global regulatory and legislative activity related to the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

regulators increasingly seek to regulate or establish or expand their authority to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours some recent examples of regulatory and legislative activity include 



 these regulations have established and could further expand obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer to financial institutions for consumers the countries in which our integrated products and services may be used the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services new regulations and oversight could also relate to our clearing and settlement activities including risk management policies and procedures collateral requirements participant default policies and procedures the ability to complete timely switching of financial transactions and capital and financial resource requirements in addition several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world that have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry and in some cases are considering designating certain payments networks as “systemically important payment systems” or “critical infrastructure” these obligations designations and restrictions may further expand and could conflict with each other as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payment systems 

as a result increased regulation and oversight of payment systems may result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our costs such laws or compliance burdens could result in issuers being less willing to participate in our payments system reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products making our products less desirable to consumers reduce the volume of domestic and crossborder transactions or other operational metrics disintermediate us impact our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to its system rules procedures or operations or could require customization with regard to such changes which could impact market participant risk and therefore risk to us such regulatory changes could lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system by financial institutions or other customers moreover failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions civil damages or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation 

increased regulatory legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business 

interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of our products although we do not earn revenues from interchange interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products if interchange rates are too high merchants may stop accepting our products or route debit transactions away from our network if interchange rates are too low issuers may stop promoting our integrated products and services eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits eg free checking low interest rates on balances or charge fees to account holders eg annual fees or late payment fees 

governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation competition law central bank regulation and litigation 

examples of regulatory and legislative activity include 



if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange rates issuers may be less willing to participate in our fourparty payments system or may reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products reducing the attractiveness of our products to consumers in particular any changes to interregional interchange fees as a result of the european commission’s statement of objections could impact our crossborder transaction activity disproportionately versus competitors that are not subject to similar reductions these and other impacts could lower transaction volumes andor make proprietary threeparty networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could reduce the benefits associated with our products or choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services in addition issuers could seek to decrease the expense of their payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge this could make our products less desirable to consumers reduce the volume of transactions and our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products 

we are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates any resulting legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in us being fined andor having to pay civil damages the amount of which could be material 

current regulatory activity could be extended to additional jurisdictions or products which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

regulators around the world increasingly replicate other regulators’ approaches with regard to the regulation of payments and other industries consequently regulation in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions similarly new laws and regulations within a country state or region involving one product may lead to regulation of similar or related products for example regulations affecting debit transactions could lead to regulation of other products such as credit 

as a result the risks to our business created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction these include matters like interchange rates potential direct regulation of our network fees and pricing network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business to meet the varying requirements either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have historically implemented policies referred to as nosurcharge rules in certain jurisdictions including the united states that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these nosurcharge rules or indicated interest in doing so additionally we have modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations it is possible that over time merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change this could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably andor using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

preferential or protective government actions 

preferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries have acted or in the future may act to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and switching providers or have created or may in the future create their own national provider this action may displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers for example 

 such developments prevent us from utilizing our global switching capabilities for domestic or regional customers our efforts to effect change in or work with these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

regulation related to our participation in the payments industry 

regulations that directly or indirectly affect the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our integrated products and services are used many of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that at times consequently affect us regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “businessgovernment regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation examples include 



practices act and the uk bribery act which among other things generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk a violation and subsequent judgment or settlement against us or those with whom we may be associated under these laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties damages andor have a significant reputational impact 

 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems actions by regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures amplifying any potential compliance burden finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties each may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance andor our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation 

we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments as well as various nonus jurisdictions 

potential changes in existing tax laws may impact our effective tax rate and tax payments for example the recent us tax legislation enacted on december 22 2017 represents a significant overhaul of the us federal tax code this tax legislation reduced the us statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall us federal tax liability in a given period however the tax legislation also included a number of provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions including interest expense performancebased compensation for certain executives and the domestic production activities deduction among others that could affect our us federal income tax position we are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and us federal income tax position see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion of the tcja while we expect the tcja to be favorable to the company overall there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations both within the us and the other jurisdictions in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations similarly changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities any changes in enacted tax laws rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition and results of operations 

privacy data protection and security 

regulation of privacy data protection security and the digital economy could increase our costs as well as negatively impact our growth 

we are subject to regulations related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business these regulations could result in negative impacts to our business as we continue to develop integrated products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace we may expand our information profile through the collection of additional data across multiple channels this expansion could amplify the impact of these regulations on our business regulation of privacy and data protection and information security often times require monitoring of and changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure storage andor security of personal and sensitive information in addition due to the european parliament’s passage of the gdpr and the european court of justice’s invalidation of the safe harbor treaty we are subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirements in the european union failure to comply with these laws regulations and requirements could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

new requirements or reinterpretations of existing requirements in these areas or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital economy in general may also increase our costs and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring the development of informationbased products and solutions and technology operations in addition these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products which may in turn decrease the number of our payment products that they issue moreover due to account data compromise events as well as the disclosure of the monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

in addition fraudulent activity could encourage regulatory intervention which could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services or increase our compliance costs criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become common in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products while we are taking measures to make card and digital payments more secure increased fraud levels involving our integrated products and services or misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our integrated products and services could lead to regulatory intervention such as enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation 

litigation 

liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations including among others those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings in the event we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damages which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements such as changes to our nosurcharge rule in the united states any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could impact our relationships with our customers including reducing the volume of business that we do with them which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

business and operations 

competition and technology 

substantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash and checks electronic mobile and ecommerce payment platforms cryptocurrencies ach payment services and other payments networks which can have several competitive impacts on our business 

 certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate threeparty payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers and these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business models if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a fourparty system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not we could lose business to these competitors see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems ecommerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices as well as physical store locations a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business 

as the payments industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risks including 



 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our mastercardbranded cards and enabled products and services we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support that promote our products in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations in addition increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth 

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes which can impact our business in several ways 



 we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

operating a new realtime accountbased payments network in connection with our vocalink acquisition presents risks that could materially affect our business 

our acquisition of vocalink in 2017 added realtime accountbased payment technology to the suite of capabilities we offer while expansion into this space presents business opportunities there are also regulatory and operational risks associated with administering a new type of payments network and with integrating this acquisition into our business 

operating a new type of payments system presents new regulatory and operational risks english regulators have designated this platform to be “critical national infrastructure” and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of realtime accountbased payments systems in similar ways in addition any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts including potential intervention by the bank of england and significant reputational risk to vocalink and us for a discussion of the regulatory risks related to our realtime accountbased payments platform see our risk factor in “risk factors  regulation related to our participation in the payments industry” in this part i item 1a furthermore the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities that are different from those faced on our core network while we are leveraging vocalink’s talent and expertise we may face challenges in adapting to the complex requirements of operating a new payments system operational difficulties such as the temporary unavailability of our services or products or security breaches on our realtime accountbased payments network could cause a loss of business for these products and services result in potential liability for us and adversely affect our reputation 

we are also working to embed the new products and technology acquired from vocalink into our existing markets this product convergence requires tight working relationships and integration with the people and corporate culture of vocalink as a critical success factor not managing the integration successfully could result in largerthanexpected integration costs which could be significant if we fail to successfully embed these new technologies we may lose existing vocalink business and may not remain competitive in our payment technology offerings as compared to our competitors see our risk factor in “risk factors  acquisitions” in this part i item 1a for more information on risks relating to the integrating our acquisitions 

working with new customers and end users as we expand our integrated products and services can present operational challenges be costly and result in reputational damage if the new products or services do not perform as intended 

the payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer and consumer needs in order to remain competitive and meet the needs of the payments market we are continually involved in diversifying our integrated products and services these efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems these projects also carry risks associated with working with different types of customers for example organizations such as corporations that are not financial institutions and nongovernmental organizations “ngos” and end users than those we have traditionally worked with these differences may present new operational challenges in the development and implementation of our new products or services 

our failure to render these integrated products and services could make our other integrated products and services less desirable to customers or put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition if there is a delay in the implementation of our products or services or if our products or services do not perform as anticipated we could face additional regulatory scrutiny fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as negatively impact our brand and reputation 

information security and service disruptions 

information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for payments and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain as well as account holders rely on our digital technologies computer systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our integrated products and services our customers and account holders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control we like other financial technology organizations routinely are subject to cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to attempted cyberattacks because of our position in the payments value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks additionally geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers 

to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our integrated products and services which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as the lack of availability of our valueadded systems as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties in addition they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs to us such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

we maintain an information security program a business continuity program and insurance coverage each reviewed by our board of directors and its audit committee and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks we also continually test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payments and technology industries our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and account holders when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of thirdparty vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities as a result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

in addition to information security risks for our systems we also routinely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment transaction data which affect millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of account holders these events some of which have been high profile typically involve external agents hacking the merchants’ or thirdparty processors’ systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage andor lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated products and services such events could also slow or reverse the trend 

toward electronic payments in addition to reputational concerns while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers we could still face damage claims which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our results of operations such events could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes results of operations and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us 

service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could materially affect our overall business and results of operations 

our transaction switching systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions fire weather events power outages telecommunications disruptions terrorism workplace violence accidents or other catastrophic events our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists activists or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities andor systems additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks because of the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations 

financial institution customers and other stakeholder relationships 

losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest financial institution customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 

most of our financial institution customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest financial institution customers loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

exclusivenear exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business 

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation   in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor if significant consolidation among customers were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for us which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers these developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and in many jurisdictions their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands 

while we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system including merchants governments and large digital companies and other technology companies we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services furthermore we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market we do not issue cards or other payment devices extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in “risk factors  settlement and thirdparty obligations” in this part i item 1a with respect to how we guarantee certain thirdparty obligations for further discussion 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with account holders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payments system among consumers in these countries we also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries alongside our own relationships with them from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business 

merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

merchants are important constituents in our payments system we rely on both our relationships with them as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated products and services we also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels create better purchase experiences improve efficiencies increase revenues and fight fraud in the retail industry there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard has been defending including the us merchant litigations see our risk factor in “risk factors – risks related to our participation in the payments industry” in this part i item 1a with respect to payments industry regulation including interchange fees the continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payments may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products we also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create cobranded payment programs with us as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives additionally if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer 

our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 

as we increase our work with national state and local governments both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments these risks include but are not limited to the following 



 settlement and thirdparty obligations 

our role as guarantor exposes us to risk of loss or illiquidity 

we are a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of 

 in this capacity we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity 

 concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our overall business and liquidity even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations should an event occur that would trigger any significant indemnification obligation which we owe to any customers or other companies such an obligation could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we mitigate the contingent risk of a settlement failure using various strategies including monitoring our customers’ financial condition their economic and political operating environments and their compliance with our participation standards for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices see note 19 settlement and other risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

global economic and political environment 

global financial market activity could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following 



 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

a decline in crossborder activity could adversely affect our results of operations 

we switch substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and fees related to switched transactions revenue from switching crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases additionally any regulation of interregional interchange fees could negatively impact our crossborder activity which could decrease the revenue we receive any such decline in crossborder activity could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

negative trends in spending could negatively impact our results of operations 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our products 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations   

during 2017  approximately 65  of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies 

in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluation of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar if the us dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars such as what we have experienced in venezuela 

the occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the united kingdom’s proposed withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial results 

in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the uk from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk government triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty on may 29 2017 which commenced the official eu withdrawal process uncertainty over the terms of the uk’s departure from the eu could cause political and economic uncertainty in the uk and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial results 

brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the uk and eu we as well as our clients who have significant operations in the uk may incur additional costs and expenses as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks from the rest of the eu in addition because we conduct business in and have operations in the uk we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate eu member states we may also face additional complexity with regard to immigration and travel rights for our employees located in the uk and the eu these factors may impact our ability to operate in the eu and uk seamlessly any of these effects of brexit among others could harm our business and financial results 

reputational impact 

negative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments industry in general from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” additionally large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers use our networks to build their own acceptance brands which could cause consumer confusion and decrease the value of our brand moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances our use of social media or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us our products or merchants or other end users who utilize our products also as we are headquartered in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business 

acquisitions 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation 

although we may continue to evaluate andor make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them despite original intentions and focused efforts in addition such an integration may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition 

any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply this compliance could increase our costs and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage 

class a common stock and governance structure 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions and have an impact on changeincontrol 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power in addition 



 mastercard foundation’s substantial stock ownership and restrictions on its sales may impact corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to or favored by the other public stockholders 

as of february 9 2018  mastercard foundation owned 112181762  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 108  of our general voting power mastercard foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to may 1 2027 except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements for which purpose earlier sales are permitted mastercard foundation is permitted to sell all of its remaining shares after may 1 2027 the directors of mastercard foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by mastercard foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because mastercard foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” together “mastercard” or the “company” included elsewhere in this report this change only relates to terminology no previously reported amounts have changed percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand 

business overview 

mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers financial institutions merchants governments digital partners businesses and other organizations worldwide enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks through our global payments processing network we facilitate the switching authorization clearing and settlement of payment transactions and deliver related products and services we make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of wellknown brands including mastercard® maestro® cirrus® and masterpass® our recent acquisition of vocalink holdings limited “vocalink” has expanded our capability to process automated clearing house “ach” transactions among other things as a multirail network we now offer customers one partner to turn to for their payment needs for both domestic and crossborder transactions we also provide valueadded offerings such as safety and security products information services and consulting loyalty and reward programs and issuer and acquirer processing our networks are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system 

a typical transaction on our core network involves four participants in addition to us account holder a consumer who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment merchant issuer the account holder’s financial institution and acquirer the merchant’s financial institution we do not issue cards extend credit determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our branded products in most cases account holder relationships belong to and are managed by our financial institution customers 

we generate revenues from assessing our customers based on the gross dollar volume the “gdv” of activity on the products that carry our brands from the fees we charge to our customers for providing transaction processing and from other paymentrelated products and services 

business environment 

we authorize clear and settle transactions in more than 210  countries and territories and in more than 150  currencies net revenue generated in the united states was 35  of total revenue in 2017  and 38  in 2016  and 39  in 2015  no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total net revenue in any such period but differences in market growth economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets currency fluctuations turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate certain of our customers merchants that accept our brands and account holders who use our brands have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions 

our financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in addition political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted we continue to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry notwithstanding recent encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for us to grow our business

 nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” these nongaap financial measures exclude the impact of the following special items “special items” we excluded these special items as management monitors significant changes in tax law litigation judgments and settlements related to interchange and regulation and significant onetime items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts 



employee pension plan settlement charge” see note 11 pension postretirement and savings plans  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion of the us employee pension plan settlement charge 

in addition we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency which is a nongaap financial measure for 2017  and 2016  we present currencyneutral growth rates which are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our us dollar reporting currency the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency our management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information 

our management believes that the nongaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods our management uses nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation 

net revenue operating expenses operating margin effective income tax rate net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items andor the impact of foreign currency are nongaap financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with gaap the following tables reconcile our asreported financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap to the respective nongaap adjusted financial measures

1 represents the foreign currency translational and transactional impact 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our us dollar reporting currency 

our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume “gdv” and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volumerelated rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volumerelated rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies for example our billing in australia is in the us dollar however consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our us dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollarconverted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2017  gdv on a us dollarconverted basis increased 87  while gdv on a local currency basis increased 86  versus 2016  in 2016  gdv on a us dollarconverted basis increased 55  while gdv on a local currency basis increased 91  versus 2015  further the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction 

processing revenue other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency 

in addition we incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts “foreign exchange activity” the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currencyneutral results see “nongaap financial information” and is recorded in general and administrative expenses we attempt to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through our foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 since we do not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize 

we are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries in addition we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of financial assets into us dollars while these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the us dollar andor a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries specifically in venezuela due to increasing foreign exchange regulations restricting access to us dollars an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuela bolivar and the us dollar has impacted our ability to manage risk process crossborder transactions and satisfy us dollar denominated liabilities related to our venezuelan operations as a result of these factors we concluded that effective december 31 2017 we did not meet the accounting criteria for consolidation of these subsidiaries and therefore we would transition to the cost method of accounting as of december 31 2017 this accounting change resulted in a pretax charge of 167 million   108 million  after tax or 010  per diluted share we continue to operate and serve our venezuelan issuers acquirers merchants and account holders with our products and services we do not believe this accounting change will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements in future periods see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

financial results 

revenue 

revenue description 

our business model involves four participants in addition to us account holders merchants issuers the account holders’ financial institutions and acquirers the merchants’ financial institutions we generate revenues from assessing our customers based on the gdv of activity on the products that carry our brands from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and from other paymentrelated products and services our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro brazilian real and the british pound 

the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following 



we classify our net revenue into the following five categories 



revenue analysis 

gross revenue increased 18  and 14  or 17  and 15  on a currency neutral basis in 2017  and 2016  respectively versus the prior year the increase in both 2017  and 2016  was primarily driven by an increase in transactions dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands for both domestic and crossborder transactions and other paymentrelated products and services 

rebates and incentives increased 22  and 20  in 2017  and 2016  respectively or 22  on a currency neutral basis in both periods the increases in rebates and incentives in 2017  and 2016  were primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes 

our net revenue increased 16  and 11  or 15  and 13  on a currency neutral basis respectively versus the prior year 

the significant components of our net revenue were as follows 



the following table summarizes the primary drivers of net revenue growth 

note table may not sum due to rounding 

 not applicable 

1  represents the foreign currency translational and transactional impact versus the prior year 

2  includes impact from pricing and other nonvolume based fees 

3 includes impact of the allocation of revenue to service deliverables which are recorded in other revenue when services are performed 

4 includes impacts from advisor fees safety and security fees loyalty and reward solution fees and other paymentrelated products and services 

5 includes the impact from timing of new renewed and expired agreements 

the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

in 2016 our gdv was impacted by the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments which became effective in june 2016 the regulation requires that we no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use our network brand prior to that we collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries particularly france on transactions with mastercard cobadged cards if the brands of domestic networks as opposed to mastercard were used as a result the nonmastercard cobadged volume is no longer being included 

the following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard for comparability purposes we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 of the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments to exclude the prior period cobadged volume processed by other networks 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2017  the net revenue from these customers was approximately 29 billion  or 23  of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue in addition as part of our business strategy among other efforts we enter into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see our risk factor in “risk factor  business risks” in part i item 1a for further discussion 

operating expenses 

operating expenses increased 17  and 9  in 2017  and 2016  respectively versus the prior year excluding the impact of the special items adjusted operating expenses increased 16  and 10  or 16  and 12  on a currency neutral basis in 2017  and 2016  respectively acquisitions contributed 6  percentage points of growth in 2017  

the components of operating expenses were as follows

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 22  and 11  in 2017  and 2016  respectively versus the prior year excluding the impact of special items adjusted general and administrative expenses increased 17  and 14  in 2017  and 2016  respectively versus the prior year acquisitions contributed 6  percentage points and 1 percentage point of growth in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the significant components of our general and administrative expenses were as follows 



note table may not sum due to rounding 

 not meaningful 

1  see “nongaap financial information” for further information on special items 

the primary drivers of changes in general and administrative expenses in 2017  and 2016  were 

 advertising and marketing 

in 2017  advertising and marketing expenses increased 11  versus 2016  mainly due to higher marketing spend primarily related to masterpass advertising and marketing expenses decreased 1  in 2016  mainly due to lower sponsorship promotions compared to 2015  

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 17  and 2  in 2017  and 2016  respectively versus the prior year the increase in 2017  was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions in 2016  the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation from capital investments partially offset by certain intangibles becoming fully amortized 

provision for litigation settlements 

during 2017  and 2016  we recorded pretax charges of 15 million  and 117 million  related to litigations with merchants in canada and the uk respectively during 2015  we recorded a pretax charge of 61 million  related to litigations with merchants in the uk see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses total other expense decreased 15 million  to 100 million  in 2017  versus 115 million  in 2016  due to lower impairment charges taken on certain investments last year and a gain on an investment in the current year partially offset by higher interest expense from debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2016  total other expense decreased 5 million  to 115 million  in 2016  versus 120 million  in 2015  due to lower impairment charges taken on certain investments and higher investment income in 2016  partially offset by higher interest expense from debt issued in 2015  and 2016  

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 in the us the tcja was signed into law the tcja represents significant changes to the us internal revenue code and among other things 

 while the effective date of the law for most of the above provisions is january 1 2018 gaap requires the resulting tax effects be accounted for in the reporting period of enactment the impact of the tcja is discussed further below and in note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015  were 400  281  and 232  respectively 

the effective income tax rate for 2017  was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2016  primarily due to additional tax expense of 873 million  attributable to the tcja which includes 825 million  of provisional charges related to the transition tax the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset balance in the us and the recognition of a deferred tax liability related to a change in assertion regarding the reinvestment of foreign earnings as well as 48 million  in additional tax expense due to a foregone foreign tax credit benefit on current year repatriations excluding the impact of the tcja and other special items the 2017 adjusted effective income tax rate improved by 13  percentage points to 268  from 281  in 2016 primarily due to a more favorable geographical mix of taxable earnings partially offset by a lower us foreign tax credit benefit 

the effective income tax rate for 2016  was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2015  primarily due to benefits associated with the impact of settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions in 2015 the lapping of a discrete benefit relating to 

certain foreign taxes that became eligible to be claimed as credits in the united states in 2015 and a higher us foreign tax credit benefit associated with the repatriation of current year foreign earnings in 2015 these items were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings in 2016 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35  to pretax income for the years ended december 31  as a result of the following 



1  included within the impact of foreign tax credits are repatriation benefits of current year foreign earnings of 0 million  116 million  and 172 million  in addition to other foreign tax credit benefits which become eligible in the united states of 27 million  25 million  and 109 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

our gaap effective income tax rates for 2017  2016  and 2015  were affected by the tax benefits related to the special items as previously discussed 

as of december 31 2017  a provisional amount of the us federal and state and local income taxes of 36 million  has been provided on a substantial amount of our undistributed foreign earnings this deferred tax charge has been established primarily on the estimated foreign exchange gain which will be recognized when such earnings are repatriated we expect that foreign withholding taxes associated with these future repatriated earnings will not be material based upon the ongoing review of business requirements and capital needs of our nonus subsidiaries we believe a portion of these undistributed earnings that have already been subject to tax in the us will be necessary to fund current and future growth of the related businesses and will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the us in 2018 we will complete our analysis of global working capital and cash needs to determine the amount we consider indefinitely reinvested we will disclose such amount in the period in which such analysis is completed as well as if practicable any potential tax cost that would arise if the amounts were remitted back to the us 

our unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior periods were 183 million  and 169 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively all of which would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion within the next twelve months we believe that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local tax examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire during 2015 our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods decreased by 183 million  this decrease was primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions further the information gained related to these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled 

during 2014 we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the us this initiative resulted in a onetime taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom we believe this improved alignment has resulted in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of our operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region our subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we rely on existing liquidity cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations credit and settlement exposure capital expenditures investments in our business and current and potential obligations the following table summarizes the cash cash equivalents investments and credit available to us at december 31  



1  investments include availableforsale securities and shortterm heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2017  and 2016  this amount excludes restricted cash related to the us merchant class litigation settlement of 546 million  and 543 million  respectively this amount also excludes restricted security deposits held for customers of 1 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  

cash cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was 48 billion  and 38 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively or 62  and 45  as of such dates as described further in note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 as a result of the enactment of the tcja among other things we recorded a provisional amount of 629 million  in tax expense due to the transition tax which is payable over the next 8 years  in addition we have changed our assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the us for certain of our foreign affiliates as a result of this assertion change we have recognized a provisional deferred tax liability of 36 million  it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest a portion of our historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with certain foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states based upon the ongoing review of business requirements and capital needs of our nonus subsidiaries we believe a portion of these undistributed earnings that have already been subject to tax in the us will be necessary to fund current and future growth of the related businesses and will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the us in 2018 we will complete our analysis of global working capital and cash needs to determine the amount we consider indefinitely reinvested we will disclose such amount in the period in which such analysis is completed as well as if practicable any potential tax cost that would arise if the amounts were remitted back to the us 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions we guarantee the settlement of many mastercard cirrus and maestrobranded transactions between our issuers and acquirers see note 19 settlement and other risk management  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for a description of these guarantees historically payments under these guarantees have not been significant however historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions including but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region 

our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a and note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and part ii item 7 business environment

net cash provided by operating activities increased 10 billion  in 2017  versus 2016  primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for noncash items including deferred payments associated with the tcja net cash provided by operating activities in 2016  versus 2015  increased by 434 million  primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for noncash items and accrued expenses partially offset by higher prepaid taxes

the table below shows a summary of select balance sheet data at december 31  



we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and investment securities balances our cash flow generating capabilities our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs capital asset purchases outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations 

debt and credit availability 

our longterm debt was 54 billion  and 52 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively with the earliest maturity of principal occurring in 2019 

we have a commercial paper program the “commercial paper program” under which we are authorized to issue up to 375 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance in conjunction with the commercial paper program we have entered into a committed unsecured 375 billion  revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires in october 2022 

borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in addition we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31 2017  and 2016  

see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion on the notes the commercial paper program and the credit facility 

in june 2015 we filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital if needed pursuant to the shelf registration statement we may from time to time offer to sell debt securities preferred stock class a common stock depository shares purchase contracts units or warrants in one or more offerings 

dividends and share repurchases 

we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock subject to legally available funds we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs the following table summarizes the annual per share dividends paid in the years reflected 



on december 4 2017 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 025  per share paid on february 9 2018 to holders of record on january 9 2018 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend was 263 million  

on february 5 2018 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 025  per share payable on may 9 2018 to holders of record on april 9 2018 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be 263 million  

repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the operating needs of the business legal requirements price and economic and market conditions in december 2017 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 4 billion  of our class a common stock this program is effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in december 2016 

the following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations of its class a common stock through december 31 2017  as well as historical purchases 



see note 13 stockholders’ equity  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2017  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



1  the table does not include the 709 million  provision as of december 31 2017  related to litigation in the us and the uk since the payments are not fixed and determinable see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion the table also does not include the 219 million  provision as of december 31 2017  related to the contingent consideration attributable to acquisitions made in 2017 primarily based on the achievement of 2018 revenue targets which are not fixed and determinable see note 5 fair value and investment securities  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

2  amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance we have accrued 33 billion  as of december 31 2017  related to customer and merchant agreements 

3  amounts relate to severance liabilities along with expected funding requirements for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 

4  amounts relate to the provisional us tax liability on the transition tax on accumulated nonus earnings of us entities see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

5  amount relates to the fixedprice put option for the vocalink remaining shareholders to sell their ownership interest to mastercard on the third and fifth anniversaries of the transaction and quarterly thereafter see note 2 acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

6  we have recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 183 million  at december 31 2017  within the next twelve months we believe that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local examinations are reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 

seasonality 

we do not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2017  2016  or 2015  accounted for more than 30  of net revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to its financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers’ performance in order to recognize this revenue rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates we consider various factors in estimating customer performance including a review of specific transactions historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance if our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance net revenue may be materially different 

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

income taxes 

in calculating our effective income tax rate we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions through our interpretation of local tax regulations adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 

we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained 

and if so how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements if upon examination we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situations we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 

we have changed our assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the us for certain of our foreign affiliates as a result of the tcja and the onetime deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings a provisional amount of us federal and state and local income taxes have been provided on all of our undistributed foreign earnings future distributions from foreign affiliates from earnings which have not already been taxed in the us will be eligible for a 100 dividends received deduction beginning in 2018 deferred taxes will be established on the estimated foreign exchange gains or losses for foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested which will be recognized through cumulative translation adjustments as incurred ultimately the working capital requirements of foreign affiliates will determine the amount of cash to be remitted from respective jurisdictions 

on december 22 2017 sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118  income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a measurement period which is not to extend beyond one year accordingly amounts recorded may require further adjustments due to evolving analysis and interpretations of law including issuance by the internal revenue service the “irs” and the department of treasury “treasury” of notices regulations and potentially direct discussions with treasury as well as interpretations of how accounting for income taxes should be applied to the tcja consistent with sab 118 we were able to make reasonable estimates and we have incorporated provisional amounts for the impact of the transition tax this tax is on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries to compute the tax we must determine the amount of post1986 earnings and profits of relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings further we were able to make reasonable estimates and have recorded provisional amounts related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset in the us and the change in assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings as with the transition tax these amounts may require further adjustments during the measurement period due to evolving analysis and interpretations of law including issuance by the irs and treasury of notices and regulations and potentially direct discussions with treasury as well as interpretations of how accounting for income taxes should be applied 

valuation of assets 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing a quantitative assessment we use the market capitalization for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment charge 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets in performing the qualitative assessment we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events and legal and regulatory factors if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

our estimates in the valuation of these assets are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 




 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately 109 million  on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2017  related to the hedging program a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investments at december 31 2017  and 2016  in addition there was no material equity price risk at december 31 2017  or 2016  

foreign exchange risk 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions we enter into foreign currency contracts to manage risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currencies of the entity 

we may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of earnings assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity the objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies principally the us dollar and euro 

foreign currency exposures are managed together through our foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months  

as of december 31 2017  the majority of derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations had been entered into with our customers our derivative contracts are summarized below   



we also use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates with changes in the translated value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we have designated our eurodenominated debt as a net investment hedge for a portion of our net investment in european foreign operations our eurodenominated debt is vulnerable to changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rates the principal amounts of our eurodenominated debt as well as the effective interest rates and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included in note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in fixed income securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of our availableforsale investments for fixed income securities as of december 31  was as follows 





we also have time deposits that are classified as heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2017  and 2016  the cost which approximates fair value of our shortterm heldtomaturity securities was 700 million  and 452 million  respectively in addition at december 31 2016  we held 61 million  of longterm heldtomaturity securities we did not hold any longterm heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2017  

at december 31 2017  we have us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt which is subject to interest rate risk the principal amounts of this debt as well as the effective interest rates and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included in note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 see “future obligations” for estimated interest payments due by period relating to the us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt 

at december 31 2017  we have the commercial paper program and the credit facility which provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers borrowing rates under the commercial paper program are based on market conditions borrowing rates under the credit facility are variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for additional information on the credit facility and the commercial paper program we had no borrowings under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31 2017  and 2016

typical transaction    with a typical transaction involving four participants in addition to us our network supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payments network the following diagram depicts a typical transaction on our network and our role in that transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device after the transaction is authorized by the issuer the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and then posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” rate as further described below to the merchant

competition 

we compete in the global payments industry against all forms of payment including 

 we face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry 



 our competitive advantages include our 



government regulation 

general    government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards and payment devices are used see “risk factors” in part i item 1a for more detail and examples 

interchange fees   interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation and litigation examples include statutes in the united states that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities european union legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the eea and interchange regulations by the reserve bank of australia for more detail see our risk factors in “risk factorspayments system legal and regulatory challenges” in part i item 1a also see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

payments system regulation    regulators in several countries around the world either have or are seeking to establish authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in their countries such authority has resulted in regulation of various aspects of our business including interchange fees in various jurisdictions described above and nosurcharging rules in the european union legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities brand products franchise and licensing from our switched transactions and other processing in terms of how we go to market make decisions and organize our structure additionally several jurisdictions have created or granted authority to create new regulatory bodies that either have or would have the authority to regulate payment systems including the united kingdom’s payments systems regulator psr which has designated us as a payments system subject to regulation and the national bank of belgium 

preferential or protective government actions   some governments have taken action to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers as well as to create their own national providers 

nosurcharge rules   we have historically implemented policies in certain regions that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means authorities in several jurisdictions including australia and canada have acted to end or limit the application of these nosurcharge rules or have indicated interest in doing so additionally pursuant to the terms of settlement of the us merchant class litigation we have modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations 

payments oversight    several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry in some cases these regulators could designate certain payments networks as “systemically important payment systems” or “critical infrastructure” this includes the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” in the united states designated systems will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements to date mastercard has not been designated “systemically important” however certain jurisdictions have begun to employ elements of “systemically important” analysis in their review of mastercard licenses or other applications and may increasingly do so in the future 

financial sector oversight   we are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers for example certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers additionally the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which has significant federal authority to regulate consumer financial products in the united states has supervisory authority over companies such as mastercard that provide services to financial institutions that are subject to the cfpb and that issue and acquire our consumer credit deposit payment and similar products 

data protection and information security   aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere around the world for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program due to constant changes to the nature of data regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux this includes the 2016 general data protection regulation gdpr passed by the european parliament the 2015 ruling by the european court of justice that invalidated the euus safe harbor treaty and the euus privacy shield 

antimoney laundering   mastercard is subject to antimoney laundering “aml” laws and regulations including the usa patriot act we have implemented a comprehensive aml program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity our aml compliance program is comprised of policies procedures and internal controls including the designation of a compliance officer and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks 

economic sanctions    we are subject to regulations imposed by the us office of foreign assets control “ofac” restricting financial transactions and other dealings with crimea cuba iran north korea sudan and syria and with persons and entities included in ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states we have no offices subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries or in the crimea region and do not license entities domiciled there we have established a riskbased compliance program that includes policies procedures and controls that are designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries regions individuals or entities this includes obligating issuers and acquirers to screen cardholders and merchants respectively against the sdn list 

issuer practice regulation    our customers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in their capacity as issuers and otherwise impacting mastercard as a consequence such regulations and investigations have been related to campus cards bank overdraft practices fees issuers charge to cardholders and the transparency of terms and conditions additionally regulations such as psd2 in europe require financial institutions to provide new thirdparty processors and other service providers access to consumer account information at financial institutions enabling them to initiate a transaction directly with consumers 

regulation of internet and digital transactions    various jurisdictions have enacted or have proposed regulation related to internet transactions for example under the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act in the united states payment transactions must be coded and blocked for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payments system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is implemented through a federal regulation we may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling including fantasy sports certain jurisdictions are also considering regulatory initiatives in digitalrelated areas that could impact us such as cybersecurity copyright and trademark infringement and privacy 

additional regulatory developments   various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us including evolving laws surrounding marijuana prepaid payroll cards virtual currencies payment card addon products identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly

 item 1a risk factors 

  

legal and regulatory 

payments systems challenges 

global regulatory legislative and litigation focus on the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of payment cards although we do not earn revenues from interchange interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our cards if interchange rates are too high merchants may stop accepting our products or route debit transactions away from our network if interchange rates are too low issuers may stop promoting our cards eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other cardholder benefits eg free checking low interest rates on balances or charge fees to cardholders eg annual fees or late payment fees 

historically we have set interchange rates in the united states and certain other countries in some jurisdictions such as the united states and the european union however interchange rates related to certain products and related practices are subject to regulatory activity and litigation that have limited our ability to establish these rates regulators legislatures and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation competition and central bank regulation and litigation 

more broadly regulators increasingly have been seeking to establish or expand their authority to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours beyond just interchange rates these regulations have established and could further expand obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to financial institutions for consumers the 

countries in which our products and services may be used the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards these obligations and restrictions may further increase and could conflict as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payment systems 

examples of regulatory and legislative activity related to interchange fees and payments systems include 

 merchants and consumers are also seeking interchange fee reductions and acceptance rule changes through litigation such litigation includes individual andor class action suits filed by merchants against mastercard visa and our customers in the united states where approval of a 2012 settlement agreement was overturned by the us court of appeals in 2016 and canada claims filed by retailers against mastercard in the united kingdom and other european jurisdictions and a collective action filed by consumers in the united kingdom see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding litigation and regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to interchange fees 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange rates issuers may be less willing to participate in our fourparty payments system or may reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products reducing the attractiveness of our products to consumers in particular any changes to our interregional interchange fees as a result of the european commission’s statement of objections could impact our crossborder transaction activity disproportionately versus competitors that are not subject to similar reductions these and other impacts could lower transaction volumes andor make proprietary threeparty networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could reduce the benefits associated with our products or choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services in addition issuers could seek to decrease the expense of their card and other payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on mastercard than on our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge this could make our products less desirable to consumers reduce the volume of transactions and our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products 

we are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have a more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to its competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates any resulting legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages the amount of which could be material 

additionally increased focus on regulation of payment systems may result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance moreover failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation in order to successfully compete in such an environment we and our customers would each need to adjust our strategies accordingly  

limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have historically implemented policies referred to as nosurcharge rules in certain jurisdictions including the united states that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these nosurcharge rules or indicated interest in doing so additionally we have modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations it is possible that over time merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change this could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably andor using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

current regulatory activity could be extended to additional jurisdictions or products which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries in some areas such as interchange fees we believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on their approaches consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions for example a decision in europe related to interchange fees could increase the possibility of additional competition authorities in european member states opening interchange fee proceedings similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product may lead lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations affecting debit transactions could lead to regulation of other products such as credit 

as a result the risks to our business created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involve other products these include matters like interchange rates potential direct regulation of mastercard’s network fees and pricing network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business to meet the varying requirements either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

preferential or protective government actions 

preferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries such as china russia and india have acted or in the future may act to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and processing providers or have created or may in the future create their own national provider this action may displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers for example 

 such developments prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for domestic or regional customers our efforts to effect change in or work with these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

privacy data protection and security 

regulation of privacy data protection and security could increase our costs as well as negatively impact our growth 

we are subject to regulations related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business these regulations could result in negative impacts to our business as we continue to develop products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace we may expand our information profile through the collection of additional data across multiple channels this expansion could amplify the impact of these regulations on our business regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may require changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information in addition due to the european parliament’s passage of the general data protection regulation and the european court of justice’s invalidation of the safe harbor treaty we are subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirements in the european union failure to comply with these laws regulations and requirements could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

new requirements in these areas either from new regulations or laws or any additions or changes as well as the manner in which they could be interpreted or applied may also increase our costs and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring the development of informationbased products and solutions and technology operations in addition these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products which may in turn decrease the number of our cards and other payment devices that they issue moreover due to account data compromise events as well as the disclosure of the monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

regulation related to our participation in the payments industry 

regulations affecting the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our cards and other devices are used many of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that at times consequently affect us regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “businessgovernment regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation examples include 



jurisdictions or their sympathizers may take similar or other actions in response to sanctions that could negatively impact us 

 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties each may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance andor our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation 

litigation 

liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations including among others those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings in the event we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damages which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements such as changes to our nosurcharge rule in the united states any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could impact our relationships with our customers including reducing the volume of business that we do with them which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

business and operations 

competition and technology 

substantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash and checks electronic mobile and ecommerce payment platforms cryptocurrencies ach payment services and other payments networks which can have several competitive impacts on our business 

 certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate threeparty payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business models 

 if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a fourparty system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not we could lose business to these competitors see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems ecommerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices as well as physical store locations a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business 

as the payments industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risks including 

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our mastercardbranded cards and enabled payment devices we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support that promote our products in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations in addition increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth 

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes which can impact our business in several ways 



 we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

information security and service disruptions 

information security failures or breaches could disrupt our business damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain as well as our cardholders rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control we routinely are subject to cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to cyberattacks because of our position in the payments value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks additionally geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers 

to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as the lack of availability of our valueadded systems as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties in addition they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs to mastercard such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our 

customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

we maintain an information security program a business continuity program and insurance coverage each reviewed by our board of directors and its audit committee and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks we also periodically test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats the prominent size and scale of mastercard and our role in the global payments and technology industries our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and cardholders when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of thirdparty vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities as a result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could materially affect our overall business and results of operations 

our transaction processing systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions fire weather events power outages telecommunications disruptions terrorism workplace violence accidents or other catastrophic events our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists activists or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities andor systems additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations 

financial institution customers and other stakeholder relationships 

losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest financial institution customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 

most of our financial institution customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest financial institution customers loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

exclusivenear exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business 

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation   in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations   

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor if significant consolidation among customers were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for us which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers these developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and in many jurisdictions their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands 

while we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system including merchants governments and large digital companies and other technology companies we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards or other payment devices extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders using our products each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in “risk factors  settlement and thirdparty obligation risk” in this part i item 1a with respect to how we guarantee certain thirdparty obligations for further discussion 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payments system among consumers in these countries we also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries alongside our own relationships with them from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations 

merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

merchants are important constituents in our payments system we rely on both our relationships with them as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers to continue to expand the acceptance of our cards and payment devices we also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels create better purchase experiences improve efficiencies increase revenues and fight fraud in the retail industry there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard has been defending including the us merchant litigations see our risk factor in this part i item 1a with respect to payments industry regulation including interchange fees the continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payments may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards and devices we also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create cobranded payment programs with us as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives additionally if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer 

our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 

as we increase our work with national state and local governments both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 settlement and thirdparty obligations 

our role as guarantor exposes us to risk of loss or illiquidity 

we are a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of 

 in this capacity we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity 

 our gross settlement exposure for our brands was approximately 37 billion  as of december 31 2016  

we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day including the availability of our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program and we are able to seek assignment of underlying receivables from a failed customer and may charge customers for settlement losses incurred during mastercard’s ordinary course activities we also minimize the contingent risk of a settlement failure using various strategies including monitoring our customers’ financial condition their economic and political operating environments and their compliance with our participation standards however the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited as a result 



financial institution customers in general are directly and indirectly impacted by economic conditions in global financial markets these conditions subject us to risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices see note 19 settlement and other risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

separately mastercard also provides guarantees to certain customers and other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from our failure to perform with respect to our products and services or the failure of third parties to perform should an event occur that would trigger any significant indemnification obligation which we owe to any such customers or other companies such an obligation could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

global economic and political environment 

global financial market activity could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following 

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

a decline in crossborder activity could adversely affect our results of operations 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and fees related to switched transactions revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases additionally any regulation of interregional interchange fees could negatively impact our crossborder activity which could decrease the revenue we receive any such decline in crossborder activity could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

negative trends in consumer spending could negatively impact our results of operations 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our payment cards and devices also as we are headquartered in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations 

during 2016  approximately 62  of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies 

in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar if the us dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars 

the occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

reputational impact 

negative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” additionally large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers use our network to build their own acceptance brands which could cause consumer confusion and decrease the value of our brand moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances our use of social media or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us or our products such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business 

account data breaches could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

we our issuers and acquirers merchants and other third parties process transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards and devices in addition our customers may sponsor or we may certify as pcicompliant thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage our reputation and lead to claims against us as well as subject us to regulatory actions we routinely encounter account data compromise events some of which have been high profile involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affect millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of cardholders these events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants’ or thirdparty processors’ systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems further data security breaches may subject us to reputational damage andor lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices as well as the trend toward electronic payments which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes results of operations and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

in addition to reputational concerns while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers we could still face damage claims which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

fraudulent activity could damage our reputation and encourage regulatory intervention which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud cards that use magneticstripe technology still widely used in the united states continue to raise heightened vulnerabilities to fraud relative to other technologies due to the static nature of the information on the magnetic stripe fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as online commerce which constitutes an increasing percentage of transactions in addition as outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards while we are taking measures to mitigate risks associated with magnetic stripes via increased migration to emv and making digital payments more secure through mdes increased fraud levels involving our cards or misconduct or negligence by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation these occurrences could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

acquisitions 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation 

although we may continue to evaluate andor make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them despite original intentions and focused efforts in addition such an integration may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition 

any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply this compliance could increase our costs and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage 

class a common stock and governance structure 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions and have an impact on changeincontrol 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power in addition 



the foundation’s substantial stock ownership and restrictions on its sales may impact corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to or favored by the other public stockholders 

as of february 10 2017  the foundation owned 112834232  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 107  of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to april 26 2026 except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements for which purpose earlier sales are permitted the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders

issuer purchases of equity securities 

on december 8 2015 the company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 4 billion  of its class a common stock the “december 2015 share repurchase program” this program became effective in february 2016 on december 6 2016 the company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 4 billion  of its class a common stock the “december 2016 share repurchase program” this program will become effective after completion of the december 2015 share repurchase program

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” together “mastercard” or the “company” included elsewhere in this report in the fourth quarter of 2016 the company began using the term “switched” transactions instead of “processed” transactions to differentiate our authorization clearing and settlement activities from our issueracquirer processing activities this change only relates to terminology no previously reported amounts have changed percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand 

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” see “overview” for the tables that provide reconciliations of the nongaap operating results and growth to the most directly comparable gaap measures this report contains nongaap financial measures that exclude the impact of the following special items “special items” 

 the provisions for litigation for both years discussed above relate to separate merchant litigations in the uk collectively the “uk merchant litigation provision” see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion mastercard excluded the uk merchant litigation provision because its management monitors material litigation judgments and settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts the company also excluded the us employee pension plan settlement charge because its management monitors significant onetime items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts for additional discussion regarding the us employee pension plan settlement charge see note 11 pension postretirement and savings plans  in part ii item 8 

mastercard presents growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency which is a nongaap financial measure for 2016 the company presents currencyneutral growth rates which are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results prior to 2016 the impact of foreign currency on our operating results were presented to include only translational impacts the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our us dollar reporting currency the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency mastercard’s management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information 

mastercard’s management believes that the nongaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of mastercard’s operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods mastercard’s management uses nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 

overview 

the following tables provide a summary of our operating results   





note tables may not sum due to rounding 

1   see “nongaap financial information” for further information on special items 

we recorded net income of 41 billion  or 369  per diluted share in 2016  versus net income of 38 billion  or 335  per diluted share in 2015  net income and diluted earnings per share increased 7  and 10  respectively in 2016  versus 2015  

excluding the impact of special items we had adjusted net income of 41 billion  or 377  per adjusted diluted share in 2016  versus adjusted net income of 39 billion  or 343  per adjusted diluted share in 2015 adjusted net income increased 6  or 7  on a currencyneutral basis in 2016  versus 2015  in addition adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 10  or 11  on a currencyneutral basis in 2016  versus 2015  

key highlights for 2016  were as follows 

 other financial highlights for 2016  were as follows 

 business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210  countries and territories and in more than 150  currencies net revenue generated in the united states was 38  of total revenue in 2016  and 39  in 2015  and 2014  respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenue in any such period but differences in market growth economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate certain of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in addition political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry notwithstanding recent encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business 

for a full discussion of the various legal regulatory and business risks that could impact our financial results see “risk factors” in part i item 1a 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our us dollar reporting currency 

our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume “gdv” and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volumerelated rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volumerelated rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies for example our billing in australia is in the us dollar however consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our us dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollarconverted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2016  gdv on a us dollarconverted basis increased 6  while gdv on a local currency basis increased 9  versus 2015  in 2015  gdv on a us dollarconverted basis increased 2  while gdv on a local currency basis increased 13  versus 2014  further the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency 

the following table provides a summary of the foreign currency impact on growth for the following items in operating results for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015    



  

1 excludes the impact from special items 

2 represents the foreign currency translational and transactional impact versus 2015 

3 represents the foreign currency translational impact versus 2014 

in addition the company incurs foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts “foreign exchange 

activity” the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currencyneutral results see “nongaap financial information” and is recorded in general and administrative expenses the company attempts to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through its foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize 

the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the us dollar 

financial results 

revenue 

revenue description 

mastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders merchants issuers the cardholders’ financial institutions and acquirers the merchants’ financial institutions our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated products and services our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro and brazilian real 

the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following 

 the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories 



 revenue analysis 

gross revenue in 2016  and 2015  increased 14  and 7  versus 2015  and 2014  respectively the increases in 2016  versus 2015  and 2015  versus 2014  were primarily driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity and number of transactions on cards carrying our brands as well as growth in our advisors business which includes the impact of our data analytics business acquired in 2015 partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation and the foreign currency impact on local billing 

rebates and incentives in 2016  and 2015  increased 20  for both periods versus 2015  and 2014  the increases in rebates and incentives in 2016  versus 2015  and 2015  versus 2014  were primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation 

our net revenue in 2016  and 2015  increased 11  and 2  versus 2015  and 2014  respectively 

the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

in 2016 our gdv was impacted by new eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments the regulation was effective in june 2016 and required that we no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use our network brand prior to that mastercard collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries particularly france on transactions with mastercard cobadged cards if the brands of domestic networks as opposed to mastercard were used as a result the nonmastercard cobadged volume is no longer being included   

the following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard for comparability purposes we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 of the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments to exclude the prior period cobadged volume processed by other networks 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2016  the net revenue from these customers was approximately 25 billion  or 23  of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see our risk factor in “risk factor  business risks” in part i item 1a for further discussion 

the significant components of our net revenue were as follows 



the following table summarizes the primary drivers of net revenue growth

general and administrative expenses increased 11  in 2016  versus 2015  and increased 6  in 2015  versus 2014  excluding the impact of the us employee pension plan settlement charge adjusted general and administrative expenses increased 14  in 2016  versus 2015  and increased 3  in 2015  versus 2014  in 2016 adjusted general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel cost and the lapping of the impact of foreign exchange activity gains in 2015 partially offset by improved cost controls in 2015 the increase was due to acquisitions and higher data processing costs partially offset by improved cost controls the favorable impact of foreign currency translation lapping of the impact of the restructuring charge taken in 2014 and foreign exchange activity gains 

the significant components of our general and administrative expenses were as follows 



note table may not sum due to rounding 

 not meaningful 

1  see “nongaap financial information” for further information on special items 

the primary drivers of changes in general and administrative expenses in 2016  and 2015  were 



 advertising and marketing 

in 2016  advertising and marketing expenses decreased 1  versus 2015  mainly due to lower sponsorship promotions in the current year advertising and marketing expenses decreased 5  in 2015  mainly due to the favorable impact from foreign currency translation and lower media spend partially offset by higher sponsorship promotions to support our strategic initiatives see valueadded solutions and marketing sections included in part i item 1 for further discussion of our marketing strategy 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 2  in 2016  versus 2015  and increased 14  in 2015  versus 2014  the increase in 2016  was primarily due to higher depreciation from capital investments partially offset by certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2015  the increase was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs and other intangibles associated with our acquisitions 

provision for litigation settlements 

during 2016  and 2015  the company recorded pretax charges of 117 million  and 61 million  respectively related to litigations with merchants in the uk see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses total other expense decreased to 115 million  in 2016  versus 120 million  in 2015  due to lower impairment charges taken on certain investments and higher investment income in 2016  partially offset by higher interest expense from debt issued in 2015  and 2016  total other expense increased in 2015  versus 2014  primarily due to impairment charges taken on certain investments in 2015  and higher interest expense resulting from incremental debt issued in 2014  and 2015  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  were 281  232  and 288  respectively 

the effective income tax rate for 2016  was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2015  primarily due to benefits associated with the impact of settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions in 2015 the lapping of a discrete benefit relating to 

certain foreign taxes that became eligible to be claimed as credits in the united states in 2015 and a higher us foreign tax credit benefit associated with the repatriation of current year foreign earnings in 2015  these items were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings in 2016 

the effective income tax rate for 2015  was lower than the effective income tax rate for 2014  primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions further the information gained related to these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled in addition the recognition of other us foreign tax credits and a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings also contributed to the lower effective tax rate in 2015  

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35  to pretax income for the years ended december 31 as a result of the following 



1   included within the impact of foreign tax credits were repatriation benefits of current year foreign earnings of 116 million  172 million  and 177 million  in addition to other foreign tax credit benefits which become eligible in the united states of 25 million  109 million  and 6 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the company’s gaap effective income tax rates for 2016  and 2015  were affected by the tax benefits related to the special items as previously discussed 

as of december 31 2016  the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were 169 million  all of which would reduce the company’s effective tax rate if recognized see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion within the next twelve months we believe that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local tax examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire during 2015  the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods decreased by 183 million  this decrease was primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions further the information gained related to these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the us this initiative resulted in a onetime taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom we believe this improved alignment will result in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of the company’s operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region the company’s subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance see note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations credit and settlement exposure capital expenditures investments in our business and current and potential obligations the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations the following table summarizes the cash cash equivalents investments and credit available to the company at december 31 



1  investments include availableforsale securities and shortterm heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2016  and 2015  this amount excludes restricted cash related to the us merchant class litigation settlement of 543 million  and 541 million  respectively this amount also excludes restricted security deposits held for customers of 991 million  and 895 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

cash cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to us tax upon repatriation was 38 billion  and 33 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively or 45  and 48  as of such dates it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2016  outside of the united states as disclosed in note 17 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings if these earnings are needed for us operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states the company would be required to record a liability for such us taxes for the historic undistributed accumulated earnings at that time such taxes would be due upon repatriation of such earnings to the united states 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard cirrus and maestrobranded transactions between our issuers and acquirers see note 19 settlement and other risk management  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for a description of these guarantees historically payments under these guarantees have not been significant however historical trends may not be an indication of the future the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions including but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region 

our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a and note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and part ii item 7 business environment for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

cash flow 

the table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities increased 441 million  in 2016  versus 2015  primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for noncash items and accrued expenses partially offset by higher prepaid taxes net cash provided by operating activities in 2015  versus 2014  increased by 636 million  primarily due to lower prepaid taxes and higher net income partially offset by timing of customer settlements 

net cash used in investing activities increased 452 million  in 2016  versus 2015  primarily due to lower sales and maturities of our investment securities partially offset by cash used for acquisition activities in the prior year the 14 billion  decrease in investing activities in 2015  versus 2014  was primarily due to the higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities in 2014  

net cash used in financing activities decreased 165 million  in 2016  versus 2015  primarily due to higher proceeds from debt partially offset by higher dividends paid net cash used in financing activities increased 119 million  in 2015  versus 2014  primarily due to higher dividends paid and an increase in purchases of treasury stock in 2015  partially offset by increased proceeds from debt in 2015  

the table below shows a summary of select balance sheet data at december 31 



the company believes that its existing cash cash equivalents and investment securities balances its cash flow generating capabilities its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs capital asset purchases outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential obligations 

debt and credit availability 

in november 2016 the company issued 650 million  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2021 750 million  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2026 and 600 million  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2046 collectively the “2016 usd notes” including the 2016 usd notes our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2016  was 5239 million  collectively the “notes” the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the notes the notes are senior unsecured obligations and would rank equally with any future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the proceeds of the notes are being used for general corporate purposes

borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company’s customers in addition the company may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes mastercard had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31 2016  and 2015  

see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion on the notes the commercial paper program and the credit facility 

in june 2015 the company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital if needed pursuant to the shelf registration statement the company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities preferred stock class a common stock depository shares purchase contracts units or warrants in one or more offerings 

dividends and share repurchases 

mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock subject to legally available funds we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs the following table summarizes the annual per share dividends paid in the years reflected 



on december 6 2016 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 022  per share paid on february 9 2017 to holders of record on january 9 2016 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend was 238 million  

on february 7 2017 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 022  per share payable on may 9 2017 to holders of record on april 7 2017 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be 237 million  

shares in the company’s common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the operating needs of the business legal requirements price and economic and market conditions in december 2016 the company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 4 billion  of its class a common stock this program will become effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in december 2015 

the following table summarizes the company’s share repurchase authorizations of its class a common stock through december 31 2016  as well as historical purchases 



see note 13 stockholders’ equity  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

mastercard has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2016  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



1  the table does not include the 722 million  provision as of december 31 2016  related to litigation in the us and the uk since the payments are not fixed and determinable see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

2  included in the payments due in 2017 is £700 million  approximately 860 million  as of december 31 2016  related to a definitive agreement for the company to acquire a controlling interest in vocalink holdings limited “vocalink” see note 2 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion additional amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance we have accrued 27 billion  as of december 31 2016  related to customer and merchant agreements 

3  amounts relate to severance liabilities along with expected funding requirements for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 

4  the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 169 million  at december 31 2016  within the next twelve months the company believes that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local examinations are reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2016  2015  or 2014  accounted for more than 30  of net revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the application of us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the company’s reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors the company’s significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers’ performance in order to recognize this revenue rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction 

to gross revenue based on these estimates we consider various factors in estimating customer performance including a review of specific transactions historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions differences between actual results and the company’s estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance if our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance net revenue may be materially different 

loss contingencies 

the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

income taxes 

in calculating our effective income tax rate we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions through our interpretation of local tax regulations adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 

we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and if so how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements if upon examination we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situations the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 

we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations we consider business plans planning opportunities and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 

valuation of assets 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level the impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a twostep impairment test the first step is to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value including goodwill to the fair value the company uses its market capitalization for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value then no potential impairment is considered to exist if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step 

is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets in performing the qualitative assessment we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events and legal and regulatory factors if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts the company must perform a quantitative impairment test 

the company’s estimates in the valuation of these assets are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 




 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately 80 million  on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2016  related to the hedging program a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company’s investments at december 31 2016  and 2015  in addition there was no material equity price risk at december 31 2016  or 2015  

foreign exchange risk 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions we enter into derivative contracts to manage risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currencies of the entity 

we may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of earnings assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity the objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies principally the us dollar and euro 

foreign currency exposures are managed together through our foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months  

as of december 31 2016  the majority of derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations had been entered into with customers of mastercard mastercard’s derivative contracts are summarized below   



we also use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates with changes in the value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we have designated our eurodenominated debt as a net investment hedge for a portion of our net investment in european foreign operations our eurodenominated debt is vulnerable to changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rates the principal amounts of our eurodenominated debt as well as the effective interest rates 

and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included in note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in fixed income securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the company’s availableforsale investments for fixed income securities as of december 31  was as follows 





we also have time deposits that are classified as heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2016  and 2015  the cost which approximates fair value of our shortterm heldtomaturity securities was 452 million  and 130 million  respectively in addition at december 31 2016  the company held 61 million  of longterm heldtomaturity securities which mature in 2018 

at december 31 2016  we have us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt which is subject to interest rate risk the principal amounts of this debt as well as the effective interest rates and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included in note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 see “future obligations” for estimated interest payments due by period relating to the us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt 

at december 31 2016  we have the commercial paper program and the credit facility which provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers borrowing rates under the commercial paper program are based on market conditions borrowings rates under the credit facility are variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for additional information on the credit facility and the commercial paper program we had no borrowings under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at december 31 2016  and 2015

see part i item 1a for a more detailed discussion of our legal and regulatory developments and risks 

our business 

our operations and network 

we operate the mastercard network our unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions permitting mastercard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide our network facilitates an efficient and secure means for merchants to receive payments as well as convenient quick and secure payment method for consumers and businesses that is accepted worldwide we process transactions through our network for our issuer customers in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories 

typical transaction    with a typical transaction involving four participants in addition to us our network supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payments network the following diagram depicts a typical transaction on our network and our role in that transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device after the transaction is authorized by the issuer the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and then posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” rate as further described below to the merchant 

interchange fees   interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants pay we do not earn revenues from interchange fees generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants we or financial institutions establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process 

additional fourparty system fees   the “merchant discount rate” is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the fourparty system and providing services to merchants the rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer additionally acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate and issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit

payments system regulation    regulators in several countries around the world either have or are seeking to establish authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in their countries such authority could result in regulation of various aspects of our business additionally we are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers for example certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers 

preferential or protective government actions   some governments have taken actions to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers as well as create their own national providers 

nosurcharge rules   we have historically implemented policies in certain regions that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these nosurcharge rules or indicated interest in doing so including in australia and canada additionally pursuant to the terms of settlement of the us merchant class litigation we have modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations 

data protection and information security   aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection laws in the united states the european union and elsewhere for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program due to constant changes to the nature of data regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux this includes the recent ruling by the european court of justice that invalidated the euus safe harbor treaty and the newly announced euus privacy shield 

antimoney laundering   mastercard is subject to antimoney laundering “aml” laws and regulations including the usa patriot act we have implemented a comprehensive aml program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity our aml compliance program is comprised of policies procedures and internal controls including the designation of a compliance officer and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks

consumer financial protection bureau    the consumer financial protection bureau has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the united states including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products 

central bank oversight    several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world that have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry are in some cases considering designating them as “systemically important payment systems” or “critical infrastructure” this includes the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” in the united states such systems will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements to date mastercard has not been designated “systemically important”

 item 1a risk factors 

payments systems legal and regulatory challenges 

global legal regulatory and legislative focus on the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

interchange fees are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards although we do not earn revenues from interchange fees they are a factor on which we compete with other payment providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we see on our cards we have historically set default interchange fees in the united states and certain other countries in some jurisdictions however interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity and litigation that have limited our ability to establish default rates regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries as well as merchants are seeking to reduce these fees through legislation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation andor litigation 

more broadly regulators in several jurisdictions increasingly have been leveraging or seeking to establish the authority to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours these regulations have and could further result in obligations or restrictions with respect to not only interchange fees but also the types of products that we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards and other payment devices may be used the way we structure and operate our business and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards these obligations and restrictions could be further increased as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payment systems 

examples of activity related to interchange fees and payments systems include 

 15 

 additionally merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees and impact acceptance rules through litigation such litigation includes individual andor class action suits filed by merchants against mastercard visa and our customers in the united states and canada as well as claims filed by retailers against mastercard in the united kingdom and other european jusrisdictions see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding litigation proceedings and inquiries related to interchange fees 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees issuers will be unable to use interchange fees to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payments system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary threeparty networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services thereby making our card programs less desirable to consumers and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability in addition issuers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card and other payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them this could also result in less innovation and fewer product offerings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have a more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to its competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees any such legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

additionally increased focus by jurisdictions on regulating payment systems may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance moreover failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation in order to successfully compete in such an environment we and our customers would each need to adjust our strategies accordingly 

limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have historically implemented policies referred to as nosurcharge rules in certain regions including the united states that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these nosurcharge rules or indicated interest in doing so additionally pursuant to the terms of settlement of the us merchant class litigation we have modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations it is possible that over time merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change this could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably andor using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

current regulatory activity could be extended to additional jurisdictions or products which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries in some areas such as interchange fees we believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on their approaches consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions for example a decision in europe related to interchange fees could increase the possibility of additional competition authorities in european member states opening interchange fee proceedings similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations affecting debit transactions could lead to regulation of other products such as credit 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involving other products affecting our business these include matters like interchange rates network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business with the same effect either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

preferential or protective government actions 

preferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries such as china russia and india have acted or in the future may act to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and processing providers or have created or may in the future create their own national provider this action may displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers for example 

 such developments would prevent and in russia have prevented us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for domestic or regional customers our efforts to effect change in or work with these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

privacy data protection and security 

regulation of privacy data protection and security could increase our costs as well as negatively impact our growth 

we are subject to regulations related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business these regulations could result in negative impacts to our business as we continue to develop products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace we may expand our information profile through the collection of additional data across multiple channels this expansion could amplify the impact of these regulations on our business regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may require changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information in addition due to the european court of justice’s recent invalidation of the safe harbor treaty we may be subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirements in the european union failure to comply with these laws regulations and requirements could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

new requirements in these areas either from new regulations or laws or any additions or changes as well as the manner in which they could be interpreted or applied may also increase our costs and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring the development of informationbased products and solutions and technology operations in addition these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products which may in turn decrease the number of our cards and other payment devices that they issue moreover due to recent account data compromise events at large usbased retailers as well as the disclosure of the monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirements any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

regulation related to our participation in the payments industry 

regulations affecting the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our cards and other devices are used in particular many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions and consequently we are at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “businessgovernment regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation examples include 

 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties each may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance andor our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation 

competition 

substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash and checks electronic mobile and ecommerce payment platforms cryptocurrencies ach payment services and other payments networks which can have several competitive impacts on our business 

 certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate threeparty payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers these competitors may derive competitive advantages from their business models 

 if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a fourparty system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not we could lose business to these competitors see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems ecommerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices as well as physical store locations a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business 

as the payments industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risks including 

 19 

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our mastercardbranded cards and enabled payment devices we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support that promote our products in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations in addition increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

technology 

rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our results of operations or limit our future growth 

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes which can impact our business in several ways 

 20 

 we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

information security and service disruptions 

information security failures or breaches could disrupt our business damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain as well as our cardholders rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control we routinely are subject to cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to cyberattacks because of our position in the payments value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks additionally geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers 

to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however if one or more of these events occurs it could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services which could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises such events could also cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as the lack of availability of our valueadded systems as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties any actual attacks could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs to mastercard such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

we maintain an information security program a business continuity program and insurance coverage each reviewed by our board of directors and its audit committee and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks we also periodically test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats the prominent size and scale of mastercard and our role in the global payments and technology industries our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and cardholders when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of third 

party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities as a result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could materially affect our results of operations 

our transaction processing systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of a disaster including but not limited to technology malfunctions fire weather events power outages telecommunications disruptions terrorism workplace violence accidents or other catastrophic events our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists activists or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities andor systems a disaster that occurs at or in the vicinity of our primary andor backup facilities in any global location could interrupt our services although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks 

additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially reduce our results of operations 

customers 

losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

exclusivenear exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business 

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation   in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations   

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor if significant consolidation among customers were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for us which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers these developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

stakeholders 

our failure to maintain our relationships with issuers and acquirers may materially and adversely affect our business 

while we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system including merchants governments and large digital companies and other technology companies we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards or other payment devices extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders using our products each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in “risk factors  settlement risk” in this part i item 1a with respect to how we guarantee certain thirdparty obligations for further discussion 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payments system among consumers in these countries we also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries alongside our own relationships with them from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations 

merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

merchants are an important constituency in our payments system we rely on both our relationships with them as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers to continue to expand the acceptance of our cards and payment devices we also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels create better purchase experiences improve efficiencies increase revenues and fight fraud in the retail industry there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard has been defending including the us merchant litigations see our risk factor in this part i item 1a with respect to payments industry regulation including interchange fees the continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payments may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards and devices as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives additionally if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer 

our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 

as we increase our work with national state and local governments both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 23 

 settlement and thirdparty obligation risk 

our role as guarantor exposes us to risk of loss or illiquidity 

as a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of principal customers and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity     

 our gross settlement exposure for our brands was approximately 40 billion  as of december 31 2015  

while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day including the availability of our revolving credit facility are able to seek assignment of underlying receivables from a failed customer and may charge customers for settlement incurred during mastercard’s ordinary course activities the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited as a result 

 these conditions subject us to increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

separately mastercard also provides guarantees to certain customers and other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from our failure to perform with respect to our products and services or the failure of third parties to perform any significant indemnification obligation which we owe to any such customers or other companies could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

global economic and political environment 

global financial market activity could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following 

 24 

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

a decline in crossborder activity could adversely affect our results of operations 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and transaction switching fees revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases any such decline in crossborder activity could adversely affect our results of operations 

negative trends in consumer spending could negatively impact our results of operations 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our payment cards and devices also as we are headquartered in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations 

during 2015  approximately 61  of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies 

in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar if the us dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars 

the occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

reputational impact 

brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” additionally large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers use our network to build their own acceptance brands which could cause consumer confusion and decrease the value of our brand moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances our use of social media or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business 

account data breaches could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

we our issuers and acquirers merchants and other third parties process transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards and devices in addition our customers may sponsor or we may certify as pcicompliant thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage our reputation and lead to claims against us as well as subject us to regulatory actions we routinely encounter account data compromise events some of which have been high profile involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affect millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of cardholders these events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants’ or thirdparty processors’ systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems further data security breaches may subject us to reputational damage andor lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices as well as the trend toward electronic payments which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes results of operations and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

in addition to reputational concerns while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us we could face damage claims in various circumstances which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

fraudulent activity could damage our reputation and encourage regulatory intervention which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud cards that use magneticstripe technology the most widelyused payment technology in the united states continue to raise heightened vulnerabilities to fraud relative to other technologies due to the static nature of the information on the magnetic stripe fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as online commerce which constitutes an increasing percentage of transactions in addition as outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards or misconduct or negligence by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

acquisitions 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation 

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them in addition such an integration may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations 

moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition 

any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions 

litigation 

liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations including among others those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property clams see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings in the event we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damages which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements such as changes to our nosurcharge rule in the united states any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

class a common stock and governance structure 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions and have an impact on changeincontrol 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could be considered antitakeover provisions including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power in addition 

 the foundation’s substantial stock ownership and restrictions on its sales may impact corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to or favored by the other public stockholders 

as of february 4 2016  the foundation owned 115446594  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 106  of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to april 

26 2026 except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements for which purpose earlier sales are permitted the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” together “mastercard” or the “company” included elsewhere in this report certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015  presentation for 2014  and 2013  net revenue and general and administrative expenses were revised to correctly classify 32 million  and 34 million  respectively of customer incentive expenses as contra revenue instead of general and administrative expenses this revision had no impact on net income percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand 

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” this report on form 10k contains nongaap financial measures that exclude the impact of the following special items “special items” 

 mastercard excludes these special items because its management monitors significant onetime items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts mastercard presents nongaap financial measures to enhance an investor’s understanding of mastercard’s ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of its results between periods mastercard’s management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation see “overview” and “financial results” sections for the tables that provide a reconciliation of the operating results and growth to the most directly comparable gaap measure the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 

overview 

we recorded net income of 38 billion  or 335  per diluted share in 2015  versus net income of 36 billion  or 310  per diluted share in 2014  reported net income grew 5  in 2015  versus the comparable period in 2014  

excluding the impact of the special items we had adjusted net income of 39 billion  or 343  per adjusted diluted share in 2015  adjusted net income increased 8  in 2015  versus the comparable period in 2014  the increase in adjusted net income was driven by

 the following tables provide a summary of our operating results

 tables may not sum due to rounding 

business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies net revenue generated in the united states was 39  of total revenue in each of 2015  2014  and 2013  no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenue in any such period but differences in market growth economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate certain of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in addition political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry notwithstanding recent encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business for a full discussion see “risk factors  business risk” in part i item 1a 

in addition our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry for further discussion see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a further information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future see our risk factor in “risk factors  business risks” in part i item 1a related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar during 2015  the euro and the brazilian real devalued against the us dollar by 16 and 28 respectively versus the comparable period in 2014  

the following table provides a summary of the foreign currency translational impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real to our operating results for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014    



in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume “gdv” and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments fees crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives these foreign currency impacts are incremental to the translation impacts discussed above in 

most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus primarily noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies for example our billing in australia is in us dollar however consumer spend in australia is in australian dollar the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our billing currency in us dollars will have an impact on the revenue generated the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2015  gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 1  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 13  in 2014  gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 10  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 13  the company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the us dollar 

financial results 

revenue 

revenue description 

mastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders merchants issuers the cardholders’ financial institutions and acquirers the merchants’ financial institutions our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated products and services our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro and brazilian real 

the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following 

 the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories 

 34 

 revenue analysis 

gross revenue in 2015  and 2014  increased 903 million  and 15 billion  or 7  and 13  versus 2014  and 2013  respectively primarily driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity and number of transactions on cards carrying our brands as well as growth in our advisors business which includes the impact of our newly acquired data analytics business this was partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation and the local foreign currency from billing rebates and incentives in 2015  and 2014  increased 677 million  and 327 million  or 20  and 11  versus 2014  and 2013  respectively due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes partially offset by the positive impact of foreign currency translation our net revenue in 2015  and 2014  increased 2  and 14  versus 2014  and 2013  respectively acquisitions contributed 2  percentage points to net revenue growth in both 2015  and 2014  while foreign currency translation decreased net revenue growth by 6  percentage points and 1  percentage point in 2015  and 2014  respectively 

the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2015  the net revenue from these customers was approximately 23 billion  or 24  of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see our risk factor in “risk factor  business risks” in part i item 1a for further discussion 

the significant components of our net revenue were as follows 



the following table summarizes the primary drivers of net revenue growth 



 not applicable 

1  reflects translation from the euro and brazilian real to the us dollar 

2  includes impact from pricing local foreign currency impact from billing and other fees 

3 includes impact of the allocation of revenue to service deliverables which are recorded in other revenue when services are performed 

4  includes impacts from advisor fees safety and security fees loyalty and reward solution fees and other paymentrelated products and services 

5  includes the impact from timing of new renewed and expired agreements 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing depreciation and amortization expenses and provisions for litigation settlements operating expenses increased 6  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 14  in 2014  compared to 2013  excluding the impact of the special items adjusted operating expenses increased 3  and 17  in 2015  and 2014  respectively primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 6  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 21  in 2014  compared to 2013  

excluding the impact of the special items adjusted general and administrative expenses increased 3  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to acquisitions and higher data processing costs partially offset by improved cost controls the favorable impact of foreign currency translation lapping of the impact of the restructuring charge taken in 2014  and foreign exchange activity gains general and administrative expenses increased 21  in 2014  compared to 2013  due to the impact of investments in our strategic initiatives acquisitions and the restructuring charge of 87 million taken in 2014    

the significant components of our general and administrative expenses were as follows 



1  includes the impact of the us employee pension plan settlement charge which was recognized in personnel expenses see nongaap financial information

 not meaningful 

the primary drivers of changes in general and administrative expenses in 2015  and 2014  were 

 38 

telecommunication system these expenses increased in both 2015  and 2014  due to capacity growth of our business and higher third party processing costs 

 advertising and marketing 

in 2015  advertising and marketing expenses decreased 5  mainly due to the favorable impact from foreign currency translation and lower media spend partially offset by higher sponsorship promotions to support our strategic initiatives advertising and marketing expenses increased 3  in 2014  mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships and increased media spend to support our strategic initiatives see valueadded solutions and marketing sections included in part i item 1 for further discussion of our marketing strategy 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 14  in 2015  and 24  in 2014  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in both 2015  and 2014  was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs and other intangibles associated with our acquisitions 

provision for litigation settlement 

during 2015 the company recorded a pretax charge of 61 million  for a litigation settlement relating to a merchant litigation in the uk in the fourth quarter of 2013 mastercard recorded an incremental net pretax charge of 95 million related to the optout merchants in the us merchant litigation see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses total other expense increased to 120 million  in 2015  versus 27 million  for the comparable period in 2014 resulting from impairment charges taken on certain investments in 2015  and higher interest expense resulting from incremental debt issued in 2014  and 2015  total other expense increased in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in march 2014 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2015  was lower than the effective tax rate for 2014  primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions further the information gained related to the these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled in addition the recognition of other us foreign tax credits and a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings also contributed to the lower effective tax rate in 2015 

the effective tax rate for 2014  was lower than the effective tax rate for 2013  primarily due to the recognition of a larger repatriation benefit and an increase in the company’s domestic production activity deduction in the us related to the company’s authorization revenue partially offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings in 2014  

during the fourth quarter of 2014 we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the us this initiative resulted in a onetime taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom we believe this improved alignment will result in greater 

flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate see note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35  to pretax income for the years ended december 31 as a result of the following 



the company’s gaap effective tax rates for 2015 and 2013 were affected by the tax benefits related to the special items as previously discussed 

during 2015  the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods decreased by 183 million  the decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for 2015  was primarily due to settlements with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions further the information gained related to these matters was considered in measuring uncertain tax benefits recognized for the periods subsequent to the periods settled as of december 31 2015  the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were 181 million  all of which would reduce the company’s effective tax rate if recognized within the next twelve months we believe that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local tax examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of the company’s operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region the company’s subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance see note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations credit and settlement exposure capital expenditures investments in our business and current and potential obligations the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations the following table summarizes the cash cash equivalents investments and credit available to the company at december 31 



1  investments include availableforsale securities and heldtomaturity securities at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  this amount excludes restricted cash related to the us merchant class litigation settlement of 541 million  540 million  and 723 million respectively 

2  other than for business continuity planning we did not use any funds from the line of credit during the periods presented 

cash cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to us tax upon repatriation was 33 billion  and 26 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively or 48  and 42  as of such dates the decrease in cash cash equivalents and investments held by our domestic subsidiaries during 2015 was primarily driven by our use of cash in the us to fund our share repurchases and dividend activity it is our present intention to permanently 

reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015  outside of the united states as disclosed in note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings if these earnings are needed for us operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states the company would be subject to us tax upon repatriation 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard cirrus and maestrobranded transactions between our issuers and acquirers see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for a description of these guarantees historically payments under these guarantees have not been significant however historical trends may not be an indication of the future the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions including but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region 

our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a and note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and part ii item 7 business environment for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

cash flow 

the table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities for 2015  increased 636 million as compared to 2014  primarily due to lower prepaid taxes and higher net income partially offset by timing of customer settlements net cash provided by operating activities for 2014  as compared to 2013  decreased by 728 million primarily due to higher prepaid income taxes associated with our legal entity and tax reorganization 

the 14 billion decrease in investing activities in 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily due to the higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities in the prior year the 694 million increase in investing activity in 2014  as compared to 2013  was primarily due to increased sales of investment securities in 2014  

net cash used in financing activities for 2015  as compared to 2014  increased by 119 million primarily due to higher dividends paid and an increase in purchases of treasury stock in 2015  partially offset by increased proceeds from debt in 2015  net cash used in financing activities in 2014  as compared to 2013  decreased by 290 million primarily due to proceeds from debt issued in 2014  partially offset by higher purchases of treasury stock and dividends in 2014  

the table below shows a summary of the balance sheet data at december 31 



the company believes that its existing cash cash equivalents and investment securities balances its cash flow generating capabilities its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs capital asset purchases outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential obligations 

debt and credit availability 

in december 2015 the company issued €165 billion  aggregate principal amount of notes this offering consisted of €700 million  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2022 €800 million  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2027 and €150 million  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2030 collectively the “euro notes” in march 2014 the company issued 500 million  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2019 and 1 billion  aggregate principal amount of notes due 2024 collectively the “usd notes” the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the euro notes and the usd notes collectively the “notes” the notes are senior unsecured obligations and would rank equally with any future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the proceeds of the notes are to be used for general corporate purposes 

in november 2015 the company established a commercial paper program the “commercial paper program” under the commercial paper program the company is authorized to issue up to 375 billion  in outstanding notes with maturities up to 397  days from the date of issuance in conjunction with the commercial paper program the company entered into a committed unsecured 375 billion  revolving credit facility the “credit facility” in october 2015 which expires in 2020 the credit facility amended and restated the company’s prior credit facility 

borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company’s customers the company may borrow and repay amounts under the commercial paper program and credit facility from time to time for business continuity and planning purposes mastercard had no borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2015  and 2014  as well as had no borrowings under the commercial paper program at december 31 2015  

see note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion on the notes the commercial paper program and the credit facility 

in june 2015 the company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital if needed pursuant to the shelf registration statement the company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities preferred stock class a common stock depository shares purchase contracts units or warrants in one or more offerings 

dividends and share repurchases 

mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock subject to legally available funds we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs the following table summarizes the annual per share dividends paid in the years reflected 



on december 8 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 019  per share paid on february 9 2016 to holders of record on january 8 2016 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend was 212 million  

on february 2 2016 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 019  per share payable on may 9 2016 to holders of record on april 8 2016 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be 211 million 

shares in the company’s common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the operating needs of the business legal requirements price and economic and market conditions in december 2015 the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 4 billion  of its class a common stock this program became effective in february 2016 we typically complete a share repurchase program before a new program becomes effective 

the following table summarizes the company’s share repurchase authorizations of its class a common stock through december 31 2015  as well as historical purchases 



see note 13 stockholders’ equity to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

mastercard has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2015  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



1  the table does not include the 709 million  provision as of december 31 2015  related to the merchant opt outs and the us merchant class litigation since the opt outs are not fixed and determinable and the company has made a payment into escrow to fund the us merchant class litigation see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

2  amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance we have accrued 21 billion as of december 31 2015  related to customer and merchant agreements 

3  amounts relate to severance and expected funding requirements for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 

4  the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 181 million  at december 31 2015  within the next twelve months the company believes that the resolution of certain federal foreign and state and local examinations are reasonably possible and that a change in estimate reducing unrecognized tax benefits may occur it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statute of limitations expire these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2015  2014  or 2013  accounted for more than 30 of net revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the application of us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the company’s reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors the company’s significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers’ performance in order to recognize this revenue rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates we consider various factors in estimating customer performance including a review of specific transactions historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions differences between actual results and the company’s estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance if our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance net revenue may be materially different 

loss contingencies 

the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion 

income taxes 

in calculating our effective tax rate we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions through our interpretation of local tax regulations adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 

we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and if so how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements if upon examination we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situations the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 

we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations we consider business plans planning opportunities and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 

valuation of assets 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level the impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a twostep impairment test the first step is to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value including goodwill to the fair value the company uses a market approach for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value then no potential impairment is considered to exist if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets in performing the qualitative assessment we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events and legal and regulatory factors if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts the company must perform a quantitative impairment test 




 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately 128 million  on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2015  related to the hedging program a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company’s investments at december 31 2015  and 2014  in addition there was no material equity price risk at december 31 2015  or 2014  

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into derivative contracts to manage risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currency we may also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of earnings assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity the objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies principally the us dollar and euro foreign currency exposures are managed together through our foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months 

as of december 31 2015  the majority of derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency fluctuations had been entered into with customers of mastercard mastercard’s derivative contracts are summarized below   



we use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates with changes in the value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss during the fourth quarter of 2015 we designated our eurodenominated debt as a net investment hedge for a portion of our net investment in european foreign operations our eurodenominated debt is vulnerable to changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rates the principal amounts of our eurodenominated debt as well as the effective interest rates and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included in note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the company’s available for sale investments for debt securities as of december 31  was as follows 





at december 31 2015  we have us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt which is subject to interest rate risk the principal amounts of this debt as well as the effective interest rates and scheduled annual maturities of the principal is included 

in note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 see “future obligations” for estimated interest payments due by period relating to the us dollardenominated and eurodenominated debt 

at december 31 2015  we have a credit facility which provides liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company’s customers this credit facility has variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement in conjunction with the credit facility we have established a commercial paper program see note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for additional information on the company’s current and prior credit facilities and commercial paper program with the exception for business continuity planning we did not borrow under the prior or current credit facilities as of december 31 2015  and 2014  and there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program as of december 31 2015

see part i item 1a of this report for a more detailed discussion of our legal and regulatory developments and risks 

our business 

our operations and network    

we operate the mastercard network our unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions permitting mastercard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide our network facilitates an efficient and secure means for merchants to receive payments and a convenient quick and secure payment method for consumers and businesses that is accepted worldwide we process transactions through our network for our issuer customers in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories 

typical transaction  with a typical transaction involving four participants in addition to us our network supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payments network the following diagram depicts a typical transaction on our network and our role in that transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder or an account holder who may not be using a physical card purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device after the transaction is authorized by the issuer the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and then posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” rate as further described below to the merchant 

interchange fees   interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payments system costs among the issuers and acquirers participating in our fourparty payments system they reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants pay we do not earn revenues from interchange fees generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants we or financial institutions establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process 

additional fourparty system fees   the “merchant discount rate” is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the fourparty system and providing services to merchants the rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer additionally acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate and issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit 

our network architecture and information security  the mastercard network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers enabling them to expand into regional and global markets it features an intelligent architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structures 

 our network’s architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring it has 24hour a day availability and worldclass response time the network incorporates multiple layers of protection both for continuity purposes and to address information security challenges we engage in multiple efforts to mitigate such challenges including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities 

participation standards  we establish apply and enforce standards surrounding participation in the mastercard payments system we grant licenses that provide issuers and acquirers that meet specified criteria with certain rights including access to the network and usage of cards and payment devices carrying our brands as a condition of our licenses issuers and acquirers agree to comply with our standards surrounding participation and brand usage and acceptance we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent illegal and branddamaging activity issuers and acquirers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so that we can monitor trends and initiate action when appropriate 

customer risk management  we guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our issuers and acquirers to ensure the integrity of our network we refer to this as our settlement exposure we do not however guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirer or the availability of unspent prepaid cardholder account balances as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of mastercard maestro and cirrus and affiliate debit licensees principal customers participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure of a customer to meet its settlement obligations we monitor the financial health of economic and political operating environments of and compliance with our standards by our customers we employ various strategies to mitigate these risks

 item 1a   risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks 

the payments industry and in particular interchange fees is the subject of significant and intense global legal regulatory and legislative focus and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations   

interchange fees are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards although we do not earn revenues from interchange fees they are a factor on which we compete with other payment providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we see on our cards we have historically set default interchange fees in the united states and certain other countries in some jurisdictions however interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity and litigation that have limited our ability to establish default rates regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries as well as merchants are seeking to reduce these fees through legislation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation andor litigation 

more broadly regulators in several jurisdictions increasingly have been leveraging or seeking to establish the authority to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours these regulations have and could further result in obligations or restrictions with respect to not only interchange fees but also the types of products that we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards and other payment devices may be used the way we structure and operate our business and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards these obligations and restrictions could be further increased as more jurisdictions impose oversight of payment systems 

examples of activity related to interchange fees and the payments system include 

 14 

 additionally merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees and impact acceptance rules through litigation such litigation includes 

 if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees issuers will be unable to use interchange fees to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payments system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary threeparty networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services thereby making our card programs less desirable to consumers and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability in addition issuers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card and other payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them this could also result in less innovation and fewer product offerings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have a more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to its competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees any such legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

additionally increased focus by jurisdictions on regulating payment systems may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance moreover failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation in order to successfully compete in such an environment we and our customers would each need to adjust our strategies accordingly 

new regulatory activity with respect to the payments industry in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations or impact pending regulatory proceedings in other jurisdictions or of other products 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries in some areas such as interchange fees we believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on their approaches consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions for example the european court of justice’s decision in september 2014 upholding the european commission’s decision with respect to crossborder interchange fees within europe has increased the possibility of additional competition authorities in european member states opening proceedings concerning domestic interchange fees as well as the possibility of an adverse outcome for us in related and pending matters similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations affecting debit transactions such as the federal reserve’s rules in the united states could lead to regulation of other consumer products such as credit 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involving other products affecting our business these include matters like interchange rates network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business with the same effect either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

government actions preferring or protecting providers of domestic payment services in certain countries may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries such as china russia ukraine and india could act or have acted to provide resources preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and processing providers or may otherwise create or have created and support its own national provider this action may displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies as an example governments in some countries are considering or may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies in particular russia has amended its national payments systems laws to require all payment systems to process domestic transactions through a governmentowned payment switch in addition regional groups of countries such as the gulf cooperation countries in the middle east are considering or may consider efforts to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transactions such developments would and in russia will prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for domestic or regional customers our efforts to effect change in or work with these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

limitations on our ability to restrict merchants from surcharging credit card transactions could impact the use of electronic payments resulting in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes that could in turn materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have historically implemented policies referred to as nosurcharge rules in certain regions including the united states that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these nosurcharge rules or indicated interest in doing so additionally pursuant to the terms of settlement of the us merchant class litigation we have modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations it is possible that over time merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change which could make credit card programs less desirable to consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the event that such merchants surcharge credit cards this could result in consumers having a less favorable view of our products andor using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards and devices issued and could increase our costs as well as negatively impact our growth 

we are subject to regulations related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business these regulations could result in negative impacts to our business as we continue to develop products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace we may expand our information profile through the collection of additional data across multiple channels this expansion could amplify the impact of these regulations on our business moreover due to recent account data compromise events at large usbased retailers as well as the disclosure of the monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may require changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information failure to comply with the these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation any additions or changes to regulations in these areas as well as the manner in which such laws could be interpreted or applied may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring and the development of informationbased products and solutions in addition these regulations may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment products which may in turn decrease the number of our cards and other payment devices that they issue any of these changes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

our participation in the payments industry subjects us to various other regulations globally that affect the industry which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards and other devices are used in particular many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently we are at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “businessgovernment regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation examples include 

 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties each may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance andor our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation 

liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations   

we are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations including among others those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings in the event we are found liable in any of these material litigations or proceedings particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damages which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements such as changes to our nosurcharge rule in the united states any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

potential changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

potential changes in existing tax laws such as recent proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states including the treatment of earnings of controlled foreign corporations may impact our effective tax rate and tax payments this could adversely impact our results of operations see also note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

business risks   

substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including cash and checks electronic mobile and ecommerce payment platforms and payments networks within the global general purpose payments industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa american express discover unionpay jcb and paypal among others in certain jurisdictions including the united states visa has greater volume scale and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantages moreover some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcomes of litigation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank activity and legislative activity 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate endtoend payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of endtoend payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours in which we must typically rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition even when they operate programs that utilize a fourparty system these competitors have generally not attracted the same level of regulatory or legislative scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a fourparty system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not we could lose business to these competitors see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth our customers can also develop their own competitive services we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems ecommerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices as well as physical store locations a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could 

put us at a competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

potential future changes in the competitive landscape including disintermediation from other participants in the payments value chain also could harm our business   

we expect that there may be future changes in the competitive landscape including 

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

continued intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations   

in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our products in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

continuing consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations    

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor if significant consolidation were to continue in the banking industry it may result in the substantial loss of business for us which could have 

a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business 

consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which we have a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

if we lose a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term which could have a material adverse longterm impact on our business     

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

merchants are an important constituency in our payments system we rely on both our relationships with them as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers to expand the acceptance of our cards and payment devices we also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels create better purchase experiences improve efficiencies increase revenues and fight fraud in the retail industry there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard has been defending including the us merchant litigations see our risk factor in this part i item 1a with respect to payments industry regulation including interchange fees the continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payments may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards and devices as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives 

the exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and may have a material adverse impact on our business   

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers to manage our payments system and our failure to maintain those relationships may materially and adversely affect our business   

while we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system including merchants and governments we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards or other payment devices extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders using our products each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in 

turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in “risk factors  business risks” in this part i item 1a with respect to how we guarantee certain thirdparty obligations for further discussion 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payments system among consumers in these countries we also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries alongside our own relationships with them from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards and other payment devices carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our products and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

the perception of our brands and reputation may materially and adversely affect our overall business   

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to our branded products depends upon the external perception of us and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances our use of social media or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business 

our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 

as we increase our work with national state and local governments both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 21 

the impact of global economic events in financial markets and on our customers merchants and cardholders could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following 

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

a decline in crossborder activity could adversely affect our results of operations   

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and transaction processing fees revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases any such decline in crossborder activity could adversely affect our results of operations 

general economic and global political conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our results of operations   

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending as well as the impact of events in the united states such as deadlines on the debt limit in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our payment cards and devices also as we are headquartered in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business 

as a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of principal customers and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity     

we may incur obligations in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons if a principal customer or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss in addition although we are not obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations or to keep prepaid cardholders whole if an issuer defaults on its obligation to safeguard unspent prepaid funds our mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded gross legal settlement exposure which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 42 billion  as of december 31 2014  we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 3 billion  which could be used for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in the event that mastercard effects a payment on behalf of a failed customer mastercard may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables from the failed customer customers may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during these ordinary course activities of mastercard while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited as a result concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our overall business in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations moreover during 2014  many of our financial institution customers continued to be directly and adversely impacted by economic events in the global financial markets these conditions present increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices as of december 31 2014  see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

separately mastercard also provides guarantees to certain customers and other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from our failure to perform with respect to our products and services or the failure of third parties to perform any significant indemnification obligation which we owe to any such customers or other companies could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

a failure or breach of our information security systems or infrastructure could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain as well as our cardholders rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control we routinely are subject to cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to cyberattacks because of our position in the payments value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks additionally geopolitical events and resulting government activity including sanctions could also lead to information security threats and attacks by jurisdictions affected by such activity or by other actors sympathetic to those jurisdictions 

to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however if one or more of these events occurs it could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services which could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises such events could also cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as the lack of availability of our valueadded systems as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties any actual attacks could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs to mastercard such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

we maintain an information security program that is reviewed by our board of directors a business continuity program and insurance coverage and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks we also test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats the prominent size and scale of mastercard and our role in the global payments and technology industries our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and cardholders when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of thirdparty vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities as a result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

if our transaction processing systems and other services are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions or service our customers efficiently or at all our results of operations would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems and other key service offerings may experience interruptions as a result of a disaster including but not limited to technology malfunctions fire weather events power outages telecommunications disruptions terrorism workplace violence accidents or other catastrophic events our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists activists or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities andor systems a disaster that occurs at or in the vicinity of our primary andor backup facilities in any global location could interrupt our services although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks 

additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially reduce our results of operations 

account data breaches involving card data stored processed or transmitted by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

we our issuers and acquirers merchants and other third parties process transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards and devices in addition our customers may sponsor or we may certify as pcicompliant thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage our reputation and lead to claims against us as well as subject us to regulatory actions we routinely encounter account data compromise events some of which have been high profile involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affect millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of cardholders these events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants’ or thirdparty processors’ systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems further data security breaches may subject us to reputational damage andor lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands while most of these lawsuits do not involve direct claims against us we could face damage claims in various circumstances which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our results of operations damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices as well as the trend toward electronic payments which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes results of operations and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands andor regulatory intervention which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud cards that use magneticstripe technology the predominant payment technology in the united states continue to raise heightened vulnerabilities to fraud relative to other technologies due to the static nature of the 

information on the magnetic stripe fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present which constitutes an increasing number of transactions in addition as outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards or misconduct or negligence by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

rapid technological developments in our industry present both operational and legal challenges including potential intellectual property exposure which could impact our results of operations or limit our future growth   

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless payment devices electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards and by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes by the complexity of our systems our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from patent holders for example other operating companies or nonpracticing entities suggesting that we may be infringing certain patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    failure to keep pace with these technological developments could lead to a decline in the use of our products which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations 

during 2014  approximately 61  of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies 

in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar if the us dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars 

the occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation   

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies in addition the integration of any acquisition or investment including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions 

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure 

our organizational documents and delaware law contain terms and provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions or could have an impact on a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further except in limited circumstances no customer or former customer of mastercard or any operator customer or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 the foundation’s substantial stock ownership and restrictions on its sales may impact its approval of or discourage corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to or favored by the other public stockholders 

as of february 5 2015  the foundation owned 116918728  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 105  of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to april 26 2026 except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements for which purpose earlier sales are permitted the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders

 overview 

we recorded net income of 36 billion  or 310  per diluted share in 2014  versus net income of 31 billion  or 256  per diluted share in 2013  and net income of 28 billion  or 219  per diluted share in 2012  during 2014 net income growth of 16  was driven by higher net revenue and an improved effective tax rate partially offset by increased operating expenses 

our 2014  results were positively impacted by a tax benefit resulting from a repatriation of foreign earnings which was offset by restructuring expenses and the impact of acquisitions in 2013 and 2012 net income was impacted by the increased mdl provisions of 95 million 61 million after tax and 20 million 13 million after tax respectively 

our net revenue increased 14  and 13  in 2014  and 2013  versus the comparable periods in the prior years respectively primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories partially offset by higher rebates and incentives acquisitions contributed 2  percentage points to net revenue growth in 2014  in 2014  and 2013  our processed transactions increased 12  and 13  versus the comparable periods in the prior years respectively in 2014  and 2013  our volumes increased 13  and 14  on a local currency basis versus the comparable periods in the prior years respectively 

operating expenses in 2014  increased 524 million  or 14  from 2013  and increased 389 million  or 11  in 2013  from 2012  primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses as a result of investments to support strategic initiatives acquisitions contributed 6  percentage points to operating expense growth in 2014  

we generated net cash flows from operations of 34 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 41 billion  and 29 billion  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

the following table provides a summary of our operating results for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012    



 not meaningful 

business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies net revenue generated in the united states was 39  of total revenue in each of 2014  2013  and 2012  no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenue in any such period but differences in market growth economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business adverse economic trends including distress in financial markets turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate certain of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in addition further political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue may be negatively impacted or the company may be impacted in several ways mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry notwithstanding recent encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business for a full discussion see “risk factors  business risk” in part i item 1a of this report 

in addition our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry for further discussion see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report further information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future see our risk factor in “risk factors  business risks” in part i item 1a of this report related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal 

european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar for 2014  as compared to 2013  and for 2013  compared to 2012  the us dollar strengthened against the brazilian real but weakened against the euro the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real negatively impacted net income in 2014  by less than 1 percentage point as compared to 2013  conversely net income in 2013  was positively impacted by approximately 1 percentage point as compared to 2012  

in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume “gdv” and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus primarily noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2014  gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 9  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 13  in 2013  gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 13  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 14  the company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the us dollar

gross revenue in 2014  and 2013  increased 15 billion  and 13 billion  or 13  versus 2013  and 2012  respectively driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands transactions other paymentrelated products and services and the impact of acquisitions rebates and incentives in 2014  and 2013  increased 329 million  and 325 million  or 11  and 12  versus 2013  and 2012  respectively due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes our net revenue in 2014  and 2013  increased 14  and 13  versus 2013  and 2012  respectively acquisitions contributed 2  percentage points to net revenue growth in 2014  in 2014  and 2013  our gdv increased 13  and 14  on a local currency basis while our processed transactions increased 12  and 13  respectively 

the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2014  the net revenue from these customers was approximately 22 billion  or 24  of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see our risk factor in “risk factor  business risks” in part i item 1a of this report for further discussion 

the significant components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing depreciation and amortization expenses and the respective amounts recorded for the mdl provision operating expenses increased in 2014  by 524 million  or 14  primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses acquisitions contributed 6  percentage points to operating expense growth in 2014  operating expenses increased in 2013  by 389 million  or 11  compared to 2012  primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses and the 95 million  portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2013  excluding the impact of the mdl provision operating expenses increased 17  in 2014  compared to 2013  and increased 9  in 2013  compared to 2012  

the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses excluding the mdl provision which is a nongaap financial measure to the operating expenses including the mdl provision which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement management believes this analysis facilitates understanding of our ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods 



general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 535 million  or 20  compared to 2013  primarily due to an increase in personnel costs acquisitions contributed 7  percentage points to general and administrative expense growth in 2014  general and administrative expenses increased 220 million  or 9  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in personnel costs 

the significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 



 not meaningful 

 advertising and marketing 

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness preference and usage through integrated advertising sponsorship promotions interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences in 2014  advertising and marketing expenses increased 21 million  or 3  mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships and increased support of our strategic initiatives advertising and marketing expenses increased 66 million  or 8  in 2013  mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships and increased media spend to support our strategic initiatives 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 63 million  or 24  in 2014  and 28 million  or 12  in 2013  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014  was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs and acquisitionrelated intangible assets the increase in 2013  was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs 

provision for litigation settlement 

as of december 31 2014  the accrued litigation related to the mdl provision was 771 million  versus 886 million  as of december 31 2013  the accrued litigation item includes 68 million  as of december 31 2013  related to the timing of mastercard’s administration of the shortterm reduction in default credit interchange from us issuers which expired in april 2014 during 2014 mastercard executed settlement agreements with a number of optout merchants and no adjustments to the amount reserved was deemed necessary in the fourth quarter of 2013 mastercard recorded an incremental net pretax charge of 95 million related to the optout merchants see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses total other expense increased 24 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in march 2014 total other expense decreased 1 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily related to an adjustment in interest expense due to the reversal of tax reserves partially offset by increased expenses from investments in joint ventures 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  were 288  308  and 299  respectively the effective tax rate for 2014  was lower than the effective tax rate for 2013  primarily due to the recognition of a larger repatriation benefit and an increase in the company’s domestic production activity deduction in the us related to the company’s authorization revenue partially offset by an unfavorable mix of taxable earnings in 2014 the effective tax rate for 2013  was higher than the effective tax rate for 2012  primarily due to the recognition of a discrete benefit relating to additional export incentives in 2012 and a lower benefit related to foreign repatriations in 2013 partially offset by a more favorable mix of earnings in 2013 

during the fourth quarter of 2014  we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the us this initiative resulted in a onetime taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom we believe this improved alignment will result in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate see note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35  to pretax income for the years ended december 31 as a result of the following 



the company’s gaap effective tax rates for 2013  was affected by the tax benefits related to the mdl provision as illustrated in the table below the effective tax rate was 299  in 2012  including and excluding the portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2012  



during 2014  the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by 44 million  the increase in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for 2014  was primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions as of december 31 2014  the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were 364 million  all of which would reduce the company’s effective tax rate if recognized 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of the company’s operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region the company’s subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance see note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations credit and settlement exposure capital expenditures investments in our business and current and potential obligations the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations the following table summarizes the cash cash equivalents time deposits and investment securities balances and credit available to the company at december 31 



1  includes 70 million of time deposits included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at december 312014 excludes restricted cash related to the us merchant class litigation settlement of 540 million  and 723 million  at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively 

2  the company did not use any funds from the line of credit during the periods presented except for business continuity planning and related purposes 

cash cash equivalents time deposits and availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to us tax upon repatriation was 26 billion  and 36 billion  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively or 42  and 57  of our total cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities as of such dates the decrease in cash cash equivalents time deposits and availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries during 2014 was primarily driven by prepaid tax in belgium as well as a repatriation of foreign earnings in conjunction with a reorganization undertaken to better align our tax and legal entity structure with our business footprint outside of the us the reorganization occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2014  outside of the united states as disclosed in note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings if these earnings are needed for us operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states the company would be subject to us tax upon repatriation 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard cirrus and maestrobranded transactions between our issuers and acquirers see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a description of these guarantees historically payments under these guarantees have not been significant however historical trends may not be an indication of the future the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers but may also be driven 

significantly by regional or global economic conditions including but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region 

our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a and note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and part ii item 7 business environment of this report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was 34 billion  primarily due to net income the decrease in the cash flow provided by operating activities is primarily due to prepaid income taxes associated with our legal entity and tax reorganization net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was 41 billion  primarily due to net income 

net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily related to the proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities partially offset by purchases of investment securities and acquisitions net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily related to purchases of investment securities and increased property plant and equipment and capitalized software partially offset by net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily related to the repurchase of the company’s class a common stock and dividend payments to our stockholders partially offset by proceeds from the debt offering completed in march 2014 net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily related to the repurchase of the company’s class a common stock and dividend payments to our stockholders 

the table below shows a summary of the balance sheet data at december 31

on august 2 2012 the company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital if needed pursuant to the shelf registration statement the company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities preferred stock class a common stock depository shares purchase contracts units or warrants in one or more offerings 

dividends and share repurchases 

mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock subject to legally available funds we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs the following table summarizes the annual per share dividends paid in the years reflected 



on december 2 2014 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 016  per share paid on february 9 2015 to holders of record on january 9 2015 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend was 184 million  

on february 3 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 016  per share payable on may 8 2015 to holders of record on april 9 2015 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be 184 million 

shares in the company’s common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the operating needs of the business legal requirements price and economic and market conditions in december 2014 the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 375 billion  of its class a common stock as of january 23 2015  the repurchases by the company under the december 2013 share repurchase program in 2015  totaled approximately 25 million  shares of class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately 215 million  at an average price of 8445  per share of class a common stock as of january 23 2015  the company had approximately 38 billion  remaining under the december 2013 share repurchase program and the december 2014 share repurchase program

see note 13 stockholders’ equity to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

mastercard has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2014  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



1  the table does not include the 771 million  provision as of december 31 2014  related to the merchant opt outs and the us merchant class litigation since the opt outs are not fixed and determinable and the company has made a payment into escrow to fund the us merchant class litigation see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

2  amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance mastercard has accrued 17 billion as of december 31 2014  related to customer and merchant agreements 

3  amounts relate to committed severance minimum funding requirements for defined benefit plans and unfunded postemployment benefits us employees hired before july 1 2007 participate in a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan the “qualified plan” with a cash balance feature in 2014 the company began to evaluate whether to terminate the qualified plan we continue to account for the qualified plan on an ongoing basis in our financial statements if we terminate the plan we would be obligated to pay the underfunded status of the plan and take a settlement charge for the portion of the liability that has not been recognized in our statement of operations 

4  the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 364 million  at december 31 2014  and estimates that approximately 1 million  of this liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2014  2013  or 2012  accounted for more than 30 of net revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the application of us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the company’s reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company’s financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company’s board of directors the company’s significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity eg 10 percent are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers’ performance in order to recognize this revenue rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates we consider various factors in estimating customer performance including a review of specific transactions historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions differences between actual results and the company’s estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance if our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance net revenue may be materially different 

loss contingencies 

the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings for further discussion 

income taxes 

in calculating our effective tax rate we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions through our interpretation of local tax regulations adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 

we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and 

if so how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements if upon examination we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situations the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 

we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations we consider business plans planning opportunities and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 

valuation of assets 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level the impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a twostep impairment test the first step is to compare the reporting unit’s carrying value including goodwill to the fair value the company uses a market approach for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value then no potential impairment is considered to exist if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets in performing the qualitative assessment we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events and legal and regulatory factors if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts the company must perform a quantitative impairment test 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately 74 million  on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2014  related to the hedging program a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company’s financial assets or liabilities at december 31 2014  and 2013  in addition there was no material equity price risk at december 31 2014  or 2013  

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward contracts to manage risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currency we also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of earnings assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity the objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months 

as of december 31 2014  all forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency had been entered into with customers of mastercard mastercard’s derivative contracts are summarized below   



our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the company’s available for sale investments for debt securities as of december 31 was as follows 





at december 31 2014  we have a credit facility which provides liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company’s customers this credit facility has variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement see note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on the company’s current and prior credit facilities we had no borrowings under the current or prior credit facilities at december 31 2014  and 2013

our operations and transaction processing network   

introduction   we operate the mastercard network our unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions permitting mastercard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide our network facilitates an efficient and secure means for merchants to receive payments and a convenient quick and secure payment method for consumers and businesses that is accepted worldwide we process transactions through our network for our issuer customers in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories 

typical transaction  with a typical transaction involving four participants in addition to us our network supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payments network the following diagram depicts a typical pointofinteraction transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder or an account holder who may not be using a physical card purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device after the transaction is authorized by the issuer the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and then posts the transaction to the cardholders account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” rate as further described below to the merchant the merchant discount rate among other things takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee 

interchange fees   interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payments system costs among the issuers and acquirers participating in our fourparty payments system they reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants pay we do not earn revenues from interchange fees generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers to acquirers we or financial institutions establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process interchange fees can be a significant component of the merchant discount rate and therefore of the costs that merchants pay to accept electronic payments these fees are currently subject to regulatory legislative andor legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

merchant discount rate   the merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the fourparty system and providing services rendered to merchants the rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer 

additional fees and economic considerations   among the parties in a fourparty system various types of fees may be charged to different constituents for various services acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers fees for the transaction processing and related services we provide 

in a fourparty payments system the economics of a payment transaction relative to mastercard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over our network or a thirdparty network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

mastercard network architecture  the mastercard network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuer customers enabling them to expand into regional and global markets it features an intelligent architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structuresdistributed peertopeer and centralized hubandspoke 

 our network’s architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of whether the transaction is occurring at a traditional physical location at an atm on the internet or through a connected device it has 24hour a day availability and worldclass response time the network incorporates multiple layers of protection both for continuity purposes and to address cybersecurity challenges we engage in multiple efforts to mitigate against such challenges including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities 

participation standards  we establish apply and enforce standards surrounding participation in the mastercard payments system we grant licenses that provide issuers and acquirers that meet specified criteria with certain rights including access to the network and usage of cards and payment devices carrying our brands as a condition of our licenses issuers and acquirers agree to comply with our standards surrounding participation and brand usage and acceptance we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent illegal and branddamaging activity issuers and acquirers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so that we can monitor trends and initiate action when appropriate 

customer risk management  we guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our issuers and acquirers to ensure the integrity of our network “settlement exposure” we do not however guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirer or the availability of unspent prepaid cardholder account balances as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of mastercard maestro and cirrus and affiliate debit licensees principal customers participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure of a customer to meet its settlement obligations we monitor the financial health of economic and political operating environments of and compliance with our standards by our customers we employ various strategies to mitigate against these risks

 item 1a   risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks   

interchange fees and acceptance practices receive significant and intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations   

interchange fees are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards they are also a factor on which we compete with other payment providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process over our network we do not earn revenues from interchange fees    we have historically set default interchange fees in the united states and certain other countries in some jurisdictions interchange fees and related practices are subject to legislation regulation and litigation as electronic forms of payment have become more important to local economies regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries as well as merchants are seeking to reduce these fees through legislation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation andor litigation 

examples of legislative activity related to interchange fees include 

 14 

following elements 1 a cap on credit and debit interchange fees of 30 and 20 basis points per transaction respectively initially for intraeea crossborder consumer transactions these crossborder rates are comparable to the consumer rates mastercard has applied for europe on a weighted average basis since july 2009 and subsequently for all domestic consumer transactions in the eea 2 restrictions on our “honor all cards” rule with respect to products with different levels of interchange 3 a prohibition of surcharging by merchants for products that are subject to regulated interchange rates 4 the prohibition of rules that prevent an issuer from “cobadging” that is putting a competing brand on its credit or debit cards and 5 the separation of brand and processing in terms of legal form organization and decision making procedurally the proposed legislation is currently being debated and may be potentially amended by the european union parliament the proposed legislation will also need to be reviewed by the council of ministers and the european commission before it can be adopted any final legislation if approved by the european union parliament and the council of ministers could be different than what is in the initial proposal 

 examples of competitionrelated regulatory proceedings or inquiries around the world with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices include 

 examples of regulation or potential regulation by central banks and similar types of regulatory authorities around the world with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices include 

 see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a detailed description of regulatory proceedings and inquiries into interchange fees we believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in this part i item 1a related to the impact of new regulations or other legislative or regulatory activity in one jurisdiction or of one product to other jurisdictions or other products 

additionally merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees and impact acceptance rules through litigation such litigation includes 

 15 

 see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees issuers will be unable to use interchange fees to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payments system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services thereby making our card programs less desirable to consumers and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability in addition issuers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card and other payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them this could also result in less innovation and fewer product offerings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have a more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to its competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees any such legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

the doddfrank act may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations   

the doddfrank act enacted in the united states includes provisions that provide for the regulation by the federal reserve of debit and prepaid interchange fees and certain other network industry practices among other things it requires debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” referred to in the doddfrank act as fees established charged or received by a payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in an electronic debit transaction to be “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction” additionally it provides that neither an issuer nor a payment card network may establish exclusive network arrangements for debit or prepaid cards or inhibit the ability of a merchant to choose among different networks for routing debit or prepaid transactions 

the federal reserve regulations implementing these provisions limit pertransaction us debit and prepaid interchange fees to 21 cents plus five basis points the issuer may receive a fraud prevention adjustment of an additional one cent if it meets certain requirements the regulations contain exemptions from the interchange limitations for issuers that together with their affiliates have less than 10 billion in assets as well as for debit cards issued pursuant to a governmentadministered payment program and certain reloadable prepaid cards also while the regulations do not directly regulate network fees they make clear that network fees cannot be used to circumvent the interchange fee restrictions see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in this part i item 1a with respect to interchange fees and related practices receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide issuers and networks are required to file various types of information regarding debit and prepaid transactions with the federal reserve periodically and such information could be used by the federal reserve to reexamine and potentially reset the interchange cap with respect to network arrangements and transaction routing the regulations require debit and prepaid cards to be enabled with two unaffiliated payments networks the regulations also provide that an issuer or payments network may not inhibit the ability of any person that accepts or honors a debit or prepaid card to direct the routing of the card transaction for processing over any network enabled on the card 

in july 2013 the us district court for the district of columbia the “district court” granted summary judgment in favor of a group of retailers and retailer trade associations overturning these federal reserve regulations with regard to interchange fees and network nonexclusivity the district court’s decision requires the federal reserve to revise its regulations to consider only incremental authorization clearing and settlement costs in determining the level of interchange fees as well as require two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions for each authentication method pin and signature the federal reserve has appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the “appellate court” and the district court has issued an order staying its decision pending this appeal as a result the federal reserve’s debit interchange regulations remain in effect until the appellate process is completed the appellate court has granted a motion to expedite the federal reserve’s appeal and a decision is expected in 2014 if the district court’s ruling is upheld the federal reserve would be required to revise its regulations in accordance with the ruling it is not clear at what level the federal reserve would set the interchange fees although based on the decision the level of interchange fees likely would be significantly reduced 

the cfpb and fsoc were both created under the doddfrank act the cfpb has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products although it is not clear whether andor to what extent it will regulate broader aspects of payment card networks the fsoc is tasked with identifying payment clearing and settlement systems that are “systemically important” if mastercard were designated “systemically important” it would be subject to new risk management regulations relating to its payment clearing and settlement activities new regulations could address areas such as risk management policies and procedures collateral requirements participant default policies and procedures the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transactions and capital and financial resource requirements also a “systemically important” payments system could be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve or another federal agency for changes to its system rules procedures or operations that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payments system these developments or actions could increase the cost of operating our business and may make electronic payment transactions less attractive to card issuers as well as consumers this could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues 

if issuers acquirers andor merchants modify their business operations or otherwise take actions in response to this legislation the federal reserve’s regulations andor any revised rules that have the result of reducing the number of debit or prepaid transactions we process or the network fees we collect the doddfrank act could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in order to successfully compete in such an environment we and our customers would each need to adjust our strategies accordingly 

we entered into an agreement to settle the current us merchant class litigation that among other things requires us to not restrict us merchants subject to certain conditions from surcharging credit card transactions which could impact the use of electronic payments and result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and could in turn materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have historically implemented policies referred to as nosurcharge rules in certain regions including the united states that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means as part of the terms of the settlement of the us merchant class litigation entered into by the company in october 2012 which has received final court approval the company and visa have modified their nosurcharge or comparable rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations including ensuring that mastercard or visa cardholders are not unfairly subject to surcharging relative to cardholders of competing credit card networks such as american express discover and paypal should those networks enforce rules that restrict surcharging it is possible that over time us merchants in some or all merchant categories may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change which could make credit card programs less desirable to consumers in the united states in the event that such merchants surcharge credit cards this could result in consumers having a less favorable view of our products andor using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

new regulations or other regulatory activity with respect to the payments industry in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations or impact pending regulatory proceedings in other jurisdictions or of other products 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each others approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions for example the december 2007 european commission decision with respect to crossborder interchange fees could also lead to additional competition authorities in european member states commencing investigations or proceedings regarding domestic interchange fees or initiating regulation the general court’s judgment in may 2012 upholding the european commission’s decision has increased the possibility of such actions as well as the possibility of an adverse outcome for us in related and pending matters similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations affecting debit transactions such as the federal reserves rules implementing the doddfrank act could lead to regulation of other consumer products including credit see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in this part i item 1a with respect to government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payment services in certain countries 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated in other jurisdictions or involving other products affecting our business these include matters like interchange rates network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business with the same effect either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

government actions preferring or protecting providers of domestic payment services in certain countries may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries such as china russia ukraine and india could act or have acted to provide resources or preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and processing providers or may otherwise create or have created and support its own national provider this action may displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies as an example governments in some countries are considering or may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies such a development would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for customers our efforts to effect change in or work with these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards and other devices are used in particular many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently we are at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “businessgovernment regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation examples include 

 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to 

comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards and devices issued and could increase our costs 

we are subject to regulations related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business these regulations could result in negative impacts to our business due to recent account data compromise events at large usbased retailers as well as the disclosure of the monitoring activities by certain governmental agencies there has been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may require changes to our data practices in regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information failure to comply with the these laws and regulations could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation any additional or changes to regulations in these areas as well as the manner in which such laws could be interpreted or applied may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring and the development of information based products and solutions in addition these regulations may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment products which may in turn decrease the number of our cards and other payment devices that they issue any of these changes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations   

we are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations including among others those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings in the event we are found liable in any of these material litigations or proceedings particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damages which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation and litigation settlements such as changes to our nosurcharge rule in the united states any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

potential changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

potential changes in existing tax laws such as recent proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states including the treatment of earnings of controlled foreign corporations may impact our effective tax rate and tax payments this could adversely impact our results of operations see also note 17 income tax to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

business risks   

substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased or other electronic payment programs or systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use programs contactless mobile and webbased payment platforms and other electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments within the global general purpose payments industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa american express discover unionpay jcb and paypal among others in certain jurisdictions including the united states visa has greater volume scale and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantages moreover some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have 

our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcomes of litigation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank activity and legislative activity 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate endtoend payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of endtoend payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours in which we must typically rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition even when they operate programs that utilize a fourparty system these competitors have generally not attracted the same level of regulatory or legislative scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a fourparty system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not we could lose business to these competitors see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth our customers can also develop their own competitive services we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems ecommerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices as well as physical store locations a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

potential future changes in the competitive landscape including disintermediation from other participants in the payments value chain also could harm our business   

we expect that there may be future changes in the competitive landscape including 

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we face continued intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations   

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our products in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations in addition 

increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

continuing consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for us and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers resulting in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations    

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor if significant consolidation were to continue in the banking industry it may result in the substantial loss of business for us which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business 

consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which we have a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

if we lose a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term which could have a material adverse longterm impact on our business     

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

merchants continue to be focused on the costs of accepting electronic forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

merchants are an important constituency in our payments system we rely on both our relationships with them as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers to expand the acceptance of our cards and payment devices we also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels create better purchase experiences improve efficiencies increase revenues and fight fraud in the retail industry there is a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard has been defending including the us merchant litigations as to which the company recently entered into a settlement agreement which has received final court approval see our risk factor in this part i item 1a with respect to interchange fees and related practices receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide also see our risk factor in “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks” in this part i item 1a with respect to the doddfrank act the continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards and devices as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase 

the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives 

certain customers have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and may have a material adverse impact on our business   

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers to manage our payments system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our issuers and acquirers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our products for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected   

while we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system including merchants and governments we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards or other payment devices extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders using our products each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in “risk factors  business risks” in this part i item 1a with respect to how we guarantee certain third party obligations for further discussion 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payments system among consumers in these countries we also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries alongside our own relationships with them from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards and other payment devices carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our products and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

the marketplaces perception of our brands and reputation may materially and adversely affect our overall business   

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to our branded products depends highly upon the external perception of us and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances our use of social media or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes 

could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business 

our work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 

as we increase our work with national state and local governments both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 global economic events in financial markets have directly affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations   

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business adverse economic events including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention have impacted the financial markets around the world the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world have been significantly impacted by this economic turmoil countries have experienced credit ratings actions by rating agencies including several in europe as well as the united states in addition some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercards financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following 

 23 

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our results of operations as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions   

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and transaction processing fees revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with crossborder travel and our customers need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases any such decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our results of operations 

general economic and global political conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our results of operations   

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending as well as the impact of events in the united states such as deadlines on the debt limit in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our payment cards and devices also as we are principally based in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business 

as a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of principal customers and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity     

we may incur obligations in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons if a principal customer or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss in addition although we are not obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations or to keep prepaid cardholders whole if an issuer defaults on its obligation to safeguard unspent prepaid funds our mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded gross legal settlement exposure which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 41 billion  as of december 31 2013 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 3 billion  which could be used for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in the event that mastercard effects a payment on behalf of a failed customer mastercard may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables from the failed customer subject to approval by our board of directors customers may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during these ordinary course activities of mastercard while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited as a result concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our overall business in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations moreover during 2013 many of our financial institution customers continued to be directly and adversely impacted by adverse economic events in the global financial markets these conditions present increased risk that we may have to perform 

under our settlement guarantees for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices as of december 31 2013 see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

separately mastercard also provides guarantees to certain customers and other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from our failure to perform with respect to our products and services or the failure of third parties to perform any significant indemnification obligation which we owe to any such customers or other companies could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain as well as our cardholders rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control we routinely are subject to cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to cyberattacks because of our position in the payments value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks 

to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however if one or more of these events occurs it could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services which could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises such events could also cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as the lack of availability of our valueadded systems as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties any actual attacks could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs to mastercard such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

we maintain an information security program a business continuity program and insurance coverage and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks we also test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats the prominent size and scale of mastercard and our role in the global payments and technology industries our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and cardholders when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of third party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities as a result cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

if our transaction processing systems and other services are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions or service our customers efficiently or at all our results of operations would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems and other key service offerings may experience interruptions as a result of a disaster including but not limited to technology malfunctions fire weather events power outages telecommunications disruptions terrorism workplace violence accidents or other catastrophic events our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists activists or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities andor systems a disaster that occurs 

at or in the vicinity of our primary andor backup facilities in any global location could interrupt our services although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks 

additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially reduce our results of operations 

account data breaches involving card data stored processed or transmitted by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

we our issuers and acquirers merchants and other third parties process transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards and devices in addition our customers may sponsor or we may certify as pcicompliant thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage our reputation and lead to claims against us as well as subject us to regulatory actions we routinely encounter account data compromise events some of which have been high profile involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affect millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of cardholders these events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants’ or thirdparty processors’ systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems further data security breaches may subject us to reputational damage andor lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands while most of these lawsuits do not involve direct claims against us we could face damage claims in various circumstances which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our results of operations damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices as well as the trend toward electronic payments which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes results of operations and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands andor regulatory intervention which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards in addition fraud is more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as ecommerce and mobile commerce transactions which are becoming increasingly prominent increased fraud levels involving our cards or misconduct or negligence by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

rapid technological developments in our industry present both operational and legal challenges including potential intellectual property exposure which could impact our results of operations or limit our future growth   

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless payment devices electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards and by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes by the complexity of our systems our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from patent holders for example other operating companies or nonpracticing entities suggesting that we may be infringing certain patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    

failure to keep pace with these technological developments could lead to a decline in the use of our products which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations 

during 2013 approximately 61  of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies 

in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar if the us dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars 

the occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation   

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies in addition the integration of any acquisition or investment including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity may divert managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions

our organizational documents and delaware law contain terms and provisions that could be considered antitakeover provisions or could have an impact on a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further except in limited circumstances no customer or former customer of mastercard or any operator customer or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

as of february 6 2014  the foundation owned 119214210  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 104  of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to april 26 2026 twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements for which purpose earlier sales are permitted the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a companys performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” pursuant to the requirements of regulation sk portions of this “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include a reconciliation of certain nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap

 overview 

we recorded net income of 31 billion  or 256  per diluted share in 2013  versus net income of 28 billion  or 219  per diluted share in 2012  and net income of 19 billion  or 148  per diluted share in 2011  our 2011 net income was significantly impacted by the 770 million  portion of the mdl provision  495 million  after tax recorded in 2011 in 2013 and 2012 the company increased the provision by 95 million   61 million  after tax and 20 million  13 million after tax respectively 

our net revenue increased 13  and 10  in 2013  and 2012  primarily driven by increased growth in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and the number of transactions processed by the company in 2013  and 2012  both volumebased revenue domestic assessments and crossborder volume fees and transactionbased revenue transaction processing fees   increased compared to 2012  by 12  and 13  respectively in 2013  and 2012  our processed transactions increased 13  and 25  versus the comparable periods in 2012  and 2011  respectively in 2013  and 2012  our volumes increased 14  and 15  on a local currency basis versus the comparable periods in 2012  and 2011  respectively rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue were 26  in both 2013  and 2012  and 24  in 2011  

operating expenses in 2013  increased 389 million  or 11  from 2012  and decreased 547 million  or 14  in 2012  from 2011  primarily due to the 2011 portion of the mdl provision we generated net cash flows from operations of 41 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 29 billion  and 27 billion  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively

business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies net revenue generated in the united states was 39  of total revenue in both 2013  and 2012  and 40  in 2011  no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenue in any such period but differences in market growth economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business adverse economic events including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention have impacted the financial markets around the world the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world have been significantly impacted by this economic turmoil countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies including several in europe as well as the united states in addition some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in addition further political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue may be negatively impacted or the company may be impacted in several ways mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry notwithstanding recent encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business for a full discussion see risk factors  business risk in part i item 1a of this report 

in addition our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry for further discussion see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a of this report  further information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future see our risk factor in risk factors  business risks in part i item 1a of this report related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar for 2013  as compared to 2012  the us dollar strengthened against the brazilian real but weakened against the euro for 2012  compared to 2011  the us dollar strengthened against both the euro and the brazilian real the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real increased net income in 2013  compared to 2012  by 1  percentage point conversely net income in 2012  was negatively impacted by currency by approximately 7  percentage points when compared to 2011  

in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume gdv and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus primarily noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2013  gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 12  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 14  in 2012  gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 12  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 15  the company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the us dollar 

financial results 

revenue 

revenue description 

mastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders merchants issuers the cardholders’ financial institutions and acquirers the merchants’ financial institutions our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated products and services our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro and brazilian real 

the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers our revenue can be significantly impacted by the following 

 the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories 

 34 

 revenue analysis 

gross revenue in 2013  and 2012  increased 13  billion and 11  billion or 13  versus 2012  and 2011  respectively primarily driven by increased growth in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions rebates and incentives in 2013  and 2012  increased 326  million and 472  million or 12  and 22  versus 2012  and 2011  respectively due to the impact from new renewed and expired agreements our net revenue in 2013  and 2012  increased 13  and 10  versus 2012  and 2011  respectively 

our revenue is primarily based on volumes and transactions which are driven by the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands and the number of transactions in 2013  and 2012  our gdv increased 14  and 15  on a local currency basis and our processed transactions increased 13  and 25  respectively 

the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth 



1  excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2013  the net revenue from these customers was approximately 21 billion  or 25  of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see our risk factor in risk factor  business risks in part i item 1a of this report for further discussion 

the significant components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  were as follows

4 positively impacted by acquisitions consulting fees fraud service fees and other paymentrelated products and services 

5  rebates and incentives other includes the impact from new renewed and expired agreements 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing depreciation and amortization expenses and the respective amounts recorded for the mdl provision operating expenses increased in 2013  by 389 million  or 11  primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses and the 95 million   portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2013  operating expenses decreased in 2012  by 547 million  or 14  compared to 2011  primarily due to the 770 million  portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2011  versus the 20 million  portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2012  excluding the impact of the mdl provision operating expenses increased 314 million  or 9  in 2013  compared to 2012  and increased 203 million  or 6  in 2012  compared to 2011  

the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses excluding the mdl provision which is a nongaap financial measure to the operating expenses including the mdl provision which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement management believes this analysis facilitates understanding of our ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods 



general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in personnel costs general and administrative expenses increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to increased personnel costs the net impact of currency hedging activities and the remeasurement of financial assets denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity holding those assets the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of general and administrative expenses from our functional currencies to us dollars increased general and administrative expenses by less than 1 percentage point in 2013  and reduced general and administrative expenses by approximately 2  percentage points in 2012  

the major components of general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  were as follows 



 not meaningful 

 37 

increased meeting and travel expenses to support business and strategy development efforts the 2012  increase in other expenses versus 2011  was primarily due to increased costs associated with loyalty and rewards programs and the acquisition of access prepaid worldwide access in 2011 

advertising and marketing 

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness preference and usage through integrated advertising sponsorship promotions interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences in 2013  advertising and marketing expenses increased 66 million  or 8  mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships and increased media spend to support our strategic initiatives advertising and marketing expenses decreased 66 million  or 8  in 2012  mainly due to the nonrecurrence of certain promotions and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of advertising and marketing expenses from our functional currencies to us dollars increased advertising and marketing expenses by less than 1 percentage point in 2013  and decreased advertising and marketing expense by 3  percentage points in 2012  

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 28 million  or 12  in 2013  and 36 million  or 18  in 2012  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in both 2013  and 2012  was primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software costs 

provision for litigation settlement 

as of december 31 2013  the accrued litigation related to the mdl provision was 886 million  versus 726 million  as of december 31 2012  in the fourth quarter of 2013  mastercard recorded an incremental net pretax charge of 95 million  related to the opt out merchants the accrual also includes 68 million  related to the timing of mastercards administration of the shortterm reduction in default credit interchange from us issuers there is a corresponding equal amount presented in settlement due from customers during 2012 accrued litigation related to the mdl provision decreased due to the payment of 64 million  to individual merchant plaintiffs partially offset by an increase of 20 million  in the mdl provision see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses total other expense decreased 1 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily related to an adjustment in interest expense due to the reversal of tax reserves partially offset by increased expenses from investments in joint ventures the decrease in other income in 2012  of 39 million  compared to 2011  was primarily due to lower investment income increased expenses from investments in joint ventures and an adjustment to the earnout related to the companys acquisition of access in 2011  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  were 308  299  and 306  respectively the effective tax rate for 2013  was higher than the effective tax rate for 2012  primarily due to the recognition of a discrete benefit relating to additional export incentives in 2012 and a lower benefit related to foreign repatriations in 2013 partially offset by a more favorable mix of earnings in 2013 the effective tax rate for 2012  was lower than the effective tax rate for 2011  primarily due to discrete benefits related to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions as well as a larger benefit from the domestic production activities deduction in the us related to our authorization software 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35  to pretax income for the years ended december 31  as a result of the following 



the companys gaap effective tax rates for 2013  and 2011  were affected by the tax benefits related to the mdl provision as illustrated in the table below the effective tax rate was 299  in 2012  including and excluding the portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2012  



during 2013  the companys unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by 63 million  the increase in the companys unrecognized tax benefits for 2013  was primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions as of december 31 2013  the companys unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were 320 million  all of which would reduce the companys effective tax rate if recognized 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of the companys operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region the companys subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance see note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion

2  the company did not use any funds from the line of credit during the periods presented except for business continuity planning and related purposes 

the increase in net cash provided by operations is primarily due to increases in net income in 2013 and 2012  cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to us tax upon repatriation was 36 billion  and 25 billion  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively or 57  and 50  of our total cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities as of such dates it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2013  outside of the united states as disclosed in note 17 income tax to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings if these earnings are needed for us operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states the company would be subject to us tax upon repatriation 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions the company guarantees the settlement of many of the mastercard cirrus and maestro branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a description of these guarantees historically payments under these guarantees have not been significant however historical trends may not be an indication of the future the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions including but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region 

our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a and note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and part ii item 7 business environment of this report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business

shares in the companys common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the operating needs of the business legal requirements price and economic and market conditions on december 10 2013 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 35 billion  of its class a common stock during january 2014 the company exhausted its purchases under the february 2013 share repurchase program and began purchasing shares under the december 2013 share repurchase program as of january 24 2014  the cumulative repurchases by the company under both the february 2013 share repurchase program and december 2013 share repurchase program in 2014 totaled approximately 42 million  shares of class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately 351 million  at an average price of 8300  per share of class a common stock as of january 24 2014 the company had approximately 33 billion  remaining under the december 2013 share repurchase program

offbalance sheet arrangements 

mastercard has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2013  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



1  the capital lease for the global technology and operations center located in o’fallon missouri has been excluded from this table since the company holds refunding revenue bonds equal to the payments due on the lease see note 7 property plant and equipment included in part ii item 8 of this report for further information 

2  the table does not include the 886 million  provision as of december 31 2013  related to the merchant opt outs and the us merchant class litigation since the opt outs are not fixed and determinable and the company has made a payment into escrow to fund the us merchant class litigation or has a corresponding equal amount presented in settlement due from customers see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

3  amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance mastercard has accrued 15 billion as of december 31 2013 related to customer and merchant agreements 

4  amounts relate to committed unfunded postemployment benefits and minimum funding requirements for defined benefit plans 

5  the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 320 million  at december 31 2013  and estimates that approximately 1 million  of this liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2013  2012  or 2011  accounted for more than 30 of net revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the application of us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the companys reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the companys financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors the companys significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity eg 10 percent are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent managements predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates specifically complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may 

require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers performance in order to recognize domestic assessments revenue rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates we consider various factors in estimating customer performance including a review of specific transactions historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions differences between actual results and the companys estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance net revenue may be materially different 

loss contingencies 

the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

income taxes 

in calculating our effective tax rate we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions through our interpretation of local tax regulations adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 

we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and if so how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements if upon examination we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situations the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 

we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations we consider business plans planning opportunities and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 

valuation of assets 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company early adopted new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance that simplifies how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allowing a qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative 

assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and the companys market capitalization if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts the company must perform a quantitative impairment test 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately 189 million  on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2013  related to the hedging program a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the companys financial assets or liabilities at december 31 2013  and 2012  in addition there was no material equity price risk at december 31 2013  or 2012  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states includes provisions related to derivative financial instruments the company believes the adoption of such provisions will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position or results of operations 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward contracts to manage risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currency we also enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of earnings assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity the objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional and reporting currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months 

as of december 31 2013  all forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency had been entered into with customers of mastercard mastercard’s derivative contracts are summarized below   



our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the companys available for sale investments as of december 31 was as follows 





1 shortterm bond funds of 210 million had no contractual maturity 

at december 31 2013  we have a credit facility which provides liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the companys customers this credit facility has variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement see note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on the companys current and prior credit facilities we had no borrowings under the current or prior credit facilities at december 31 2013  or 2012

overview   

mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers financial institutions merchants governments and businesses worldwide enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks we make payments more convenient secure and efficient by creating solutions that meet the needs of all of our stakeholders and thereby drive preference for electronic payments we offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable the development and implementation of credit debit prepaid commercial and related payment programs and solutions for consumers and merchants our customers encompass a vast array of entities including financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers” merchants governments telecommunications companies and other businesses we manage a family of wellknown widelyaccepted payment brands including mastercard® maestro® and cirrus® which our customers use in their payment programs and solutions we process payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network and provide support services to our customers and others we establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network 

we generate revenue by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity or gross dollar volume “gdv” on the cards and other devices that carry our brands 

a typical transaction processed over our network involves four parties in addition to us the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholders financial institution and the acquirer the merchants financial institution consequently the payments network we operate supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payments system using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers who are our customers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient quick and secure payment method that is accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions between our issuers and acquirers to ensure the integrity of our payments network we offer a number of valueadded services and solutions to our customers merchants and consumers including among others loyalty and rewards solutions fraud prevention and detection services alert and other controls and information services through our mastercard advisors group in addition we carry out marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands while cardholder and merchant transaction relationships are generally managed by our customers we work with merchants to help provide value to them and benefits to consumers we provide merchants with the opportunity to increase revenue build a recurring relationship with consumers accept sales through new channels create a better purchase experience improve efficiencies and address fraud concerns we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the “merchant discount” rate charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

our business has a global reach and has continued to experience growth in 2012  we processed 342 billion  transactions a 25  increase over the number of transactions processed in 2011  gdv on cards carrying the mastercard logo as reported by our customers was 36 trillion  in 2012  a 15  increase in local currency terms and a 12  increase in us dollar terms over the gdv reported in 2011 

our ability to grow is based on three drivers 

 we support our focus on these drivers by continuing to 

 4 

 we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment in recent years we have faced heightened regulatory and legislative scrutiny and other legal challenges particularly with respect to interchange fees interchange fees balance payments system costs among acquirers and issuers and in turn among merchants and cardholders these fees however have been the subject of regulatory review and challenges and legislative action as well as litigation as electronic forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers we do not earn revenues from interchange fees see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

the global payments industry    

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread use of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard visa® american express® jcb® diners club® unionpay® and discover® these brands including mastercard have come to be associated with a variety of forms of payment in the united states and other markets around the world including depending on the brand credit charge debit and prepaid cards regional and domesticlocal debit brands that require a personal identification number “pin” for verification represent alternative and sometimes primary brands within many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and other brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions 

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a portion of all cardbased forms of payment typically private label cards are credit cards issued by or on behalf of a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at that merchants locations 

payment services and solutions 

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services as well as a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design package and implement products and programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers we work with customers to provide customized solutions as well as more general solutions our payment solutions are built upon 

our expertise in payment programs product development payment processing technology loyalty and rewards solutions payment security consulting and information services and marketing    we also manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through advertising promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives 

transaction processing on the mastercard worldwide network   

introduction   we operate the mastercard worldwide network our proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide we process transactions through our network for financial institutions and other entities that are our customers in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories 

typical transaction  a typical transaction processed over the mastercard worldwide network involves four participants in addition to us cardholder merchant issuer the cardholders financial institution and acquirer the merchants financial institution the following diagram depicts a typical pointofinteraction card transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device after the transaction is authorized by the issuer using our network the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and then posts the transaction to the cardholders account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” rate as further described below to the merchant the merchant discount rate among other things takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee 

interchange fees   interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payments system costs among the issuers and acquirers participating in our fourparty payments system they reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants pay we do not earn revenues from interchange fees generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers or netted by issuers against amounts paid to acquirers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers to acquirers we establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process interchange fees can be a significant component of the merchant discount rate and therefore of the costs that merchants pay to accept electronic payments these fees are currently subject to regulatory legislative andor legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

merchant discount rate   the merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of participating in the fourparty system and generally to provide for a profit margin with respect to services rendered to the merchant the rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer 

additional fees and economic considerations   among the parties in a fourparty system various types of fees may be charged to different constituents for various services for example acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers transactionbased and related fees for the transaction processing and related services we provide them 

in a fourparty payments system the economics of a payment transaction relative to mastercard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over our network or a thirdparty network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

authentication  generally transactions processed over our network can be authenticated at the point of interaction and across the processing value chain a typical transaction processed over our network can be authenticated in several ways depending on the type of card or device being used 

 in addition some payment cards and devices are equipped with an rfid radio frequency identification microchip which provides an advanced authentication technique and technology that allows contactless payments requiring neither signature nor pin under established maximum transaction amounts 

mastercard worldwide network architecture and operations  we believe the architecture of the mastercard worldwide network is unique featuring a globally integrated structure that provides scalability for our customers and enables them to expand into regional and global markets our network also features an intelligent architecture that enables it to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structuresdistributed peertopeer and centralized hubandspoke transactions that require fast reliable processing such as those submitted using a contactless card or device at a toll booth can use the networks distributed processing structure ensuring they are processed close to where the transaction occurred transactions that require valueadded processing such as realtime access to transaction data for fraud scoring or rewards at the pointofsale or customization of transaction data for unique consumerspending controls use the networks centralized processing structure ensuring advanced processing services are applied to the transaction through the unique architecture of our network we are able to connect all parties with respect to payments transactions regardless of whether the transaction is occurring at a traditional physical location at an atm on the internet or through a mobile device 

the network typically operates at under 80 capacity and has the capacity to handle more than 160 million transactions per hour with an average network response time of 130 milliseconds the network can also substantially scale capacity to meet demand our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year our global payments network provides multiple levels of backup protection and related continuity procedures should the issuer acquirer or payments network experience a service interruption moreover the network features multiple layers of protection against hacking or other cyberattacks see our risk factor in risk factors  business risks in part i item 1a of this report related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks we supplement this protection with mitigation efforts to strengthen our protection against such threats both in terms of operability of the network and protection of the information transmitted through the network to date we have consistently maintained availability of our global processing systems more than 999 of the time

with a consistent recognizable message that supports our brand around the globe we continue to refine our consumer marketing approach including by placing greater strategic focus on consumers spending preferences for example priceless cities® is a global program intended to increase preference for the mastercard brand by connecting consumers to their interests by offering them access to special experiences and offers when they are at home or traveling mastercard launched priceless cities in 2011 in three cities  new york london and toronto  and in 2012 the program was extended to include more than 20 cities across all of our regions 

we continue to support our brand by using digital mobile and social channels to allow us to engage more directly with our stakeholders and allow consumers and customers to engage directly in programs promotions and merchant offers as well as provide relevant information on mastercard products services and tools mastercard has also introduced both global and regionspecific smart phone applications including mastercards atm hunter® mastercard easy savings® paypass locator mcompass and budget pilot that provide consumers with onthego utility mastercard continues to use digital and mobile channels and social media to develop preference and usage with consumers and more effectively partner with customers and merchants to help them drive their respective businesses for example we have used facebook to run our priceless music programs which offer music benefits and music mobile applications to mastercard cardholders in australia and mexico 

we also seek to deliver value to customers and consumers through the sponsorship of a variety of sporting entertainment and charityrelated marketing properties we have partnerships with major league baseball the pga tour the union of european football association champions league the walt disney company in europe the grammy awards and the brit awards in 2012 we continued and expanded our partnership with stand up to cancer which ties mastercard cardholder use of mastercard cards and other payment devices in restaurants and online to our donations to cancer research we also entered into a sponsorship partnership in 2012 with the brazilian football confederation brazils national football team also in 2012 we entered into a sponsorship partnership with sonoma state university in northern california to sponsor its new performing arts center our approach to sponsorship assets aligns with consumer segments important to us and our customers 

customer and stakeholder relationship management   

we are committed to providing issuers and acquirers merchants governments telecommunications companies and other parties that play a role in the payments industry with coordinated services that leverage our expertise in payment programs product development technology processing consulting and information services and marketing we manage our relationships with our customers and other parties including processors and other third parties on a global and regional basis to ensure that their priorities are consistently identified and incorporated into our product brand processing technology and related strategies and to ensure we provide value to them 

issuers and acquirers  in addition to the many ways described above that we provide value to issuers and acquirers we enter into business agreements which provide customers with financial incentives and other support benefits to issue accept route prioritize and promote our branded products and other payment programs these financial incentives may be based on gdv or other performancebased criteria such as issuance of new payment products increased acceptance of our products launch of new programs or execution of marketing initiatives we believe that our business agreements with these customers have contributed to our volume and revenue growth in recent years 

merchants   merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payments system and we are working to further develop and enhance our relationships with them and provide value to merchants of all sizes our core programs enable merchants to receive secure and timely payments from cardholders across the globe we provide merchants with solutions that help to increase revenues enable new sales channels create better purchase experiences improve efficiencies and address fraud for example we provide merchants the opportunity to increase revenue through the suite of information consulting and managed services offered by mastercard advisors which can help them understand specific activity in their industry evaluate their sales performance against competitors and focus direct marketing efforts we enable merchants to build a recurring relationship with their customers through products and solutions such as reloadable prepaid solutions as well as in some circumstances licensing them directly as issuers through our priceless cities platform we work with merchants to build consumer affection and deepen their existing customer relationships in terms of enabling new sales channels we give merchants a way to accept payments through channels like mobile and help merchants create better purchase experiences through platforms such as our digital platform supporting payments instore online and on tablets and mobile devices we can also help merchants improve efficiencies with solutions such as our contactless technology and our internet payment gateways merchants can address fraud concerns with fraud detection and prevention solutions like our expert monitoring system finally we provide merchant forums and antipiracy programs to inform educate and share information with merchants on topics that are relevant to them such as fraud 

despite these opportunities we also face challenges in our relationships with merchants we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard in particular large merchants have supported 

many of the litigation legislative and regulatory challenges related to interchange fees that mastercard and others in the industry have been defending against this includes the us merchant litigations as to which the company recently entered into a settlement agreement subject to final court approval see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a of this report related to merchants continued focus on the costs of accepting electronic forms of payment 

governments  we work closely with national state and local governments including regulators and agencies around the world to not only help shape payments regulation but to work together strategically with governments to help them provide safe efficient and transparent ways to serve their payment needs and that of their people we provide governments with solutions that help them reduce costs gain efficiencies curtail fraud and corruption and advance social programs we work with governments to reduce costs by providing electronic payment solutions that save the expense of producing managing and disbursing currency in addition we help drive government efficiency by providing ways to eliminate paper systems implement identification solutions manage social payments improve procurement through travel and entertainment procurement cards and purchasing payment automation and deploy improved transit payment options using chip and our contactless technology we also work with governments to provide them with more efficient ways to deliver social benefits including through prepaid cards as well as products and solutions to help reduce errors and curtail fraud our products and programs can help governments drive financial inclusion by providing initial or improved access to financial services for the underbanked we work with governments to provide payment solutions such as reloadable prepaid or debit payroll or other social benefit cards including cards to aid victims of natural disasters and products and solutions that enable mobile commerce payments 

mastercard revenue sources    

we generate revenues by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and assessing our customers based on gdv on the cards and other devices that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted both by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards and other devices carrying our brands our net revenues are classified into the following five categories 

 our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers the following factors impact the pricing 

 in general a crossborder transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since crossborder fees are higher than domestic fees and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis in addition standard pricing varies among our regions and such standard pricing can be modified 

for our customers through customerspecific incentive and rebate agreements revenues from processing crossborder transactions fluctuate with crossborder activities see our risk factor in risk factors  business risks in part i item 1a of this report related to crossborder travel 

in 2012 net revenues from our five largest customers accounted for approximately 18 billion  or 24  of our total revenue no single customer generated greater than 10 of total revenue 

see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  revenues” in part ii item 7 for more detail 

gdv and processed transactions 

the tables below provide information regarding two key drivers of our revenue 1 gdv which forms the basis of volumebased revenues and 2 processed transactions 

gdv  the gdv table below provides information regarding the gdv for all mastercardbranded cards excluding cirrus and maestro and for both mastercard credit and charge programs and mastercard debit and prepaid programs in all of our regions for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  growth rates are provided on both a us dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated gdv represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with mastercardbranded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks 



 note that figures in the above table may not sum due to rounding 

1 gdv generated by maestro and cirrus cards is not included the data for gdv is provided by mastercard customers and includes information with respect to mastercardbranded transactions that are not processed by mastercard and for which mastercard does not earn significant revenues all data is subject to revision and amendment by mastercards customers subsequent to the date of its release which revisions and amendments may be material 

2 local currency growth eliminates the impact of currency fluctuations and represents local market performance 

3 in 2012 certain gdv from the europe region has been reclassified from all mastercard credit and charge programs to all mastercard debit and prepaid programs the 2011 amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with this presentation there is no impact at the all mastercard programs level   

processed transactions  the table below sets forth the total number of transactions processed by mastercard for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  



participation standards   

we establish and enforce our standards surrounding participation in mastercard and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and application of standards 

participation in the mastercard payments network is generally open to financial institutions and other entities that are our customers applicants for participation must meet specified requirements in general we grant licenses by territory to applicants that meet those specified criteria licenses provide customers with certain rights including access to the network and usage of our brands antimoney laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new customers prior to issuing a license and existing customers are evaluated applying a riskbased approach all customers must meet the requirements of our antimoney laundering program and we can suspend and ultimately terminate participation for noncompliance with the program as a condition of our licenses customers agree to comply with our standards which include requirements in our certificate of incorporation bylaws policies rules and operating regulations and procedures mastercard and certain of our affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and apply our standards which relate to topics such as participation eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of our trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement and customer failures 

customer risk management 

we guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our issuers and acquirers to ensure the integrity of our network settlement exposure we do not however guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirer or the availability of unspent prepaid cardholder balances held by the issuer as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of mastercard maestro and cirrus and affiliate debit licensees our gross settlement exposure for mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded transactions which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 38 billion  as of december 31 2012  principal customers participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers 

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure of a customer to meet its settlement obligations we monitor the financial health of economic and political operating environments of and compliance with our standards by our principal customers affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses if the financial condition of a customer or the state of the economy or political environment in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or to our customers or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants or its obligations to safeguard funds for prepaid cardholders we may require the customer to make operational changes andor post collateral this collateral is typically in the form of a standby letter of credit a bank guarantee or a secured cash account and is required to mitigate our exposure as of december 31 2012  we had customers who had posted approximately 38 billion  in collateral held for settlement exposure if a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other customers we are able to draw upon such customers collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to ourselves or our customers in addition to obtaining collateral from customers in situations where a customer is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other customers we can suspend and ultimately terminate participation in our network additionally and to further preserve payment system integrity we reserve the right to terminate a customers right to participate in our network if for example the customer fails or refuses to make payments in the ordinary course of business or if a liquidating agent conservator or receiver is appointed for the customer or the customer is insolvent in addition to these measures we have also established a 3 billion  committed credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of customer settlement failure see our risk

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payment system can be affected by fraudulent activity and illegal uses of our products and our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information often resulting from security breaches of thirdparty systems that insufficiently protect cardholder data that they store process or transmit see our risk factor in risk factors  business risks in part i item 1a of this report related to account data breaches fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as ecommerce mobile commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt verification through use of a pin or the presence of the card or payment device along with the embedded security features or merchant agent is unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to help ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents key compliance programs include merchant audits for high fraud excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions and security compliance including our mastercard site data protection service® which assists customers merchants and thirdparty service providers in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises by requiring proper adherence to the payment card industry data security standards pci dss and other pci standards designed to secure payment application and terminals our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate 

our customers generally are responsible for fraud losses associated with the products they issue and the merchants from which they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of mastercard products we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help prevent fraud and ensure safety including 

 enterprise risk management   

we face a number of risks in operating our business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this report managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability we have an enterprise risk management “erm” program which is integrated with the business and designed to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of endtoend risk the erm program leverages our business processes to among other things ensure allocation of resources to appropriately address risk establishment of clear accountability for risk management and provision of transparency of risks to senior management including our risk management committee the board of directors and appropriate board committees our erm program seeks to accomplish these goals by identifying prioritizing and monitoring key risks providing an independent view of our risks and strengthening business operations by integrating erm principles and continuing to create a risk aware culture within mastercard our integrated risk management structure balances risk and return by having business units and central functions such as finance and law identify own and manage risks our executive officers set policy and accountability and our board of directors and its committees provide oversight of the process 

intellectual property     

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard® maestro® and cirrus® through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used andor properly maintained through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards contactless mobile electronic commerce security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations patents are of varying duration depending on the jurisdiction and filing date and will typically expire at the end of their natural term 

competition 

general  our programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased and other electronic payments systems and solutions including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use programs contactless mobile and webbased payment platforms and other electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments as a result of a global trend electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment and card brands such as mastercard visa american express and discover are benefiting from this displacement however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume 

cash and check  

 payment card processing and alternative competitors   

 18 

with cardholders these competitors have certain competitive advantages over fourparty payments systems such as ours among other things because these competitors provide an endtoend service they do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs between the issuing and acquiring sides of their business even though they have the ability to internally transfer costs in a manner similar to interchange fees as a result to date operators of endtoend payments networks have generally avoided the same regulatory and legislative scrutiny and litigation challenges we face 

 financial institution customers  

 19 

competitive position  we believe that the principal factors influencing our competitive position in the global payments industry are 

 government regulation     

general government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years including in the united states regulators in several countries outside of the united states have also become increasingly interested in payment issues a number of which have launched official proceedings related to payments industry issues see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

interchange fees   interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world examples include 

 for more detail see our risk factors in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a of this report related to interchange fees and related practices receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the doddfrank act also see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

nosurcharge rules   we have historically implemented policies in certain regions that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means several jurisdictions have indicated interest in either ending or limiting the application of these nosurcharge rules in particular the reserve bank of australia the “rba” had enacted regulations prohibiting the networks from enforcing nosurcharge rules in december 2011 the rba indicated that it would consider allowing certain limitations to a merchants ability to surcharge our nosurcharge rules in canada have also been challenged by the canadian competition bureau in addition to other action being taken in this area pursuant to the terms of settlement of the us merchant class litigation we entered into in october 2012 and subject to final court approval in january 2013 we modified our nosurcharge rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations 

data protection and information security aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commissions information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue certain of our customers in the united states are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers 

regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection in addition the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux in europe the european parliament and council is in the process of revising the european directive 9546ec the “directive” which provides for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data the revised regulation may increase the obligations of controllers entities that have the data relationship with an individual and processors that handle an individuals personal data requiring additional technical and operational measures to protect personal data these and other legislative and regulatory changes as well as the manner in which such laws could be interpreted and applied may be inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in changes to our data practices and could impact such aspects of our business as fraud monitoring and the development of informationbased products and solutions the cost and operational consequences of implementing new andor additional data protection measures could be significant see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a of this report related to regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism mastercard and other participants in the payments industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352 of the usa patriot act which requires us to maintain a comprehensive antimoney laundering “aml” program and imposes similar requirements on our financial institution customers in the united states we are subject to the aml laws and regulations of india and the activities of our internet payments gateway and prepaid card program management services are also subject to us and other countries aml laws and regulations we have an aml compliance program to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks the program is comprised of policies procedures and internal controls including the designation of a compliance officer and providing for the training of appropriate personnel regarding aml responsibilities      

we are subject to regulations imposed by the us office of foreign assets control “ofac” restricting financial transactions and other dealings with cuba iran syria and sudan and with persons and entities included in ofacs list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” cuba iran syria and sudan have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states we have no offices subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license financial institutions domiciled in these countries we have established a riskbased compliance program that includes policies procedures and controls that are designed to protect us against having business dealings with prohibited countries individuals or entities we take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with ofac sanctions including obligating our customers to screen cardholders and merchants against the sdn list however it is possible that such transactions may be processed through our payments system and that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions 

financial industry regulation  we are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” under its authority to examine financial institutions technology service providers examinations by the ffiec cover areas such as data integrity and data security 

additionally in july 2010 as part of the doddfrank act the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” was created the cfpb has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products it is not entirely clear whether andor to what extent the cfpb will regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations in addition the doddfrank act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” in order to identify risks to the financial stability of the united states that could arise from the material financial distress or failure of or ongoing activities by large interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies among other responsibilities the fsoc is tasked with identifying payment clearing and settlement systems that are “systemically important” under the applicable statutory standard under the doddfrank act such systems will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements to date mastercard has not been designated “systemically important” however the imposition of any additional regulatory or other obligations on mastercard could result in costly new compliance burdens that could negatively impact our business see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a related to the doddfrank act 

retail payments system regulation  regulators in several countries such as australia mexico colombia india singapore russia ukraine and indonesia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries such authority includes or could include providing broad regulatory oversight over retail payments system operators to the central banks in such countries and could result in regulation of various aspects of the payments system for example india has created a national domestic debit switch and has created a licensing regime with oversight over all payments system operators in india in belgium mastercard europe is subject to oversight as a retail payments system operator in europe by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk additionally in the european union the european commission announced its intention to propose legislation in the second quarter of 2013 that addresses several elements of the payments industry   

national payments systems  governments in some countries may act to provide resources or preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payment card and processing providers or may create a domestic payment provider this action could develop due to a countrys broad oversight of retail payments systems such as in russia ukraine and india it could also develop as a result of legislative activity this action could displace us from or prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a related to government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments or processing services in certain countries 

issuer practice regulation our customers are subject to numerous regulations and legislation applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere in their capacity as issuers and otherwise and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations for example in the united states in 2009 the federal reserve adopted regulations addressing overdraft fees imposed in connection with atm and debit card transactions additionally the cfpb launched an investigation into bank overdraft practices in 2012 and it remains to be seen whether the cfpb investigation will result in further regulation in this area any new regulation in this area may further restrict the ability of our customers to charge overdraft fees in connection with debit programs which may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our customers and adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues additionally regulation of issuer practices around the world include regulation of the issuance of prepaid cards in germany additional consumer information is required in connection with prepaid transactions which could restrict the issuance of prepaid cards in india prepaid cards not associated with a bank cannot be issued any similar regulation restricting issuance of prepaid cards and devices could directly impact our business and our volumes 

regulation of internet transactions  in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payments system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is implemented through a federal regulation the federal law requires us and our customers to implement compliance programs also congress may consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate internet gambling that could increase our costs andor could decrease our transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes 

additional regulatory developments   various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly new requirements and developments may affect our customers ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as premium and prepaid cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth

 item 1a   risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks   

interchange fees and acceptance practices receive significant and intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations   

interchange fees which represent a sharing of a portion of payments system costs among the issuers and acquirers participating in a fourparty payments system are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant financial institution the acquirer to the cardholder financial institution the issuer in connection with transactions initiated on our payments system interchange fees play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants pay in a fourparty payments system they are also a factor on which we compete with other payment providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process over our network we do not earn revenues from interchange fees    we have historically set default interchange fees in the united states and certain other countries in some jurisdictions our interchange fees and related practices are subject to legislation regulation and litigation as electronic forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries as well as merchants are seeking to reduce these fees through legislation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation andor litigation

 examples of competitionrelated regulatory proceedings or inquiries around the world with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices include 

 examples of regulation or potential regulation by central banks and similar types of regulatory authorities around the world with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices include 

 see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a detailed description of regulatory proceedings and inquiries into interchange fees we believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in this part i item 1a related to the impact of new regulations or other legislative or regulatory activity in one jurisdiction or of one product 

additionally merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees and impact acceptance rules through litigation such litigation includes 

 see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees issuers will be unable to use interchange fees to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payments system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services thereby making our card programs less desirable to consumers and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability in addition issuers could attempt to decrease the expense of their card and other payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge to them this could also result in less innovation and fewer product offerings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have a more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to its competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees any such legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

the doddfrank act may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations   

the doddfrank act enacted in the united states includes provisions that provide for the regulation by the federal reserve of debit and prepaid interchange fees and certain other network industry practices among other things it requires debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” referred to in the doddfrank act as fees established charged or received by a payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in an electronic debit transaction to be “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction” additionally it provides that neither an issuer nor a payment card network may establish exclusive network arrangements for debit or prepaid cards or inhibit the ability of a merchant to choose among different networks for routing debit or prepaid transactions 

in october 2011 federal reserve regulations went into effect implementing these provisions in accordance with the doddfrank act with certain exceptions for issuer compliance with the exclusivity requirements the regulations limit pertransaction us debit and prepaid interchange fees to 21 cents plus five basis points the issuer may receive a fraud prevention adjustment of an additional one cent if it meets certain requirements the interchange limitations are a significant reduction from average interchange fees in effect before the regulations were implemented the regulations contain exemptions from the interchange limitations for issuers that together with their affiliates have less than 10 billion in assets as well as for debit cards issued pursuant to a governmentadministered payment program and certain reloadable prepaid cards also while the regulations do not directly regulate network fees they make clear that network fees cannot be used to circumvent the interchange fee restrictions see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in this part i item 1a with respect to interchange fees and related practices receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide issuers are required to file various types of information regarding debit and prepaid transactions with the federal reserve every two years beginning in 2013 and such information could be used by the federal reserve to reexamine and potentially reset the interchange cap with respect to network arrangements and transaction routing the regulations require debit and prepaid cards to be enabled with two unaffiliated payments networks the regulations also provide that an issuer or payments network may not inhibit the ability of any person that accepts or honors a debit or prepaid card to direct the routing of the card transaction for processing over any network enabled on the card 

the doddfrank act also created two new independent regulatory bodies  the cfpb and fsoc the cfpb has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products it is not yet entirely clear whether andor to what extent the cfpb will regulate broader aspects of payments network operations the fsoc is tasked among other responsibilities with identifying “systemically important” payment clearing and settlement systems that will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements to date mastercard has not been designated “systemically important” under the applicable standard if mastercard were designated “systemically important” it would be subject to new risk management regulations relating to its payment clearing and settlement activities new regulations could address areas such as risk management policies and procedures collateral requirements participant default policies and procedures the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transactions and capital and financial resource requirements also a “systemically important” payments system could be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve or another federal agency for changes to its system rules procedures or operations that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payments system these developments or actions could increase the cost of operating our business and may make electronic payment transactions less attractive to card issuers as well as consumers this could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues 

if issuers acquirers andor merchants modify their business operations or otherwise take actions in response to this legislation which have the result of reducing the number of debit or prepaid transactions we process or the network fees we collect the doddfrank act could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations failure by our customers or us to adjust our strategies successfully to compete in the new environment would increase this impact 

we recently entered into an agreement to settle the current us merchant class litigation that among other things requires us to not restrict us merchants subject to certain conditions from surcharging credit card transactions which could impact the use of electronic payments and result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and could in turn materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have historically implemented policies referred to as nosurcharge rules in certain regions including the united states that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard products instead of other means as part of the terms of the settlement of the us merchant class litigation entered into by the company in october 2012 and subject to final court approval the company and visa have modified their nosurcharge or comparable rules to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations including ensuring that mastercard or visa cardholders are not unfairly subject to surcharging relative to cardholders of competing credit card networks such as american express discover and paypal should those networks enforce rules that restrict surcharging it is possible that over time us merchants in some or all merchant categories may choose to surcharge as permitted by the rule change which could make credit card programs less desirable to consumers in the united states in the event that such merchants surcharge credit cards this could result in consumers having a less favorable view of our products andor using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

new regulations or other legislative or regulatory activity with respect to the payments industry in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations or impact pending regulatory proceedings in other jurisdictions or of other products 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each others approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions for example the december 2007 european commission decision with respect to crossborder interchange fees could also lead to additional competition authorities in european member states commencing investigations or proceedings regarding domestic interchange fees or initiating regulation the general courts judgment in may 2012 upholding the european commissions decision has increased the possibility of such actions as well as the possibility of an adverse outcome for us in related and pending matters similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations affecting debit transactions such as the federal reserves final rules implementing the doddfrank act could lead to regulation of other consumer products including credit see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in this part i item 1a with respect to government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payment services in certain countries 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product these include matters like interchange rates network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business with the same effect either of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

government actions preferring or protecting providers of domestic payment services in certain countries may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in some countries such as china russia ukraine and india could act or have acted to provide resources or preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and processing providers or may otherwise create or have created its own national provider these governments may take this action to support these providers they may also take action to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies as an example governments in some countries are considering or may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies such a development would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for customers our efforts to effect change in or work with these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volumes and revenues 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards and other devices are used in particular many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently we are at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “businessgovernment regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation in addition to the doddfrank act examples include 

 27 

increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which could reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations as well as have an impact on our reputation 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards and devices issued and could increase our costs 

we are subject to regulations related to privacy and data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations recently these topics have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in jurisdictions around the world in particular in europe where the european directive 9546ec is in the process of being revised regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may raise concerns and scrutiny of our practices in regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information failure to comply with the privacy and data protection and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation any additional or changes to regulations in these areas as well as the manner in which such laws could be interpreted or applied may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations changes to these laws could also impact our business operations by requiring changes to our data practices and could impact aspects of our business such as fraud monitoring and the development of informationbased products and solutions in addition these regulations may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment products which may in turn decrease the number of our cards and other payment devices that they issue any of these changes could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations   

we are a defendant on a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations including among others those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings except as otherwise discussed in note 18 we have not established reserves for any of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future in the event we are found liable in any of these material litigations or proceedings particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damages which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation for example as described above as part of the terms of the settlement of the us merchant class litigation entered into by the company in october 2012 and subject to final court approval the company and visa modified their nosurcharge rules in january 2013 to permit us merchants to surcharge credit cards subject to certain limitations including ensuring that mastercard or visa cardholders are not unfairly subject to surcharging relative to cardholders of competing credit card networks such as american express discover and paypal should those networks enforce rules that restrict surcharging any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

potential changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

potential changes in existing tax laws such as recent proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states including the treatment of earnings of controlled foreign corporations may impact our effective tax rate and tax payments this could adversely impact our results of operations see also note 17 income tax to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

business risks   

substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased or other electronic payment programs or systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use programs contactless mobile and webbased payment platforms and other electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments within the global general purpose payments industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa american express discover unionpay jcb and paypal among others visa has greater volume than we do and has greater scale and market share as well as strong brand recognition which may provide significant competitive advantages moreover some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcomes of litigation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank activity and legislative activity 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate endtoend payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of endtoend payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition even when they operate programs that utilize a fourparty system these competitors have not attracted the same level of regulatory or legislative scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a fourparty system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not we could lose business to these competitors certain competitors may also hold competitive advantages as a result of their organizational structures see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth our customers can also develop their own competitive services we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payments systems ecommerce payments systems and payments systems for mobile devices as well as physical store locations a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

potential future changes in the competitive landscape including disintermediation from other participants in the payments value chain also could harm our business   

we also expect that there may be other changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 29 

our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations   

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our products in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors in addition customers principally aligned with one of our competitors may outperform customers principally aligned with us a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for us and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers resulting in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations   

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor significant consolidation in the banking industry may result in the substantial loss of business for us which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business 

consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which we have a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

if we lose a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term which could have a material adverse longterm impact on our business     

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with these customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2012 the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 18 billion  or 24  of total revenue loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

merchants continue to be focused on the costs of accepting electronic forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

merchants are an important constituency in our payments system and we rely on both our relationships with them as well as their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards and payment devices consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard has been defending including the us merchant litigations as to which the company recently entered into a settlement agreement subject to final court approval see our risk factor in this part i item 1a with respect to interchange fees and related practices receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide also see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in this part i item 1a with respect to the doddfrank act the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards and devices as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives 

certain customers have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and may have a material adverse impact on our business   

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment products and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payments system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our products for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected   

while we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system including merchants and governments we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards or other payment devices extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using our products each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payments system among consumers in these countries we also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries alongside our own relationships with these stakeholders from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our results of operations 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards and other payment devices carrying our 

brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our products and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

the marketplaces perception of our brands and reputation may materially and adversely affect our overall business   

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to our branded products depends highly upon the external perception of us and our industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances such use could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our overall business 

unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations   

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil countries have experienced credit ratings actions by rating agencies including several in europe as well as the united states in addition some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our products and cardholders who use our products have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercards financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue may be negatively impacted or we may be impacted in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 32 

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations 

a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our results of operations as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions   

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and transaction processing fees revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with crossborder travel and our customers need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases any such decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our results of operations 

general economic and global political conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our results of operations   

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending as well as the impact of events in the united states such as the upcoming deadline on the debt limit in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our payment cards and devices also as we are principally based in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business 

as a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of principal customers and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity     

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons if a principal customer or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss in addition although we are not obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations or to keep prepaid cardholders whole if an issuer defaults on its obligation to safeguard unspent prepaid funds our mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded gross legal settlement exposure which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 38 billion  as of december 31 2012 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 3 billion  which could be used for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in the event that mastercard effects a payment on behalf of a failed customer mastercard may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables from the failed customer subject to approval by our board of directors customers may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during these ordinary course activities of mastercard while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited as a result concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our overall business in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations moreover during 2012 many of our financial institution customers continued to be directly and adversely impacted by the unprecedented events in the financial markets which began during 2008 and the economic turmoil that has ensued the european financial crisis remains a heightened concern our aggregate gross settlement exposures to greece italy portugal and spain four of the countries most significantly impacted by the eurozone crisis are less than 5  of our total gross settlement 

exposure and are being managed through various planning and risk mitigation practices nonetheless these conditions present increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees 

separately mastercard also provides guarantees to certain customers and other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures of third parties to perform for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices as of december 31 2012 see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses 

information security risks for payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threats include cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious code phishing attacks or information security breaches 

our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks our customers and other parties in the payments value chain as well as our cardholders rely on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct their operations in addition to access our products and services our customers and cardholders increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pcs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control systems we routinely receive cyberthreats and our technologies systems and networks have been subject to cyberattacks because of our position in the payments value chain we believe that such threats may continue and that we are likely to continue to be a target of such attacks 

to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however if one or more of these events occurs it could lead to security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services which could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromises such events could also cause service interruptions malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure or operations systems that support our businesses and customers such as the lack of availability of our valueadded systems as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties any actual attacks could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers and other parties and the market additional costs to mastercard such as repairing systems adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs regulatory penalties financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded 

we maintain an information security program a business continuity program and insurance coverage and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks we also test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities despite these mitigation efforts there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats the prominent size and scale of mastercard and our role in the global payments and technology industries our plans to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers and cardholders when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of third party vendors and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunities as a result cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 

if our transaction processing systems and other services are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions or service our customers efficiently or at all our results of operations would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems and other key service offerings may experience interruptions as a result of a disaster including but not limited to technology malfunctions fire weather events power outages telecommunications disruptions terrorism workplace violence accidents or other catastrophic events our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists activists or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities andor systems a disaster that occurs at or in the vicinity of our primary andor backup facilities in any global location could interrupt our services although 

we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks 

additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially reduce our results of operations 

account data breaches involving card data stored processed or transmitted by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 

we our issuers and acquirers merchants and other third parties process transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards and devices in addition our customers may sponsor or we may certify as pcicompliant thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage our reputation and lead to claims against us as well as subject us to regulatory actions we routinely encounter account data compromise events some of which have been high profile involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affect millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of cardholders these events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants or thirdparty processors systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the servers as a result of such data security breaches we may be subject to reputational damage andor lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands while most of these lawsuits do not involve direct claims against us we could face damage claims in various circumstances which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our results of operations damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes results of operations and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands andor regulatory intervention which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards or misconduct or negligence by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

rapid technological developments in our industry present both operational and legal challenges including potential intellectual property exposure which could impact our results of operations or limit our future growth   

the payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless payment devices electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards and by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes by the complexity of our systems our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from patent holders for example other operating companies or nonpracticing entities suggesting that we may be infringing certain patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us or demand significant license fees our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    failure to keep pace with these technological developments could lead to a decline in the use of our products which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations 

during 2012 approximately 61  of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies 

in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar if the us dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars 

the occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation   

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies in addition the integration of any acquisition or investment including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity may divert managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition any acquisition or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations with which we would need to comply and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements our expansion into new businesses could also result in unanticipated issues which may be difficult to manage although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions 

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure   

future sales of our shares of class a common stock could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future as of february 7 2013  we had 117961825  outstanding shares of class a common stock of which 12378831  shares were owned by the mastercard foundation the “foundation” under the terms of the donation of these shares by mastercard to the foundation the foundation became able to sell its shares of our class a common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo in may 2006 to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements under canadian tax law the foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 35 of its assets not used in administration of the foundation in qualified charitable disbursements despite permission from the canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to 15 years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the 15year period the foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year     

the market price of our common stock could be volatile 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations and have experienced increased volatility in connection with recent unpredictable economic events around the world this market volatility as well as the factors listed below among others could affect the market price of our common stock 

 36 

 there are terms in our charter documents and under delaware law that could be considered antitakeover provisions or could have an impact on a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further except in limited circumstances no customer or former customer of mastercard or any operator customer or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

as of february 7 2013  the foundation owns 12378831  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 105  of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to april 26 2026 twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements for which purpose earlier sales are permitted the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our holders of class a common stock and class b common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

mastercard intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely the payment of dividends is dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs if as a 

consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make or may have to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock

 overview 

we recorded net income of 28 billion  or 2194  per diluted share in 2012  versus net income of 19 billion  or 1485  per diluted share in 2011  and net income of 18 billion  or 1405  per diluted share in 2010  our 2011 net income was significantly impacted by the 770 million portion of the mdl provision 495 million after tax recorded in 2011 in 2012 the company increased the provision by 20 million 13 million after tax 

in 2012 net revenue grew at 10  compared to net revenue growth of 21  in 2011 revenue growth in both 2012 and 2011 was driven primarily by growth in the volume of transactions and the number of transactions we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands in 2012 volumebased revenues domestic assessments and crossborder volume fees and transactionbased revenues transaction processing fees increased compared to 2011 by 13  in 2012 our processed transactions increased 25  and our mastercard branded gross dollar volume gdv increased 15  on a local currency basis this compares to increased processed transactions of 18  and increased gdv of 16  on a local currency basis in 2011 overall net revenue growth for 2012 and 2011 was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 27  25  and 27  in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we generated net cash flows from operations of 29 billion  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to 27 billion  and 17 billion  for the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively operating expenses in 2012 decreased 547 million  or 14  from 2011 and increased in 2011 12 billion  or 44  from 2010 primarily due to the 2011 portion of the mdl provision 

the following table provides a summary of our operating results for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010

1  operating margin is defined as operating income divided by revenues net our operating margin was negatively impacted by 1 percentage point and 12 percentage points for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively due to the mdl provision 

business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies net revenue generated in the united states was 39  40  and 42  of total net revenue in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period but differences in market growth economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies including several in europe as well as the united states in addition some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies the condition of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue may be negatively impacted or the company may be impacted in several ways mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry for example in our asia pacific and latin american regions we continue to see significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the united states and europe we have experienced growth in dollar volume despite mixed economic indicators notwithstanding recent encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business for a full discussion see risk factors  business risk in part i item 1a of this report 

in addition our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a of this report for further discussion further information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years although to date we have 

not experienced any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future see our risk factor in risk factors  business risks in part i item 1a of this report related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyberattacks 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar for 2012 as compared to 2011 the us dollar strengthened against both the euro and the brazilian real for 2011 compared to 2010 the us dollar weakened against both the euro and the brazilian real accordingly the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real decreased net income in 2012 compared to 2011 by 7  percentage points conversely net income in 2011 was positively impacted by currency by approximately 2  percentage points 

in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gdv and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus primarily noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2012 gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 12  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 15  in 2011 gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 19  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 16  the company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 20 foreign exchange risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

the company generates revenues and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the us dollar 

acquisitions 

on april 15 2011 mastercard acquired the prepaid card program management operations of travelex holdings ltd since renamed access prepaid worldwide “access” at a purchase price of 295 million uk pound sterling or 481 million including adjustments for working capital with contingent consideration an “earnout” of up to an additional 35 million uk pound sterling or approximately 57 million if certain performance targets were met see note 2 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report through access mastercard manages and delivers consumer and corporate prepaid travel cards through business partners around the world including financial institutions retailers travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus access has enabled mastercard to offer endtoend prepaid card solutions encompassing branded switching issuer processing and program management services primarily focused on the travel sector and in markets outside the united states 

on october 22 2010 mastercard acquired all the outstanding shares of datacash group plc “datacash” a payment service provider with operations in europe and brazil at a purchase price of 334 million uk pound sterling or 534 million datacash provides ecommerce merchants with the ability to process secure payments across the world datacash develops and provides outsourced electronic payments solutions fraud prevention alternative payment options backoffice reconciliation and solutions for merchants selling via multiple channels mastercard believes the acquisition of datacash creates a longterm growth platform in the ecommerce category while enhancing existing mastercard payment products and expanding its global presence in the internet gateway business 

financial results 

revenues 

revenue description 

mastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders merchants issuers the cardholders’ financial institutions and acquirers the merchants’ financial institutions our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other paymentrelated services we provide to our customers our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro and brazilian real 

our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers the following factors impact pricing 

 in general a crossborder transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since crossborder fees are higher than domestic fees and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion 

we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis in addition standard pricing varies among our regions and such standard pricing can be modified for our customers through customerspecific incentive and rebate agreements 

the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories 

 44 

 revenue analysis 

in 2012  and 2011  gross revenues increased 12  billion and 14  billion or 13  and 18  respectively revenue growth in 2012 and 2011 was primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions 

rebates and incentives in 2012  and 2011  increased 488  million and 202  million or 22  and 10  versus 2011  and 2010  respectively our net revenues in 2012  and 2011  increased 10  and 21  versus 2011  and 2010  respectively 

our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes which are driven by the number of transactions and the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands in 2012  our processed transactions increased 25  and our gdv increased 15  on a local currency basis in 2011  our processed transactions increased 18  and our gdv increased 16  on a local currency basis the acquisitions of access and datacash contributed approximately 3   to our net revenue growth in 2011 there was no significant impact on net revenue growth in 2012 from additional acquisitions the effects of pricing actions implemented in 2012 and 2011 contributed approximately 3  and 2  percentage points to our net revenue growth for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume growth 



1  gdv generated by maestro and cirrus cards is not included in the measurement of the growth rate 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2012 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 18 billion  or 24  of total net revenues the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see our risk factor in risk factor  business risks in part i item 1a of this report for further discussion 

the significant components of our net revenues for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  were as follows 



the following table summarizes the primary drivers of net revenue growth in 2012 versus 2011 and 2011 versus 2010

5  rebates and incentives other includes the impact from new and renewed agreements and reductions from terminated and expired agreements 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing depreciation and amortization expenses and in 2012 and 2011 the respective amounts recorded for the mdl provision operating expenses decreased in 2012 by 547 million  or 14  primarily due to the 770 million  portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2011 versus the 20 million  portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2012 operating expenses increased 12 billion  or 44  in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the 770 million  portion of the mdl provision and higher general and administrative expenses including expenses related to recent acquisitions excluding the impact of the mdl provision operating expenses increased 203 million or 6 in 2012 compared to 2011 and 445 million or 16 in 2011 compared to 2010 acquisitions contributed approximately 6 percentage points to the increase in operating expenses in 2011 

the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses excluding the annual portion of the mdl provision which is a nongaap financial measure to the operating expenses including the annual portion of the mdl provision which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement management believes this analysis facilitates understanding of our ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods 



general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 233 million  or 11  in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily driven by increased personnel costs the net impact of currency hedging activities and the remeasurement of financial assets denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity holding those assets general and administrative expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 by 339 million  or 18  primarily due to increases related to acquisitions primarily in personnel and other expenses the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of general and administrative expenses from our functional currencies to us dollars reduced general and administrative expenses by approximately 2  percentage points in 2012 and increased general and administrative expenses by approximately 1  percentage point in 2011

fund future settlement payments to the class merchants there were no comparable charges in 2010 see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 36 million  or 18  in 2012 and 46 million or 31 in 2011 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in both 2012 and 2011 is primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software costs 

other income expense 

other income expense was comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses the decrease of total other income expense in 2012 versus 2011 of 38 million  was primarily due to lower investment income increased expenses from investments in joint ventures and an adjustment to the earnout related to the companys acquisition of access in 2011 see note 2 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report the increase of total other income in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in the interest accretion on litigation settlements and an adjustment to the earnout related to the companys acquisition of access partially offset by expenses from equity method investments 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  were 299  306  and 330  respectively the effective tax rate for 2012 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2011 primarily due to discrete benefits related to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions as well as a larger benefit from the domestic production activities deduction in the us related to our authorization software the effective tax rate for 2011 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2010 primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings including the tax benefit related to the 2011 portion of the mdl provision and the recognition of discrete adjustments in 2011 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35  to pretax income for the years ended december 31  as a result of the following 



the companys gaap effective tax rate for 2011 was affected by the tax benefits related to the 2011 portion of the mdl provision due to the nature of this item the company believes that the calculation of the 2011 effective tax rate excluding the impact of the mdl provision facilitates meaningful comparison of the effective tax rate for 2011 the effective tax rate was 299  in 2012 including and excluding the portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2012 



during 2012 the companys unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by 43 million  the increase in the companys unrecognized tax benefits for 2012 is primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions as of december 31 2012 the companys unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were 257 million  all of which would reduce the companys effective tax rate if recognized 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of the companys operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region the companys subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance see note 17 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures to make continued investments in our business and to service our current and potential obligations the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations the following table summarizes our cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal years presented as well as the cash cash equivalents and investment securities balances and credit available to the company at december 31 



1  the 2012 balance excludes 726 million  held in escrow to fund the companys share of the us merchant class litigation 

2  the company did not use any funds from the line of credit during the periods presented except for business continuity planning and related purposes 

the increase in net cash provided by operations is primarily due to increases in net income in 2012 and 2011 cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to us tax upon repatriation was 25 billion  and 18 billion  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively or 50  and 37  of our total cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment securities as of such dates it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2012  outside of the united states as disclosed in note 17 income tax to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings if these earnings are needed for us operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states the company would be subject to us tax upon repatriation 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions the company guarantees the settlement of many of the mastercard cirrus and maestro branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers see note 19 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for a description of these guarantees historically payments under these guarantees have not been significant however historical trends may not be an indication of the future the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions including but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region 

our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see our risk factor in risk factors  legal and regulatory risks in part i item 1a and note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and part ii item 7 business environment of this report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

cash flow 

the table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 



the table below shows a summary of the balance sheet data at december 31 



net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 29 billion  versus 27 billion  for the comparable period in 2011  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily due to net income net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to net income and the increase in accrued litigation related to the 770 million  portion of the mdl provision partially offset by litigation settlement payments of 303 million  

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily related to purchases of investment securities and the payment related to us merchant class litigations into escrow partially offset by net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily related to purchases of investment securities the acquisition of access and expenditures for our global payments network partially offset by net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities 

net cash used in financing activities for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 primarily related to the repurchase of the company’s class a common stock and dividend payments to our stockholders 

the company believes that its existing cash cash equivalents and investment securities balances its cash flow generating capabilities its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs capital asset purchases outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential obligations 

credit availability 

on november 16 2012 the company entered into a committed fiveyear unsecured 3 billion  revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which expires on november 16 2017 the credit facility replaced the companys prior credit facility borrowings under the credit facility are available to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the companys customers in addition for business continuity planning and related purposes we may borrow and repay amounts under the credit facility from time to time the facility fee and borrowing cost under the credit facility are contingent upon the companys credit rating at december 31 2012 the applicable facility fee was 10 basis points on the average daily commitment whether or not utilized in addition to the facility fee interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be charged at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin of 90 basis points or an alternative base rate mastercard had no borrowings under the credit facility or prior credit facility at december 31 2012 and 2011 

the credit facility contains customary representations warranties events of default and affirmative and negative covenants including a financial covenant limiting the maximum level of consolidated debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization mastercard was in compliance in all material respects with the covenants of the credit facility and prior credit facility at december 31 2012 and 2011 the majority of credit facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of mastercard 

on august 2 2012 the company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital if needed pursuant to the shelf registration statement the company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities preferred stock class a common stock depository shares purchase contracts units or warrants in one or more offerings 

dividends and share repurchases 

mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock subject to legally available funds we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs the following table summarizes the annual per share dividends paid in the years reflected 



on december 4 2012 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 030 per share paid on february 8 2013 to holders of record on january 9 2013 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend was 37 million  

on february 5 2013 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 060 per share payable on may 9 2013 to holders of record on april 9 2013 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be 74 million 

shares in the companys common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the operating needs of the business legal requirements price and economic and market conditions the following table summarizes the companys share repurchase authorizations of its class a common stock through december 31 2012 as well as historical purchases 



 not applicable 

1   the initial authorization in september 2010 for 1 billion was amended in april 2011 to increase the authorization to 2 billion 

as of january 25 2013  the cumulative repurchases by the company under the june 2012 share repurchase program totaled approximately 23 million  shares of its class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately 11 billion  at an average price of 46744  per share of class a common stock 

on february 5 2013 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 2 billion  of its class a common stock the new share repurchase program will become effective at the completion of the companys june 2012 share repurchase program 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

mastercard has no offbalance sheet debt other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2012  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



1  the capital lease for the global technology and operations center located in o’fallon missouri has been excluded from this table since the company holds refunding revenue bonds equal to the payments due on the lease see note 7 property plant and equipment included in part ii item 8 of this report for further information 

2  the table does not include the 726 million  provision as of december 31 2012 related to the proposed settlement of the us merchant class litigation since the company has made a payment into escrow to fund the settlement see note 18 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

3  amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand and amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements that are fixed and noncancelable future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance mastercard has accrued 11 billion  as of december 31 2012  related to customer and merchant agreements 

4  the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of 257 million  at december 31 2012 and estimates that approximately 2 million  of this liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2012 2011 or 2010 accounted for more than 30 of net revenues 

critical accounting estimates 

the application of us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the companys reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the companys financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors the companys significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity eg 10 percent are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent managements predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

rebates and incentives 

rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates of each customers future performance according to the terms of the related customer agreements we consider various factors in estimating customer performance including a review of specific transactions historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions differences between actual results and the companys estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance 

if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance contrarevenues may be materially different than initially estimated if the companys estimate of customer performance was 10 higher net revenue would have been reduced by approximately 25 million in 2012 

loss contingencies 

the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

income taxes 

in calculating our effective tax rate we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions through our interpretation of local tax regulations adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 

we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and if so how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements if upon examination we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situations the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 

we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations we consider business plans planning opportunities and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 

valuation of assets 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets the company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company early adopted new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance that simplifies how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allowing a qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and the companys market capitalization if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit 

or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts the company must perform a quantitative impairment test after performing the annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment qualitative reviews during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company determined it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis the effect of a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately 166 million  on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2012  related to the hedging program a 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the companys financial assets or liabilities at december 31 2012  and 2011  in addition there was no material equity price risk at december 31 2012  or 2011  the doddfrank act includes provisions related to derivative financial instruments and the company is determining what impact if any such provisions will have on the companys financial position or results of operations 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies we also enter into forward contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the assets and liabilities the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the notional value of commitments to sell foreign currency increased to 16 billion  at december 31 2012  compared to 279 million  at december 31 2011  due to the hedging of an increase in assets denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity holding the assets and an expanded hedging program to offset the companys foreign currency exposures arising from anticipated receipts and disbursements the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months 

as of december 31 2012  all forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency had been entered into with customers of mastercard mastercard’s derivative contracts are summarized below   



our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the companys available for sale investments as of december 31 was as follows 



1 shortterm bond funds of 210 million have no contractual maturity 



1 shortterm bond funds of 203 million have no contractual maturity 

at december 31 2012  we have a credit facility which provides liquidity for general corporate purposes including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the companys customers this credit facility has variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement see note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on the companys current and prior credit facilities we had no borrowings under the current or prior credit facilities at december 31 2012  or 2011  

equity price risk 

the company did not have significant equity price risk as of december 31 2012  and 2011

 item 1   business 

overview   

mastercard is a global payments and technology company that connects billions of consumers thousands of financial institutions millions of merchants governments and businesses worldwide enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks we envision an environment where electronic payment is the predominant means of payment we use our technology and expertise to make payments more convenient secure and efficient to enable consumers to meet their needs and to provide value to all stakeholders in the payments system 

we offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable our customers and partners to develop and implement credit debit prepaid and related payment programs and solutions to deliver value to consumers our customers and partners include financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers” merchants government entities telecommunications companies and other businesses we manage a family of wellknown widelyaccepted payment brands including mastercard® maestro® and cirrus® which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs and solutions we process payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network and provide support services to our customers and other partners as part of managing our brands we establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network 

mastercard generates revenue by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity or gross dollar volume “gdv” on the cards and other devices that carry our brands 

  

a typical transaction processed over our network involves four parties in addition to us the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholders financial institution and the acquirer the merchants financial institution consequently the payment network we operate supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers who are our customers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient quick and secure payment method that is accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customers to ensure the integrity of our payment network in addition we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands we partner with merchants on initiatives to help provide value to them and benefits to consumers however cardholder and merchant transaction relationships are managed principally by our customers we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the “merchant discount” charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

our business has a global reach and has continued to experience growth in 2011 we processed 273 billion  transactions a 183  increase over the number of transactions processed in 2010 gdv on cards carrying the mastercard brand as reported by our customers was approximately 32 trillion  in 2011 a 161  increase in local currency terms and a 193  increase in us dollar terms over the gdv reported in 2010 

  

we analyze our ability to grow based on three drivers 

 

we support our focus on these drivers by continuing to 

 

 

 

we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment in recent years we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny and other legal challenges including legislation particularly with respect to interchange fees interchange fees which represent a balancing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers and in turn among merchants and cardholders have been the subject of regulatory review and challenges and legislative action as well as litigation as electronic forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers we do not earn revenues from interchange fees see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

the global payments industry    

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

  

 

 

 

 

the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 

 

   

the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard visa® american express® jcb® diners club® unionpay® and discover® these brands including mastercard have come to be associated with a variety of forms of payment in the united states and other markets around the world including depending on the brand credit charge debit and prepaid cards regional and domesticlocal debit brands that require a personal identification number “pin” for verification are the primary brands in many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and other brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions 

  

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a portion of all cardbased forms of payment typically private label cards are credit cards issued by or on behalf of a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at that merchants locations 

payment services and solutions 

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services as well as a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design package and implement products and programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers we work with customers to provide customized solutions as well as more general solutions our payment solutions are built upon our expertise in payment programs product development payment processing technology payment security consulting and information services and marketing    we also manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through brand advertising promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives 

transaction processing on the mastercard worldwide network   

introduction   we operate the mastercard worldwide network our proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide we process transactions through our network for financial institutions and other entities that are our customers in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories 

typical transaction  a typical transaction processed over the mastercard worldwide network involves four participants in addition to us cardholder merchant issuer the cardholders financial institution and acquirer the merchants financial institution the following diagram depicts a typical pointofinteraction card transaction 

  

in a typical transaction a cardholder a purchases goods or services from a merchant b using a card or other payment device after the transaction is authorized by the issuer d using our network the issuer pays the acquirer c an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and posts the transaction to the cardholders account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount referred to as the “merchant discount” to the merchant the merchant discount among other things takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee we generally guarantee the payment of transactions using mastercardbranded products and certain transactions using cirrus and maestrobranded products between issuers and acquirers 

interchange fees   the interchange fee is equal to the difference between the amount of the payment transaction the transaction amount and the amount the issuer pays the acquirer the settlement amount interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payment system costs among the customers participating in our fourparty payment card system as such interchange fees are a key factor in balancing the costs consumers pay and the costs merchants pay we do not earn revenues from interchange fees generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers or netted by issuers against amounts paid to acquirers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers to acquirers we establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process interchange fees can be a significant component of the merchant discount and therefore of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards these fees are currently subject to regulatory legislative andor legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

merchant discount   the merchant discount is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of participating in the fourparty system and generally to provide for a profit margin with respect to services rendered to the merchant the discount takes into 

consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer and the balance of the discount consists of fees established by the acquirer and paid by the merchant for certain of the acquirers services to the merchant 

additional fees and economic considerations   among the parties in a fourparty system various types of fees may be charged to different constituents for various services for example acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers transactionbased and related fees for the transaction processing and related services we provide them 

in a fourparty payment system the economics of a payment transaction relative to mastercard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over our network or a thirdparty network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

authentication  generally transactions processed over our network can be authenticated at the point of interaction and across the processing value chain a typical transaction processed over our network can be authenticated in several ways depending on the type of card or device being used 

 

 

 

in addition some payment cards and devices are equipped with an rfid radio frequency identification microchip which provides an advanced authentication technique and technology which allows contactless payments requiring neither signature nor pin under established maximum transaction amounts 

  

mastercard worldwide network architecture and operations  we believe the architecture of the mastercard worldwide network is unique featuring a globally integrated structure that provides scalability for our customers and enables them to expand into regional and global markets our network also features an intelligent architecture that enables it to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structuresdistributed peertopeer and centralized hubandspoke transactions that require fast reliable processing such as those submitted using a mastercard paypass®enabled device in a tollway use the networks distributed processing structure ensuring they are processed close to where the transaction occurred transactions that require valueadded processing such as realtime access to transaction data for fraud scoring or rewards at the pointofsale or customization of transaction data for unique consumerspending controls use the networks centralized processing structure ensuring advanced processing services are applied to the transaction through the unique architecture of our network we are able to connect all parties with respect to payments transactions regardless of whether the transaction is occurring at a traditional physical location at an atm on the internet or through a mobile device enabling electronic commerce 

the network typically operates at under 80 capacity and has the capacity to handle more than 160 million transactions per hour with an average network response time of 130 milliseconds the network can also substantially scale capacity to meet demand our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year our global payment network provides multiple levels of backup protection and related continuity procedures should the issuer acquirer or payment network experience a service interruption moreover the network features multiple layers of protection against hacking or other cybersecurity attacks we supplement this protection with mitigation efforts to strengthen our protection against such threats both in terms of operability of the network and protection of the information transmitted through the network to date we have consistently maintained availability of our global processing systems more than 999 of the time

additional services   in addition we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are 

payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline mobile operator or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuers marketing partner is typically a charitable educational or other nonprofit organization 

merchants   merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard in particular large merchants are supporting many of the litigation legislative and regulatory challenges related to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending against since interchange fees can represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” and “risk factorsbusiness risksmerchants continue to be focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in part i item 1a

mastercard revenue sources     

mastercard generates revenues by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and assessing our customers based on gdv on the cards that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted both by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards carrying our brands our net revenues are classified into the following five categories 

 

 

 

 

 

our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers a combination of the following factors determines the pricing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in general crossborder transactions generate higher revenue than domestic transactions since crossborder fees are higher than domestic fees and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be modified for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements revenues from processing crossborder transactions fluctuate with crossborder activities see “risk factorsbusiness risks a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions” in part i item 1a 

in 2011 net revenues from our five largest customers accounted for approximately 17 billion or 26 of our total revenue no single customer generated greater than 10 of total revenue 

see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  revenues” in part ii item 7 for more detail 

gdv and processed transactions 

the tables below provide information regarding two key drivers of our revenue 1 gdv which forms the basis of volumebased revenues and 2 processed transactions 

gdv  the gdv table below provides information regarding the gdv for all mastercardbranded cards excluding cirrus and maestro and for both mastercard credit and charge programs and mastercard debit and prepaid programs in the united states and in all of our other regions for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 growth rates are provided on both a us dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated gdv represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with mastercardbranded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks 



 note that figures in the above table may not sum due to rounding 

1  gdv generated by maestro and cirrus cards is not included the data for gdv is provided by mastercard customers and includes information with respect to mastercardbranded transactions that are not processed by mastercard and for which mastercard does not earn significant revenues all data is subject to revision and amendment by mastercards customers subsequent to the date of its release which revisions and amendments may be material 

2  local currency growth eliminates the impact of currency fluctuations and represents local market performance 

processed transactions  the table below sets forth the total number of transactions processed by mastercard for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 



participation standards   

we establish and enforce our standards surrounding participation in mastercard and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and application of standards 

participation in the mastercard payments network is generally open to financial institutions and other entities that are our customers applicants for participation must meet specified requirements in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants that meet those specified criteria licenses provide customers with certain rights including access to the network and usage of our brands antimoney laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new customers prior to issuing a license and existing customers are evaluated applying a riskbased approach all customers must meet the requirements of mastercards antimoney laundering program and mastercard can suspend and ultimately terminate participation for noncompliance with the program as a condition of our licenses customers agree to comply with our standards which include requirements set forth within our certificate of incorporation bylaws policies rules and operating regulations and procedures mastercard and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and apply our standards which relate to topics such as participation eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement and customer failures 

customer risk management 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of mastercard maestro and cirrus and affiliate debit licensees our gross settlement risk exposure for mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded transactions which is primarily estimated using the average daily card volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 391 billion  as of december 31 2011 principal customers participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers 

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor the financial health of economic and political operating environments of and compliance with our standards by our principal customers affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses if the financial condition of a customer or the state of the economy or political environment in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or to other mastercard customers or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the customer to make operational changes andor post collateral this collateral is typically in the form of a standby letter of credit a bank guarantee or a secured cash account and is required to mitigate our exposure as of december 31 2011 we had customers who had posted approximately 35 billion  in collateral held for settlement exposure for mastercardbranded transactions if a customer becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other customers we are able to draw upon such customers collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to our customers or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from customers in situations where a customer is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other customers we can suspend and ultimately terminate participation in our network additionally and to further preserve payment system integrity mastercard reserves the right to terminate a customers right to participate in our network if for example the customer fails or refuses to make payments in the ordinary course of business or if a liquidating agent conservator or receiver is appointed for the customer in addition to these measures we have also established a 275 billion committed credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of customer settlement failure see “risk factorsbusiness risksas a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of principal customers and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity” in part i item 1a of this report see also “risk factorsbusiness risksunprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business” in part i item 1a of this report    

payment system integrity     

  

the integrity of our payment system can be affected by fraudulent activity and illegal uses of our products and our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information often resulting from security breaches of thirdparty systems that inappropriately transmit process or store cardholder account data see “risk factorsbusiness risksaccount data breaches involving card data stored processed or transmitted by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in part i item 1a of this report fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as ecommerce mobile commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and 

cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt or the presence of the card or merchant agent is unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to help ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents key compliance programs include merchant audits for high fraud excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions and security compliance including our mastercard site data protection service® which assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises by requiring proper adherence to the payment card industry data security standards pci dss our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate 

our customers generally are responsible for fraud losses associated with the products they issue and the merchants from which they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of mastercard products we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help prevent fraud including mastercard securecode® a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique personal code and our site data protection program to advance adherence to the pci dss we also provide fraud detection and prevention solutions including our suite of fraud management products and services expert monitoring system and datacash fraud prevention tools for ecommerce merchants   

enterprise risk management   

mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this report managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability we have an enterprise risk management “erm” program which is integrated with the business and designed to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of endtoend risk the erm program leverages our business processes to among other things ensure allocation of resources to appropriately address risk establishment of clear accountability for risk management and provision of transparency of risks to senior management the board of directors and appropriate board committees our erm program seeks to accomplish these goals by identifying prioritizing and monitoring key risks providing an independent view of our risk profile and strengthening business operations by integrating erm principles and continuing to create a risk aware culture within mastercard mastercards integrated risk management structure balances risk and return by having business units and central functions such as finance and law identify own and manage risks our executive officers set policy and accountability and our board of directors and committees provide oversight of the process 

intellectual property     

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard® maestro® and cirrus® through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used andor properly maintained through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards contactless mobile electronic commerce security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations patents are of varying duration depending on the jurisdiction and filing date and will typically expire at the end of their natural term 

competition      

general  mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased payment systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards contactless mobile and webbased payments and other electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments as a result of a global trend electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment and card brands such as mastercard visa american express and discover are benefiting from this displacement however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume 

payment card processing and alternative competitors    

 17 

express and discover among others within the global general purpose card industry visa has significantly greater volume than we do outside of the united states some of our competitors such as jcb in japan and unionpay in china have leading positions in their domestic markets regulation can also play a role in determining competitive market advantages for competitors for example unionpay is the sole domestic processor designated by the chinese government and operates the sole national crossbank bankcard information switch network in china as a result of local regulation some governments such as india and russia are promoting local networks for domestic processing and there are similar developments in other countries see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks   government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues” in part i item 1a of this report        

 

 

 

   

 

 18 

prepaid card can be processed only by one network or only by a group of affiliated networks the wall street reform and consumer protection act also prohibits any restrictions on a merchants ability to route a transaction over any one of the networks that is enabled on a debit card or prepaid card    these events have resulted in challenges as well as potential opportunities to compete for business in this area 

 

 

financial institution customers  

 

 

competitive position  we believe that the principal factors influencing our competitive position in the global payments industry are 

 

• the ability to participate in new payment forms 

• customer relationships 

• the impact of existing and future litigation legislation and government regulation 

• the impact of globalization and consolidation of financial institutions and merchants 

• the acceptance base reputation and brand recognition of payment cards 

• pricing 

• the success and scope of marketing and promotional campaigns 

• the quality security and integrity of transaction processing 

• the relative value of services and products offered and 

• the impact of new market entrants 

government regulation       

general government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years including in the united states regulators in several countries outside of the united states have also become increasingly interested in payment issues a number of which have launched official proceedings related to payment industry issues see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

interchange fees   interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions such challenges include regulatory proceedings in the european union by the european commission as well as by individual european union member states and elsewhere interchange fees have also become the subject of legislative action in particular regulations implemented in october 2011 by the federal reserve in accordance with the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “wall street reform and consumer protection act” set limits on debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” see “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks  interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” and “the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse effect on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in part i item 1a and in note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

nosurcharge rules   we have historically implemented policies in certain regions that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using mastercard instead of other means several jurisdictions have indicated interest in either ending or limiting the application of these nosurcharge rules in particular the reserve bank of australia the rba had enacted regulations prohibiting the networks from enforcing nosurcharge rules in december 2011 the rba indicated that it would consider allowing certain limitations to a merchants ability to surcharge our nosurcharge rules in canada have also been challenged by the canadian competition bureau 

data protection and information security  aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commissions information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue our customers in the united states are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers 

in the united states during the past several years a number of bills have been considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address consumer privacy passive collection of information such as use of “cookies” and other technology information safeguarding and data breach issues congress continues to consider these issues which could result in legislation that may have an adverse impact on us and our customers a large number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach in europe the european parliament and council is in the process of revising the european directive 9546ec the “directive” which provides for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data the revised regulation as well as the directive obligates the controller of an individuals personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data both the current directive and the proposed regulation establish general principles with regard to the 

processing of personal data including the legal grounds for processing the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the european economic area and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data in addition to the united states and europe many jurisdictions around the world are enacting similar privacy data protection and information security regulations which have similar impacts to our businesses in these jurisdictions see “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks  regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use and or security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs” in part i item 1a of this report 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352 of the usa patriot act section 352 of the usa patriot act requires mastercard to maintain a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and imposes similar requirements on our financial institution customers in the united states our antimoney laundering program must be reasonably designed to prevent our system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities the program must include the designation of a compliance officer provide for the training of appropriate personnel regarding antimoney laundering responsibilities as well as incorporate policies procedures and controls to mitigate money laundering risks and be independently audited 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by the us office of foreign assets control “ofac” restricting financial transactions with cuba burmamyanmar iran syria and sudan and with persons and entities included in ofacs list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” cuba iran sudan and syria also have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states mastercard takes measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with ofac sanctions however it is possible that such transactions may be processed through our payment system it is possible that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock 

financial industry regulation  mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” under its authority to examine financial institutions technology service providers examinations by the ffiec cover areas such as data integrity and data security in recent years the us federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures affecting credit card payment terms and requiring more conservative accounting greater risk management and in some cases higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders in addition mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk 

in july 2010 as part of the wall street reform and consumer protection act the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” was created the cfpb has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products although it is not clear whether andor to what extent the cfpb will be authorized to regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations in addition the wall street reform and consumer protection act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” in order to identify risks to the financial stability of the united states that could arise from the material financial distress or failure of or ongoing activities by large interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies among other responsibilities fsoc is tasked with identifying payment clearing and settlement systems that are “systemically important” under the applicable statutory standard under the wall street reform and consumer protection act such systems will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements it is not clear whether mastercard would be deemed “systemically important” however the imposition of any additional regulatory or other obligations on mastercard could result in costly new compliance burdens that could negatively impact our business see “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks  the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in part i item 1a of this report 

governmentimposed market participation regulations  regulators in several countries such as australia mexico colombia india singapore russia and indonesia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in these countries such regulations include or could include providing broad regulatory oversight over retail payment system operators to the central banks in such countries in addition governments in some countries may act to provide resources or preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payment card and processing providers which could displace us from or prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies 

issuer practice regulation the federal reserve has also adopted regulations addressing overdraft fees imposed in connection with atm and debit card transactions these regulations may limit the ability of our customers to charge overdraft fees in connection 

with debit card programs this may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our customers and may adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues 

regulation of internet transactions  in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is implemented through a federal regulation compliance was required no later than june 1 2010 although congress may consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate internet gambling the federal regulation required us and our customers to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs andor could decrease our transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes 

additional regulatory developments   various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly these new requirements and developments may affect our customers ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as prepaid cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth

 item 1a   risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations 

interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant financial institution the acquirer to the cardholder financial institution the issuer in connection with transactions initiated on our payment system we do not earn revenues from interchange fees they are however a key factor in balancing the costs consumers pay and the costs merchants pay in our payment system they are also a factor on which we compete with other payment providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process over our network although we have historically set default interchange fees in the united states and other countries in certain jurisdictions our interchange rates and related practices including our default interchange fees are subject to increased litigation and government regulation as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries as well as merchants are seeking to reduce these fees through litigation regulatory action andor legislative action 

increased legislative scrutiny in the united states has resulted in limitations on the rates we are able to establish for default interchange rates for debit and prepaid transactions in july 2010 the united states enacted into law the wall street reform and consumer protection act that among other things requires debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” to be “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction” in october 2011 the us federal reserve board implemented regulations in accordance with the wall street reform and consumer protection act limiting interchange fees for debit and prepaid transactions fee see “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks  the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in this part i item 1a for more detail interchange fees also have been the subject of legislative activity elsewhere including 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions around the world have commenced proceedings or inquiries into interchange fees and related practices examples include 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a detailed description of regulatory proceedings and inquiries into interchange fees we believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions see “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks  new regulations or other legislative or regulatory activity in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products” in this part i item 1a 

additionally merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees through litigation in the united states merchants have filed approximately 50 class action or individual suits alleging that mastercards interchange fees and acceptance rules violate federal antitrust laws these suits allege among other things that our purported setting of interchange fees constitutes horizontal pricefixing between and among mastercard and its customer banks and mastercard visa and their customer banks in violation of section 1 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade the suits seek treble damages attorneys fees and injunctive relief in addition in canada three class action suits have been filed against mastercard visa and a number of large canadian banks relating to mastercard and visa rules related to interchange fees including “honor all cards” and “no surcharge” rules see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees issuers may be unable to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payment system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers also could charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable to consumers and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card and other payment programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge this could also result in less innovation and fewer product offerings we are devoting 

substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have a more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to its competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees any such legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

  

the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations 

the wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in the united states includes provisions that provide for the regulation by the federal reserve of debit and prepaid interchange fees and certain other network industry practices among other things it requires debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” referred to in the wall street reform and consumer protection act as fees established charged or received by a payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in an electronic debit transaction to be “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction” additionally it provides that neither an issuer nor a payment card network may establish exclusive network arrangements for debit or prepaid cards or inhibit the ability of a merchant to choose among different networks for routing debit or prepaid transactions 

as of october 1 2011 federal reserve regulations went into effect implementing these provisions in accordance with the wall street reform and consumer protection act with certain exceptions for issuer compliance with the exclusivity requirements the regulations limit pertransaction us debit and prepaid interchange fees to 21 cents plus five basis points the issuer may receive interim fraud prevention adjustment of an additional one cent if it meets certain requirements the interchange limitations are a significant reduction from average interchange fees in effect before the regulations were implemented the regulations contain exemptions from the interchange limitations for issuers that together with their affiliates have less than 10 billion in assets as well as for debit cards issued pursuant to a governmentadministered payment program and certain reloadable prepaid cards also while the regulations do not directly regulate network fees they make clear that network fees cannot be used to circumvent the interchange fee restrictions see “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks  interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in this part i item 1a with respect to network arrangements and transaction routing the regulations require debit and prepaid cards to be enabled with two unaffiliated payment card networks the regulations also provide that an issuer or payment card network may not inhibit the ability of any person that accepts or honors a debit or prepaid card to direct the routing of the card transaction for processing over any network enabled on the card 

the wall street reform and consumer protection act also created two new independent regulatory bodies in  the cfpb and fsoc the cfpb has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products although it is not clear whether andor to what extent the cfpb will be authorized to regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations the fsoc is tasked among other responsibilities with identifying “systemically important” payment clearing and settlement systems that will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements although it is not clear whether mastercard would be deemed “systemically important” under the applicable standard if mastercard were deemed “systemically important” it would be subject to new risk management regulations relating to its payment clearing and settlement activities new regulations could address areas such as risk management policies and procedures collateral requirements participant default policies and procedures the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transactions and capital and financial resource requirements also a “systemically important” payment system could be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve or another federal agency for changes to its system rules procedures or operations that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payment system these developments or actions could increase the cost of operating our business and may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers as well as consumers this could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues 

if issuers acquirers andor merchants modify their business operations or otherwise take actions in response to this legislation which have the result of reducing the number of debit or prepaid transactions we process or the network fees we collect the wall street reform and consumer protection act could have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations failure by our customers or us to adjust our strategies successfully to compete in the new environment would increase this impact 

new regulations or other legislative or regulatory activity in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each others approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries 

consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions this includes the wall street reform and consumer protection act and federal reserve regulations implemented under the act as well as other regulatory and legislative activity relating to interchange similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations like those affecting debit payments could lead to regulations affecting credit and general use prepaid cards see “risk factors  legal and regulatory risks  government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues” in this part i item 1a 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product these include matters like interchange rates network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business with the same effect either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues         

governments in some countries such as russia ukraine and india could act to provide resources or preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment card and processing providers these governments may take this action to support these providers they may also take this action to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies as an example governments in some countries are considering or may consider and in the case of venezuela have ordered regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies such a development would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for customers our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volumes and revenues   

we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently mastercard is at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “businessgovernment regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation in addition to the wall street reform and consumer protection act examples include 

 

 

 26 

credit card issuers additional regulations include regulations by the board of governors regulating overdraft fees imposed in connection with atm and debit card transactions 

 

increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which could reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs   

we and our customers are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we and our customers could be negatively impacted by these regulations recently these topics have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states at both the federal and state level in europe as well as in other jurisdictions around the world in 2011 additional privacy and data protection laws and regulations were enacted in several countries including india mexico colombia and venezuela regulation of privacy and data protection and information security in these and other jurisdictions may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment cards which may in turn decrease the number of our cards that they issue any additional regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations which could materially and adversely affect our profitability finally failure to comply with the privacy and data protection and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

    

determinations which we could make in the future to establish reserves or liabilities we may incur for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition     

as discussed in note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report w e recorded a 770 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 which represents our estimate for the financial portion of a settlement of the us merchant litigation cases except as otherwise discussed in note 20 we have not established reserves for any other of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future we may determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any of our other legal proceedings is required including charges related to legal fees in addition we may be required to record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of reserves that we have previously recorded such charges particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

  

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

certain limitations have been placed on our business in recent years because of litigation for example as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit in 2003 merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa moreover in the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a pretax charge in the us merchant litigation cases based on progress in the mediation process the plaintiffs in these cases are also seeking changes to our business practices see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

potential changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

potential changes in existing tax laws such as recent proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states including the treatment of earnings of controlled foreign corporations may impact our effective tax rate see also note 19 income tax to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

business risks 

our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry   

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments within the global general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa american express discover unionpay and jcb among others visa has greater volume than we do and has greater scale and market share as well as strong brand recognition which may provide significant competitive advantages moreover some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcomes of litigation regulatory proceedings and legislative activity 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate endtoend payment systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without involving intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of endtoend payment systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of four party payment systems such as ours in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition these competitors have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of fourparty payment systems such as ours certain competitors may also hold competitive advantages as a result of their organizational structures see “businesscompetition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth our customers can also develop their own competitive services as a result our revenue or profitability could decline we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems ecommerce payment systems and payment systems for mobile devices a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we also expect that there may be other changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 

 

 

 

our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our business revenue and profitability 

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers resulting in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor significant consolidation in the banking industry may result in the substantial loss of business for mastercard which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which mastercard has a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term if we lose a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest significant customers which could have a material adverse longterm impact on our business    

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2011 the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 17 billion or 26 of total revenue loss of business from 

any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

merchants continue to be focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability   

we rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants are supporting many of the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risksinterchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” also see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risksthe wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives 

certain customers have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and may have a material adverse impact on our business 

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from mastercard to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payment system among regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

  

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the marketplaces perception of our brands and reputation 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to our branded products depends highly upon the external perception of our company and industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny we have also been pursuing the use of social media channels at an increasingly rapid pace under some circumstances such use could also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our business 

if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth 

in recent years on an industrywide basis signaturebased and pinbased debit transactions have grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions however in the united states transactions involving our brands account for a smaller share of all signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low penetration in the united states we may not be able to increase our penetration for debit transactions in the united states since many of our competitors have longstanding and strong positions although this could be impacted by the federal reserves implementation of network exclusivity rules under the wall street reform and consumer protection act we may also be impacted adversely by the tendency among us consumers and merchants to migrate from signaturebased debit transactions to pinbased transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions and as noted above pinbased transactions are more likely to be processed by other atmdebit pointofsale networks than by us any of these factors may inhibit the growth of our debit business which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and overall prospects for future growth 

unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil more recently several european countries have experienced downgrades in sovereign credit ratings by rating agencies driven by fiscal challenges in addition some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercards financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis and the state of economic environments the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue may be negatively impacted or we may be impacted in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 31 

experiencing relatively high unemployment may cause decreased spending by cardholders 

 

any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and transaction processing fees revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with crossborder travel and our customers need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu viruses and other diseases any such decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

general economic and global political conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our revenue and profitability 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands also as we are principally based in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business prospects and growth 

as a guarantor of certain thirdparty obligations including those of principal customers and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity     

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons if a principal customer or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations our mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded gross legal settlement exposure which is primarily estimated using the average daily volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to 

settle was approximately 391 billion  as of december 31 2011 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 275 billion which could be used for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in the event that mastercard effects a payment on behalf of a failed customer mastercard may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables from its other customers subject to approval by our board of directors customers may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during these ordinary course activities of mastercard while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by our largest customer on its peak day the term and amount of our guarantee of obligations to principal customers is unlimited as a result concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several of our smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition moreover during 2011 many of our financial institution customers continued to be directly and adversely impacted by the unprecedented events in the financial markets which began during 2008 and the economic turmoil that has ensued the european financial crisis remains a heightened concern our aggregate gross settlement exposures to italy spain greece and portugal four of the countries most significantly impacted by the eurozone crisis are less than 5 of our total gross settlement exposure and are being managed through various planning and mitigation practices nonetheless these conditions present increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees 

separately mastercard also provides guarantees to customers and certain other companies indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures of third parties to perform for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practices as of december 31 2011 see note 21 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

if our transaction processing systems and other services are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions or service our customers efficiently or at all our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced    

our transaction processing systems and other services may experience service interruptions as a result of process or other technology malfunction fire natural or manmade disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism accident or other catastrophic events a disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services our visibility in the global payments industry may also attract terrorists activists or hackers to attack our facilities or systems we routinely receive cyberthreats of varying levels any actual attacks could lead to service interruptions increased costs or data security compromises if such attacks are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded we maintain an information security program a business continuity program and insurance coverage and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks despite these mitigation efforts however we cannot ensure that the security infrastructure of our processing systems would be immune to these risks 

additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or other cybersecurity incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services because of the intrinsic importance of our processing systems to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability 

account data breaches involving card data stored processed or transmitted by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue   

we our customers merchants and other third parties process transmit or store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards in addition our customers may sponsor thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage the reputation of our brands and lead to claims against us in recent years there have been several highprofile account data compromise events involving merchants and thirdparty payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affected millions of mastercard visa discover american express and other types of cardholders these events typically involve external agents hacking and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of servers as a result of such data security breaches we may be subject to lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands while most of these lawsuits do not involve direct claims against us we could be exposed to damage claims in various circumstances which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our profitability any damage to our reputation or that of 

our brands resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes revenue and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards   

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards or misconduct by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance adoption of new technologies or enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation and financial damage which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which could reduce our revenue and income or limit our future growth 

the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes by the complexity of our systems or by intellectual property rights of third parties we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies suggesting that we may be infringing a preexisting patent or that we need to license use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards    

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our operations outside of the united states    

during 2011 approximately 604 of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we do not adequately manage the changes necessary to implement our strategy and effectively deliver our products and solutions our results of operations may suffer 

mastercard continues to experience a significant amount of changes associated with items related to our strategy including changes in technology the marketplace our customers and our products in particular our recent expansion into new businesses could result in unanticipated or unfamiliar issues which may be difficult to manage in addition to these changes we also need to continue to be effective in delivering our existing products and services and in effectively managing related risks if not adequately managed both these changes related to our strategy and our continued delivery of products and solutions could result in missed opportunities for the business or could impact the effectiveness of our organizations execution of its strategy as we manage our strategy and any related changes any difficulty in retaining or attracting key management and employees could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets necessary for the organizations effective execution of its strategy 

acquisitions strategic investments or entry into new businesses could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition or reputation 

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies in addition the integration of any acquisition or investment including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity may divert managements time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on acquisitions or projects that do not meet our expectations or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition any of these acquisitions could also result in control issues which could negatively affect our reputation although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions 

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure   

future sales of our shares of class a common stock could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future as of february 9 2012 we had 121335751  outstanding shares of class a common stock of which 12819395  shares were owned by the mastercard foundation the “foundation” under the terms of the donation of these shares by mastercard to the foundation the foundation became able to sell its shares of our class a common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo in may 2006 to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements under canadian tax law the foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 35 of its assets not used in administration of the foundation in qualified charitable disbursements despite permission from the canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to 15 years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the 15year period the foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year   

  

the market price of our common stock could be volatile 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations and have experienced increased volatility in connection with recent unpredictable economic events around the world this market volatility as well as the factors listed below among others could affect the market price of our common stock 















  

there are terms in our charter documents and under delaware law that could be considered antitakeover provisions or could have an impact on a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or 

prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further except in limited circumstances no customer or former customer of mastercard or any operator customer or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

  



a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

as of february 9 2012 the foundation owns 12819395  shares of class a common stock representing approximately 106 of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to the date which is twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our holders of class a common stock and class b common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

mastercard intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely the payment of dividends is dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs if as a consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make or may have to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock

overview 

mastercard is a global payments and technology company that connects billions of consumers thousands of financial institutions millions of merchants governments and businesses worldwide enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks we envision an environment where electronic payment is the predominant means of payment we use our technology and expertise to make payments more convenient secure and efficient to enable consumers to meet their needs and to provide value to all stakeholders in the payments system 

we offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable our customers and partners to develop and implement credit debit prepaid and related payment programs and solutions to deliver value to consumers our customers and partners include financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers” merchants government entities telecommunications companies and other businesses we manage a family of wellknown widelyaccepted payment brands including mastercard maestro and cirrus which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs and solutions we process payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network and provide support services to our customers and other partners as part of managing our brands we establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network 

we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands as cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards and other devices that carry our brands 

we analyze our ability to grow based on three drivers 

 we support our focus on these drivers by continuing to 

 see “business environment” for a discussion of considerations related to our longterm strategic objectives 

we recorded net income of 19 billion  or 1485  per diluted share in 2011 versus net income of 18 billion  or 1405  per diluted share in 2010 and net income of 15 billion or 1116 per diluted share in 2009 in addition we generated cash flows from operations of 27 billion  for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 17 billion  and 14 billion for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively our 2011 financial results were significantly impacted by the mdl provision of 770 million see income taxes for a table which provides a reconciliation showing the 495 million aftertax impact to the net income attributable to mastercard 

our net revenues increased 212  in 2011 primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions recent acquisitions also contributed approximately 3 percentage points to revenue growth in 2011 the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of revenues from our functional currencies to us dollars had a favorable impact on net revenues of approximately 2  percentage points in 2011 our net revenues increased 86  in 2010 primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands pricing changes and increased transactions the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of revenues from our functional currencies to us dollars reduced net revenue growth by approximately 1  percentage point in 2010 

our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending changes in cardholder spending behavior influenced by economic conditions impact our ability to grow our revenues our revenues are primarily impacted by the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands and the number of transactions in 2011 volumebased revenues domestic assessments and crossborder volume fees and transactionbased revenues transaction processing fees increased compared to 2010 in 2011 our processed transactions increased 183  and our volumes increased 161  on a local currency basis this compares to increased processed transactions of 29  and increased volumes of 91  on a local currency basis in 2010 the net effects of pricing actions contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our net revenue growth in 2011 during 2010 net pricing actions contributed approximately 5 percentage points to our net revenue growth these net pricing actions included the effects of price increases during 2009 and 2010 which were partially offset by an increase in related crossborder rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the european commission overall net revenue growth for 2011 and 2010 was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 249  267  and 241  in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

our operating expenses increased 436  in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the mdl provision and greater general and administrative expenses including higher personnel expenses to support the companys strategic initiatives and personnel expenses related to recent acquisitions excluding the impact of the mdl provision specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in operating expenses operating expenses increased 160  in 2011 compared to 2010 the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of expenses from our functional currencies to us dollars increased expenses by approximately 2  percentage points in 2011 

our operating expenses decreased 18  in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses the decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower personnel expenses partially offset by increased professional fees the net foreign currency impact 

of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and the brazilian real reduced expenses by approximately 1  percentage point in 2010 

our ratios of operating income as a percentage of net revenues or operating margins were 404  497  and 443  in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively excluding the impact of the mdl provision in 2011 our operating margin was 519 the effective income tax rates were 306  330  and 341  in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

on april 15 2011 mastercard acquired the prepaid card program management operations of travelex holdings ltd since renamed access prepaid worldwide “access” at a purchase price of 295 million uk pound sterling or 481 million including adjustments for working capital with contingent consideration an “earnout” of up to an additional 35 million uk pound sterling or approximately 57 million if certain performance targets were met see note 2 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report through access mastercard manages and delivers consumer and corporate prepaid travel cards through business partners around the world including financial institutions retailers travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus access enables us to offer endtoend prepaid card solutions encompassing branded switching issuer processing and program management services primarily focused on the travel sector and in markets outside the united states

business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies net revenue generated in the united states was 396  416  and 424  of total net revenue in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period but differences in market growth economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil more recently countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies including several in europe as well as the united states in addition some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies the condition of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance as a result our revenue may be negatively impacted or the company may be impacted in several ways for a full discussion see risk factors  business risks  unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business in part i item 1a of this report 

in addition our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and part i item 1a risk factors of this report for further discussion 

mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry for example in our asia 

pacific and latin american regions we have now experienced several quarters of significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the united states and europe we have recently experienced significant growth in dollar volume despite mixed economic indicators notwithstanding recent encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business 

financial results 

our operating results for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows 

  



   not meaningful 

1  the data for gdv is provided by mastercard customers and includes information with respect to mastercardbranded transactions that are not processed by mastercard and for which mastercard does not earn significant revenues gdv may be revised by mastercards customers after its original submission and these revisions may be material gdv generated by maestro and cirrus cards is not included 

2   represents total number of transactions processed by mastercard and growth from the comparable periods 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar for 2011 as compared to 2010 the us dollar weakened against both the euro and the brazilian real accordingly the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real increased net revenues and expenses by approximately 2  percentage points in 2011 for 2010 as compared to 2009 the us dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and weakened against the brazilian 

real which decreased revenues and expenses by approximately 1 percentage point 

in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume “gdv” and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis in 2011 gdv on a us converted basis increased 193  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 161  in 2010 gdv on a us converted basis increased 107  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 91  the company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities which are discussed further in note 22 foreign exchange risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

revenues 

revenue descriptions 

mastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders merchants issuers the cardholders’ financial institutions and acquirers the merchants’ financial institutions our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other paymentrelated services we provide to our customers our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro and brazilian real 

we process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system providing cardholders with the ability to utilize and merchants to accept mastercard cards across multiple country borders we process most of the crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states united kingdom canada brazil and a select number of other smaller countries 

our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers a combination of the following factors determines the pricing 

 in general crossborder transactions generate higher revenue than domestic transactions since crossborder fees are higher than domestic fees and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion 

we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be modified for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 

the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories

border card usage and other general marketing purposes

 revenue analysis 

in 2011 and 2010 gross revenues increased 14  billion and 841  million or 182  and 125  respectively revenue growth in 2011 was primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions revenue growth in 2010 was primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on our cards carrying our brands higher pricing and increased transactions rebates and incentives in 2011 and 2010 increased 202  and 401  million or 100  and 248  versus 2010 and 2009 respectively our net revenues in 2011 and 2010 increased 212  and 86  versus 2010 and 2009 respectively 

our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands in 2011 our processed transactions increased 183  and our volumes increased 161  on a local currency basis in 2010 our processed transactions increased 29  and our volumes increased 91  on a local currency basis recent acquisitions contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our net revenue growth in 2011 the effects of pricing actions implemented in 2011 and 2010 contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our net revenue growth for 2011 the pricing structure for our acquirer revenues from crossborder transactions was simplified in the fourth quarter of 2010 pursuant to the previous structure mastercard charged a crossborder volume fee but provided a rebate if mastercard was allowed to perform the currency conversion beginning in october 2010 if mastercard performs the currency conversion the crossborder volume fee charged is lower and no rebate is provided this change had no impact on net revenues 

in 2010 pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 5 percentage points these net pricing changes primarily 

related to increases in crossborder volume fees domestic assessments and transaction processing fees partially offset by approximately 3 percentage points attributable to increased crossborder rebates the net pricing change also included an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the october 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of june 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the european commission see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2011 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 17 billion or 26 of total net revenues the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income see “risk factors  business risks  additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers resulting in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors  business risks  we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report 

the significant components of our net revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows 



domestic assessments –  there was an increase in domestic assessments of 229  and 109  during 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily due to the following 

 crossborder volume fees –  there was an increase in crossborder volume fees of 87  and 277  during 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily due to the following 

 transaction processing fees –  there was an increase in transaction processing fees of 181  and 76  during 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily due to the following 

 other revenues –  other revenues increased 264  and 10  during 2011 and 2010 respectively primarily due to the following 

 48 

 rebates and incentives –  rebates and incentives increased 100  and 248  during 2011 and 2010 respectively rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 249  267  and 241  in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the amount of rebates and incentives increased primarily due to the following 

 operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing depreciation and amortization expenses and in 2011 the mdl provision operating expenses increased 12 billion  or 436  in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the 770 million mdl provision and higher general and administrative expenses including expenses related to recent acquisitions excluding the impact of the mdl provision operating expenses increased 445 million or 160 in 2011 compared to 2010 the recent acquisitions contributed approximately 6 percentage points to the increase in operating expenses in 2011 in 2010 operating expenses decreased 52 million or 18 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses 

the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses excluding the mdl provision which is a nongaap financial measure to the operating expenses including the mdl provision which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement management believes this analysis facilitates understanding of our ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods 



 not meaningful 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 339 million  or 183  in 2011 compared to 2010 which included the increases related to recent acquisitions primarily in personnel and other expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 85 million  or 44  in 2010 compared to 2009 the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of general and administrative expenses from our functional currencies to us dollars increased general and administrative expenses by approximately 1  percentage point in 2011 and reduced general and administrative expenses by approximately 1  percentage point in 2010 

the major components of general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows 



 

 

 

 

advertising and marketing 

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness preference and usage through integrated advertising sponsorship promotional interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences advertising and marketing expenses increased 59 million  or 76  in 2011 mainly due to sponsorships and promotional initiatives in 2010 advertising and marketing expenses increased 26 million  or 35  mainly due to customerspecific initiatives and sponsorships the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of advertising and marketing expenses from our functional currencies to us dollars increased advertising 

and marketing expenses by approximately 2  percentage points in 2011 and reduced advertising and marketing expense by 1  percentage point in 2010 

provision for litigation settlement 

as of december 31 2011 the company accrued 770 million  related to the mdl provision the amount represents an estimate of the companys financial liability that could result from a settlement based on progress in the mediation process there were no comparable charges in 2010 see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 46 million  or 311  in 2011 versus 2010 the increases in depreciation and amortization expense reflected the amortization of intangible assets from recent acquisitions and increased investments in data center equipment for our global payments network 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense our share of income losses from equity method investments and other gains and losses the increase of total other income in 2011 versus 2010 of 28 million  was primarily due to a decrease in the interest accretion on litigation settlements and an adjustment to the earnout related to the companys recent acquisition of access see note 2 acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report partially offset by expenses from equity method investments the increase of total other income in 2010 versus 2009 of 47 million  was primarily due to a decrease in interest expenses of 63 million  resulting from a reduction in interest on litigation settlements and on uncertain tax positions 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were 306  330  and 341  respectively the tax rate for 2011 was lower than the tax rate for 2010 primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings including the tax benefit related to the mdl provision and the recognition of discrete adjustments in 2011 and 2010 the tax rate for 2010 was lower than the tax rate in 2009 primarily due to the 2010 impact of actual and anticipated repatriations from foreign subsidiaries partially offset by discrete adjustments in 2010 and 2009 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35  to pretax income for the years ended december 31  as a result of the following 



the companys gaap effective tax rate for 2011 was affected by the tax benefits related to the mdl provision due to the nonrecurring nature of this item the company believes that the calculation of the 2011 effective tax rate excluding the impact of the mdl provision facilitates meaningful comparison of effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 



during 2011 the companys unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by 49 million the increase in the companys unrecognized tax benefits for 2011 is primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions as of december 31 2011 the companys unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were 214 million  all of which would reduce the companys effective tax rate if recognized 

in 2010 in connection with the expansion of the companys operations in the asia pacific middle east and africa region the companys subsidiary in singapore mastercard asia pacific pte ltd “mappl” received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance at the recommendation of the singapore economic development board see note 19 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures to make continued investments in our business and to service our potential litigation obligations at december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  we had 49 billion  and 39 billion  respectively of cash and cash equivalents and current availableforsale securities to use for our operations 

in september 2010 the company’s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to 1 billion of its class a common stock in open market transactions the company did not repurchase any shares under this plan during 2010 in april 2011 the company’s board of directors amended the existing share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase an incremental 1 billion of its class a common stock in open market transactions the incremental 1 billion share repurchase authorization increases the class a share repurchase program to an aggregate of 2 billion during the year ended december 31 2011  mastercard repurchased a total of approximately 44 million shares for 11 billion  at an average price of 25892  per share of class a common stock these repurchased shares are considered treasury stock 

as of january 27 2012 the cumulative repurchases by the company under the share repurchase program totaled approximately 47 million  shares of its class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately 13 billion  at an average price of 26465  per share of class a common stock the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including legal requirements price and economic and market conditions 

the company believes that its existing cash balances its cash flow generating capabilities its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs capital asset purchases outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential litigation obligations cash and cash equivalents and current availableforsale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to us tax upon repatriation was 18 billion and 11 billion at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively or 37 and 28 of our total cash and cash equivalents and current availableforsale investment securities as of such dates it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2011 outside of the united states as disclosed in note 19 income tax to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings if these earnings are needed for us operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states the company would be subject to us tax upon repatriation 

our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions and the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a note 18 obligations under litigation settlements and note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and “business environment ” in part ii item 7 of this report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business additionally our liquidity could be affected by the failure of customers to meet their settlement obligations see note 21 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for further discussion

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2011  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances 



  

 

seasonality 

our fourth quarter results typically include higher customer and merchant incentives which are recorded as contrarevenue due to higher contract renewal activity and increased purchase volume and promotional activity related to the holiday shopping period generally reducing our net revenue the fourth quarter also generally includes increased advertising and marketing expenses primarily due to promotional activity related to the holiday shopping period and the timing of advertising and promotional campaigns 

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

  







recent accounting pronouncements 

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in september 2009 the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended current accounting standards require companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors the new accounting standard eliminates i the residual method of revenue allocation and ii the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered the company adopted the revised accounting standard effective january 1 2011 via prospective adoption the adoption did not have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations 

fair value measurement and disclosure  the company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company classifies these recurring fair value measurements into a threelevel hierarchy valuation hierarchy and discloses the significant assumptions utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value in january 2010 fair value disclosure requirements were amended to require detailed disclosures about transfers to and from level 1 and 2 of the valuation hierarchy effective january 1 2010 and disclosures regarding purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis within the level 3 of the valuation hierarchy reconciliation effective january 1 2011 the company adopted the new guidance for disclosures about transfers to and from level 1 and 2 of the valuation hierarchy effective january 1 2010 the adoption did not have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations the company adopted the guidance that requires disclosure of a reconciliation of purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy effective january 1 2011 as required and the adoption did not have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations 

in may 2011 the fair value accounting standard was amended to change fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements the key changes in measurement principles include limiting the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise to nonfinancial assets providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement and aligning the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entitys shareholders equity with the guidance for liabilities disclosures will be required for all transfers between levels 1 and 2 within the valuation hierarchy the use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value if its use differs from its highest and best use the level in the valuation hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed and for level 3 measurements quantitative information about unobservable inputs used a description of the valuation processes used and qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements the company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective january 1 2012 via prospective adoption as required and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations 

disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  in july 2010 a new accounting standard was issued that requires companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements including but not limited to significant purchases and sales of financing receivables aging information and credit quality indicators the company adopted this accounting standard effective january 1 2011 and the adoption did not have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations 

impairment testing for goodwill  in december 2010 a new accounting standard was issued that requires step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to be performed for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists the provisions for this pronouncement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 with no early adoption permitted the company adopted this accounting standard on january 1 2011 and the adoption did not have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations

business combinations  in december 2010 a new accounting standard was issued that requires a company to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred 

as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only when comparative financial statements are presented the disclosure provisions are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2010 with early adoption permitted the company adopted this accounting standard on january 1 2011 and the adoption did not have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations 

comprehensive income  in june 2011 a new accounting standard was issued that amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income 1 in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or 2 in two separate but consecutive financial statements consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income also items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements in december 2011 a new accounting standard was issued that indefinitely defers the effective date for the requirement to present the reclassification of items from comprehensive income to net income both standards require retrospective application and are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the company will adopt the revised accounting standards effective january 1 2012 and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the companys financial position or results of operations 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there were no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2011 as compared to december 31 2010 the wall street reform and consumer protection act includes provisions related to derivative financial instruments and the company is determining what impact if any such provisions will have on the companys financial position or results of operations 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies we also enter into forward contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months

1 amounts represent gross fair value amounts while these amounts may be netted for actual balance sheet presentation 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of 17 other transaction currencies the remaining 133 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities which we generally hold as availableforsale investments our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the companys available for sale investments as of december 31 was as follows

 item 1 business 

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payments company that provides a critical economic link among financial institutions businesses merchants cardholders and governments worldwide enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks we provide a variety of services in support of the credit debit prepaid and related payment programs of approximately 22000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers we primarily 

 

  

  

  

  

 mastercard generates revenue by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity or gross dollar volume “gdv” on the cards that carry our brands 

a typical transaction processed over our network involves four parties in addition to us the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholder’s financial institution and the acquirer the merchant’s financial institution consequently the payment network we operate supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system our customers are financial institutions and other entities that act as issuers and acquirers using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient quick and secure payment method that is accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customers to ensure the integrity of our payment network in addition we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands however cardholder and merchant transaction relationships are managed principally by our customers we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the “merchant discount” charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

our business has a global reach and has continued to experience growth in 2010 we processed 231 billion transactions a 29 increase over the number of transactions processed in 2009 gdv on cards carrying the mastercard brand as reported by our customers was approximately 27 trillion in 2010 a 107 increase in us dollar terms and a 91 increase in local currency terms over the gdv reported in 2009 

  

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as payment card transactions creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term our focus is on continuing to 

 

  

  

 we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment in recent years we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny and other legal challenges particularly with respect to interchange fees interchange fees which represent a balancing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers and in turn among merchants and cardholders have been the subject of regulatory review and challenges and legislative action as well as litigation as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers we do not earn revenues from interchange fees however if issuers were unable to collect interchange fees or were to receive reduced interchange fees we may experience a reduction in the number of customers willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system such as ours andor a reduction in the rate of cards issued as well as overall transaction volumes proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment may also become more attractive to issuers issuers might also decide to charge higher fees to cardholders thereby making our card programs less desirable to consumers and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability they also might attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge in addition to those challenges relating to interchange fees we are also exposed to a variety of significant lawsuits and regulatory actions including federal antitrust claims and claims under state unfair competition statutes see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

mastercard incorporated was incorporated as a delaware stock corporation in may 2001 we conduct our business principally through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” a delaware nonstock or membership corporation that was formed in november 1966 our customers are generally either principal members of mastercard international which participate directly in mastercard international’s business or affiliate members of mastercard international which participate indirectly in mastercard international’s business through principal members in may 2006 we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure for mastercard incorporated including an initial public offering of a new class of common stock the “ipo” which included the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors who are independent from our customers for more information about our capital structure voting rights of our class a common stock our voting stock and class b common stock our nonvoting stock and conversions of shares of our class b common stock into shares of our voting class a common stock see note 17 stockholders’ equity to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

our industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

 

  

   

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 

  

  

 generally cardbased forms of payment involve two types of transactions depending on the type of card being used transactions that typically require the cardholder’s signature which are referred to as “offline” transactions and transactions that require the cardholder to use a personal identification number “pin” for verification which are typically referred to as “online” transactions some purchase transactions outside of the united states such as those made using cards equipped with a chip can be pinauthenticated but are considered offline transactions in addition some payment cards are equipped with an rfid radio frequency identification microchip which provides an advanced authentication technique and technology which allows contactless payments requiring neither signature nor pin under established transaction amounts many merchants no longer require a signature for low value purchases and there is no pin or signature on ecommerce or other cardnotpresent transactions such transactions are still considered however to be offline transactions 

the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard visa ®  american express ®  jcb ®  diners club ® and discover ®  historically these brands—including mastercard—were principally associated with credit or charge cards in the united states and other major markets around the world today debit and prepaid cards with mastercard’s brands as well as the brands of visa and others are issued as well 

debit cards may be further categorized into several subsegments 

 

  

  

 regional and domesticlocal pinbased debit brands are the primary brands in many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and other brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions 

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a portion of all cardbased forms of payment typically private label cards are credit cards issued by or on behalf of a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at the issuing merchant’s locations 

  

payment services and solutions 

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services as well as a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design package and implement products and programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers which include cardholders businesses and governments we work with customers to provide customized solutions as well as more general solutions our payment solutions are built upon our expertise in payment programs product development payment processing technology consulting and information services and marketing we also manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through brand advertising promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives 

transaction processing on the mastercard worldwide network 

introduction we operate the mastercard worldwide network our proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards at millions of merchants worldwide we process transactions through our network for financial institutions and other entities that are our customers in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories 

typical transaction  a typical transaction processed over the mastercard worldwide network involves four participants in addition to us cardholder merchant issuer the cardholder’s financial institution and acquirer the merchant’s financial institution the following diagram depicts a typical pointofsale card transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder a purchases goods or services from a merchant b using a card or other payment device after the transaction is authorized by the issuer d using our network the issuer pays the acquirer c an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus the interchange fee described below and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount to the merchant referred to as the “merchant discount” the merchant discount among other things takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee our standards generally guarantee the payment of transactions using mastercardbranded cards and certain transactions using cirrus and maestrobranded cards between issuers and acquirers 

interchange fees the interchange fee is equal to the difference between the amount of the payment transaction the transaction amount and the amount the issuer pays the acquirer the settlement amount interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payment system costs among the customers participating in our fourparty payment card system as such interchange fees are a key factor in balancing the costs consumers pay and the costs merchants pay we do not earn revenues from interchange fees generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers or netted by issuers against amounts paid to acquirers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this 

  

situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers to acquirers we establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process interchange fees can be a significant component of the merchant discount and therefore of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards these fees are currently subject to regulatory legislative andor legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

merchant discount the merchant discount is established by the acquirer to cover its costs and profit margin of participating in the fourparty system the discount takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer and the balance of the discount either consists of fees established by the acquirer and paid by the merchant for certain of the acquirer’s services to the merchant which are retained by the acquirer or reflects the costs of such services 

additional fees and economic considerations acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers transactionbased and related fees for the transaction processing and related services we provide them 

in a fourparty payment system the economics of a payment transaction relative to mastercard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over our network or a thirdparty network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

mastercard worldwide network architecture and operations  we believe the architecture of the mastercard worldwide network is unique featuring a globally integrated structure that provides scalability for our customers and enables them to expand into regional and global markets our network also features an intelligent architecture that enables it to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structures—distributed peertopeer and centralized hubandspoke transactions that require fast reliable processing such as those submitted using a mastercard paypass ® enabled device in a tollway use the network’s distributed processing structure ensuring they are processed close to where the transaction occurred transactions that require valueadded processing such as realtime access to transaction data for fraud scoring or rewards at the pointofsale or customization of transaction data for unique consumerspending controls use the network’s centralized processing structure ensuring advanced processing services are applied to the transaction 

the network typically operates at under 80 capacity and can handle more than 160 million transactions per hour with an average network response time of 130 milliseconds the network can also substantially scale capacity to meet demand our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year our global payment network provides multiple levels of backup protection and related continuity procedures in the event of an outage should the issuer acquirer or payment network experience a service interruption to date we have consistently maintained availability of our global processing systems more than 999 of the time

 acceptance initiatives 

overview we estimate that as of december 31 2010 cards carrying the mastercard brand were accepted at 317 million acceptance locations worldwide including 18 million atms and 06 million other locations where cash may be obtained information on atm and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publiclyavailable reports of payment industry associations government agencies and independent market analysts cards bearing the maestro brand mark are accepted at many of these same locations 

initiatives we seek to maintain unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded programs by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the categories of merchants that accept cards carrying our brands in addition to our focus on expanding acceptance in ecommerce and mobile commerce environments we are also focused on using the functionality of the mastercard worldwide network to expand acceptance in quick service businesses such as fast food restaurants transportation such as commuter train systems buses and taxis and public sector payments such as those involving taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories second we seek to increase the number of payment channels in which mastercard programs are accepted such as by introducing mastercard acceptance in connection with bill payment applications we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make bill payments in a variety of categories—including rent utilities and insurance—with their mastercardbranded cards third we seek to increase usage of our programs at selected 

  

merchants by sponsoring a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis we also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of mastercardbranded programs or indicating a preference for mastercardbranded programs when accepting payments from consumers 

contactless payment solutions  our acceptance initiatives include mastercard paypass a “contactless” payment solution that utilizes wireless technology to enable consumers simply to tap their payment card or other payment device such as a phone key fob wristband or mobile paypass tag that adheres to the back of a mobile device on a paypassenabled terminal to complete a transaction our paypass program primarily targets low value purchases and is designed to help our customers further expand their businesses by capturing a portion of transactions that were previously cashbased resulting in increased card activity paypass reduces transaction times which appeals to merchants in quick service businesses ie ballparks fast food restaurants and gas stations and allows us to expand the number of locations that accept our cards we have also developed an innovative transit platform solution to address the needs of various transit acceptance environments and cardholders paypass programs expanded in 2010 to include customers and merchants in 36 countries as of december 31 2010 an increase from 33 countries as of december 31 2009 as of december 31 2010 approximately 88 million paypass cards and devices were issued globally with acceptance at approximately 276000 merchant locations worldwide 

additional services in addition we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner is typically a charitable educational or other nonprofit organization 

merchants merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard in particular large merchants are supporting many of the litigation legislative and regulatory challenges related to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending against since interchange fees can represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” and “risk factors—business risks—merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in part i item 1a nevertheless we believe many opportunities exist to enhance our relationships with merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards over the years for example we have made available directly to merchants our standards that apply to card acceptance and related activities thereby increasing the level of transparency and predictability of our payment system for merchants we have also recently introduced a suite of information products data analytics and marketing services which can help merchants understand specific activity in their industry evaluate their sales performance against competitors and focus direct marketing efforts to target desirable prospects and hard to reach segments

mastercard revenue sources 

mastercard generates revenues by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and assessing our customers based on gdv on the cards that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted both by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards carrying our brands our net revenues are classified into the following five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers a combination of the following factors determines the pricing 

 

  

  

  

  

 crossborder transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements revenues from processing crossborder transactions fluctuate with crossborder activities see “risk factors—business risks—a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions” in part i item 1a 

  

in 2010 net revenues from our five largest customers accounted for approximately 15 billion or 28 of our total revenue no single customer generated greater than 10 of total revenue

 membership standards 

we establish and enforce our standards surrounding membership in mastercard international and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and enforcement 

membership in mastercard international and its affiliates is generally open to financial institutions and other entities that are our customers applicants for membership must generally meet specified membership eligibility requirements 

in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to perform all obligations required of members licenses provide members with certain rights including access to the network and usage of our brands antimoney laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission as well as on existing members all applicants and members must meet the requirements of mastercard’s antimoney laundering program and mastercard can block authorization of transactions and ultimately terminate membership for noncompliance with the program as a condition of our licenses members agree to comply with our standards which include our certificate of incorporation bylaws policies rules and operating regulations and procedures mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce our standards which relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement and member failures to help ensure that members conform to the standards we review card programs proposed by members 

customer risk management 

as a guarantor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2500 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 3400 affiliate debit licensees our estimated gross settlement risk exposure for mastercardbranded transactions which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 285 billion as of december 31 2010 principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members approximately 19400 

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor the financial health of economic and political operating environments of and compliance with our standards by our principal members affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses if the financial condition of a member or the state of the economy in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or to other 

  

mastercard members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of standby letters of credit bank guarantees or secured cash accounts as of december 31 2010 we had members who had posted approximately 30 billion in collateral held for settlement exposure for mastercardbranded transactions if a member becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other members we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to our members or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership additionally and to further preserve payment system integrity mastercard reserves the right to terminate a member’s right to participate in mastercard’s payment card network if for example the member fails or refuses to make payments in the ordinary course of business or if a liquidating agent conservator or receiver is appointed for the member in addition to these measures we have also established a 275 billion committed credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of member settlement failure see “risk factors—business risks—as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations” in part i item 1a see also “risk factors—business risks—unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business” in part i item 1a 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payment system can be affected by fraudulent activity and illegal uses of cards and our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information often resulting from security breaches of third party systems that inappropriately store cardholder account data see “risk factors—business risks—account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in part i item 1a fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as ecommerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt or the presence of the card or merchant agent is unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to help ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents key compliance programs include merchant audits for high fraud excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions and security compliance including our mastercard site data protection service ®  which assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises by requiring proper adherence to the payment card industry data security standards pci dds our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate 

our customers generally are responsible for fraud losses associated with the cards they issue and the merchants from which they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of mastercard cards we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help prevent fraud including mastercard securecode ®  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique personal code and our site data protection program we also provide fraud detection and prevention solutions including ems and datacash fraud prevention tools 

  

enterprise risk management 

mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability we have an enterprise risk management “erm” program which is integrated with the business and designed to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of risk the erm program leverages our business processes to among other things ensure allocation of resources to appropriately address risk establishment of clear accountability for risk management and provision of transparency of risks to senior management the board of directors and appropriate board committees our erm program seeks to accomplish these goals by identifying prioritizing and monitoring key risks providing an independent view of our risk profile and strengthening business operations by integrating erm principles and continuing to create a risk aware culture within mastercard mastercard’s integrated risk management structure balances risk and return by having business units and central functions such as finance and law identify own and manage risks our executive officers set policy and accountability and the board and committees provide oversight of the process 

intellectual property 

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard ®  maestro ® and cirrus ®  through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used andor properly maintained through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards contactless mobile electronic commerce security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations patents are of varying duration dcpending on the jurisdiction and filing date and will typically expire at the end of their natural term 

competition 

general mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased payment systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments as a result of a global trend electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment and card brands such as mastercard visa american express and discover are benefiting from this displacement however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume

 government regulation 

general government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years including in the united states regulators in several countries outside of the united states have also become increasingly interested in payment issues a number of which have launched official proceedings related to payment industry issues see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

interchange fees interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions such challenges include regulatory proceedings in the european union by the european commission as well as by individual european union member states and elsewhere interchange fees have also become the subject of legislative action in particular the wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted into law in july 2010 provides for among other things the regulation of debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” directly and through an implementing rulemaking process undertaken by the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” and “the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse effect on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in part i item 1a and in note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

data protection and information security aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue our customers in the united states are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers 

  

in the united states during the past several years a number of bills have been considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues congress continues to consider these issues which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers for example the house of representatives has again passed comprehensive data security and data breach notification legislation that could impose additional regulatory burdens on us and our customers similar legislation has not yet passed the senate in this congress and it is not clear whether legislation of this type will be signed into law in addition a large number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach in europe the european parliament and council passed the european directive 9546ec the “directive” on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject the directive establishes general principles with regard to the processing of personal data including the legal grounds for processing the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the european economic area and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data in addition to the united states and europe other jurisdictions around the world are enacting similar privacy data protection and information security regulations which have similar impacts to our businesses in these jurisdictions see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use and or security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs” in part i item 1a 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352 of the usa patriot act which applies to certain types of financial institutions including operators of credit card systems section 352 of the usa patriot act requires mastercard to maintain a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and imposes similar requirements on some of our customers our antimoney laundering program must be reasonably designed to prevent our system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities the program must at a minimum include the designation of a compliance officer provide for the training of appropriate personnel regarding antimoney laundering responsibilities as well as incorporate policies procedures and controls to mitigate money laundering risks and be independently audited 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by ofac restricting financial transactions with cuba burmamyanmar iran and sudan and with persons and entities included in ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” cuba iran sudan and syria also have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in these countries there are financial institutions licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries mastercard takes measures to avoid transactions with persons and entities on the sdn list however it is possible that transactions involving persons or entities on the sdn list may be processed through our payment system it is possible that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions’ association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

financial industry regulation  mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology 

  

service providers examinations by the ffiec cover areas such as data integrity and data security in recent years the us federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures affecting credit card payment terms and requiring more conservative accounting greater risk management and in some cases higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders in addition mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk 

in july 2010 as part of the wall street reform and consumer protection act the bureau of consumer financial protection the “bureau” was created the bureau will have significant authority to regulate consumer financial products including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products although it is not clear whether andor to what extent the bureau will be authorized to regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations in addition the financial reform act created the financial stability oversight council the “council” in order to identify risks to the financial stability of the united states that could arise from the material financial distress or failure of or ongoing activities by large interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies among other responsibilities the council is tasked with identifying payment clearing and settlement systems that are “systemically important” under the applicable statutory standard under the wall street reform and consumer protection act such systems will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements it is not clear whether mastercard would be deemed “systemically important” however the imposition of any additional regulatory or other obligations on mastercard could result in costly new compliance burdens that could negatively impact our business see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in part i item 1a 

issuer practice legislation and regulation the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system is continuing the process of issuing regulations to implement the credit card act which was signed into law in may 2009 the credit card act and its implementing regulations are having a significant impact on the disclosures made by our customers and on our customers’ account terms and business practices the credit card act and its implementing regulations are making it more difficult for credit card issuers to price credit cards for future credit risk and will have a significant effect on the pricing credit allocation and business models of most major credit card issuers the new law could reduce credit availability or increase the cost of credit to cardholders possibly affecting mastercard transaction volume and revenues 

the credit card act also includes provisions that impose limits and restrictions on certain prepaid card products including on fees the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system has issued implementing regulations with respect to these provisions the statutory provisions and implementing regulations may diminish the attractiveness of these products to our customers and may consequently adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues 

the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system has also recently adopted regulations regulating overdraft fees imposed in connection with atm and debit card transactions these regulations will have the effect of significantly reducing overdraft fees our customers may charge in connection with debit card programs this may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our customers and may adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues 

regulation of internet transactions  in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is implemented through a federal regulation compliance was required no later than june 1 2010 although congress may consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate internet gambling the federal regulation requires us and our customers to implement compliance programs that would increase our costs andor could decrease our 

  

transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as prepaid cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth

 item 1a risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks 

interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations 

interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant financial institution the acquirer to the cardholder financial institution the issuer in connection with transactions initiated on our payment system 

we do not earn revenues from interchange fees they are however a key factor in balancing the costs consumers pay and the costs merchants pay in our payment system they are also a factor on which we compete with other payment providers and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transactions we process 

  

over our network although we have historically set default interchange fees in the united states and other countries in certain jurisdictions our interchange rates and related practices including our default interchange fees are subject to increased litigation and government regulation as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries as well as merchants are seeking to reduce these fees through litigation regulatory action andor legislative action 

increased legislative scrutiny in the united states is resulting in limitations on our ability to establish default interchange rates for debit transactions in july 2010 the united states enacted into law the wall street reform and consumer protection act that among other things requires debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” to be “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction” see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in this part i item 1a for more detail interchange fees also have been the subject of legislative activity elsewhere including 

 

  

  

  

 in addition regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions around the world have commenced proceedings or inquiries into interchange fees and related practices examples include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a detailed description of regulatory proceedings and inquiries into interchange fees we believe that regulators are increasingly cooperating on interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—new regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products” in this part i item 1a 

additionally merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees through litigation in the united states merchants have filed approximately 50 class action or individual suits alleging that mastercard’s interchange fees and acceptance rules violate federal antitrust laws these suits allege among other things that our purported setting of interchange fees constitutes horizontal pricefixing between and among mastercard and its member banks and mastercard visa and their member banks in violation of section 1 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade the suits seek treble damages attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees issuers may be unable to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers also could charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable to consumers and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge this could also result in less innovation and product offerings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have a more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to its competitors if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees any such legislation regulation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations in addition regulatory proceedings and litigation could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations 

the wall street reform and consumer protection act recently enacted in the united states establishes regulation and oversight by the us federal reserve board of debit interchange rates and certain other network 

  

industry practices among other things it requires debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” referred to in the wall street reform and consumer protection act as fees established charged or received by a payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in an electronic debit transaction to be “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction” proposed regulations by the federal reserve provide two alternative proposals for determining whether a debit interchange fee complies with the “reasonable and proportional” standard one alternative would impose a range for a pertransaction interchange fee and the other would impose a simple cap in each case the federal reserve’s proposed debit interchange limits are significantly below the interchange fees card issuers currently receive provided certain conditions are met the proposed regulations exempt from the proposed interchange fee restrictions the following 1 issuers with assets of less than 10 billion 2 debit cards issued pursuant to a governmentadministered program and 3 general use prepaid cards not marketed or labeled as gift cards also while the proposed regulations do not directly regulate network fees they make clear that network fees cannot be used to circumvent the debit interchange fee restrictions see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in this part i item 1a 

additionally the wall street reform and consumer protection act provides that neither an issuer nor a payment card network may establish exclusive debit network arrangements or inhibit the ability of a merchant to choose among different networks for routing debit transactions under alternative rules proposed by the federal reserve either 1 a debit card would meet the requirements of the wall street reform and consumer protection act as long as it could be used in at least two unaffiliated networks or 2 each debit card would be required to function in at least two unaffiliated networks for each method of authorization that the cardholder could use for transactions  ie  two signature andor two pin networks 

the wall street reform and consumer protection act also created two new independent regulatory bodies in the financial reserve system the bureau will have significant authority to regulate consumer financial products including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products although it is not clear whether andor to what extent the bureau will be authorized to regulate broader aspects of payment card network operations the council is tasked among other responsibilities with identifying “systemically important” payment clearing and settlement systems that will be subject to new regulation supervision and examination requirements although it is not clear whether mastercard would be deemed “systemically important” under the applicable statutory standard if mastercard were deemed “systemically important” it could be subject to new risk management regulations relating to its payment clearing and settlement activities new regulations could address areas such as risk management policies and procedures collateral requirements participant default policies and procedures the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transactions and capital and financial resource requirements also a “systemically important” payment system could be required to obtain prior approval from the us board of governors of the federal reserve system or another federal agency for changes to its system rules procedures or operations that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payment system these developments or actions could increase the cost of operating our business and may make payment card transactions less attractive to card issuers as well as consumers this could result in a reduction in our payments volume and revenues 

if issuers acquirers andor merchants modify their business operations or otherwise take actions in response to this legislation which have the result of reducing the number of debit transactions we process or the network fees we collect the wall street reform and consumer protection act could have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations failure by our customers or by us to adjust our strategies successfully to compete in the new environment would increase this impact 

  

new regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products 

regulators around the world increasingly look at each other’s approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries consequently a development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other countries states or regions this includes the interpretation of the recent wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulatory and legislative activity relating to interchange similarly new laws and regulations in a country state or region involving one product may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another product for example regulations like those affecting debit payments could lead to regulations affecting credit and general use prepaid cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks— government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues” in this part i item 1a 

as a result the risks created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product these include matters like interchange rates network standards and network exclusivity and routing agreements conversely if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our products services fees and other important aspects of our business with the same effect either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

government actions may prevent us from competing effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries such as russia ukraine and india have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card and processing providers these governments may take this action to support these providers they may also take this action to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies as an example governments in certain countries are considering or may consider regulatory requirements that mandate processing of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies such a development would prevent us from utilizing our global processing capabilities for customers our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volumes and revenues 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently mastercard is at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years see “business—government regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation in addition to the wall street reform and consumer protection act examples include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which could reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs 

we and our customers are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we and our customers could be negatively impacted by these regulations recently these topics have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united states at both the federal and state level in europe and in other jurisdictions around the world regulation of privacy and data protection and information security in these and other jurisdictions may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment cards which may in turn decrease the number of our cards that they issue any additional regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations which could materially and adversely affect our profitability finally failure to comply with the privacy and data protection and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

  

if the approval of the settlements of our currency conversion cases is undermined by an appeal and we are unsuccessful in any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we generate significant revenue from processing crossborder currency transactions for customers however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in july 2006 mastercard and other defendants in federal class actions related to these matters entered into agreements to settle or otherwise dispose of such matters pursuant to the settlement agreements mastercard has paid 72 million to be used for the defendants’ settlement fund to settle the federal actions and 13 million to settle state cases while the federal court has granted final approval of the settlement agreements the settlements are subject to appeals if an appeal is filed and we are unsuccessful in that appellate proceeding the settlement agreements will terminate if that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits or the state currency conversion cases we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards in another country or may be required to modify our currency conversion practices see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

except as discussed in note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 we have not established reserves for any of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future we may determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any of our legal proceedings is required including charges related to legal fees in addition we may be required to record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of reserves that we have previously recorded such charges particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit in 2003 merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 these limitations and any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

potential changes in the tax laws applicable to us could materially increase our tax payments 

potential changes in existing tax laws such as recent proposals for fundamental tax reform in the united states including the treatment of earnings of controlled foreign corporations may impact our effective tax rate see also note 21 income tax to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

  

business risks 

our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments within the global general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa american express discover and jcb among others visa has significantly greater volume than we do and has greater scale and market share as well as strong brand recognition which provides significant competitive advantages moreover some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcomes of litigation regulatory proceedings and legislative activity 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate endtoend payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without involving intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of endtoend payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of four party payments systems such as ours in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition these competitors have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours certain competitors may also hold competitive advantages as a result of their organizational structures see “business—competition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth our customers can also develop their own competitive services as a result our revenue or profitability could decline we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems ecommerce payment systems and payment systems for mobile devices a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we also expect that there may be other changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 

  

  

   

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our business revenue and profitability 

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

in the future we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers resulting in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future recent consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the substantial loss of business for mastercard which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

the continued consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which mastercard has a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

  

our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term if we lose a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest significant customers which could have a material adverse longterm impact on our business 

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2010 the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 15 billion or 28 of total revenue loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard some large merchants are supporting many of the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees and related practices have been receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” also see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings 

merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives 

certain customers have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and may have a material adverse impact on our business 

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from mastercard to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our central processing systems because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payment system among regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the marketplace’s perception of our brands and reputation 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to our branded products depends highly upon the external perception of our company and industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brands such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our business 

  

if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth 

in recent years industrywide signaturebased and pinbased debit transactions have grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions however in the united states transactions involving our brands account for a smaller share of all signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low penetration in the united states we may not be able to increase our penetration for debit transactions in the united states since many of our competitors have longstanding and strong positions although this could be impacted by the federal reserve’s implementation of network exclusivity rules under the wall street reform and consumer protection act we may also be impacted adversely by the tendency among us consumers and merchants to migrate from signaturebased debit transactions to pinbased transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions in addition pinbased transactions are more likely to be processed by other atmdebit pointofsale networks than by us any of these factors may inhibit the growth of our debit business which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and overall prospects for future growth 

unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention in particular the economies of the united states and the united kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil and it has also impacted other economies around the world more recently european countries including portugal ireland greece and spain have experienced downgrades in sovereign credit ratings by rating agencies driven by fiscal challenges some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis and the state of economic environments the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present as a result our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted or we may be impacted in several ways see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—business environment” in part ii item 7 for a full discussion 

any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and transaction processing fees revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with 

  

crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu such as h1n1 viruses such as sars and other diseases any such decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

general economic and global political conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our revenue and profitability 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment housing and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands also as we are principally based in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business prospects and growth 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations 

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons if a principal member or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard international is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations our estimated mastercardbranded gross legal settlement exposure which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 285 billion as of december 31 2010 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 275 billion which could be used for general corporate purposes including to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in the event that mastercard international effects a payment on behalf of a failed member mastercard international may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables from its members subject to approval by our board of directors members may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during these ordinary course activities of mastercard while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by any of our largest customers on their peak day concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest customers or of several of our smaller customers may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition moreover during 2010 many of our financial institution customers continued to be directly and adversely impacted by the unprecedented events in the financial markets which began during 2008 and the economic turmoil that has ensued around the world these events present increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees for more information on our settlement exposure as of december 31 2010 see note 23 settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions as a result of process or other technology malfunction fire natural or manmade disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism accident or other catastrophic events a disaster or other problem at 

  

our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services our visibility in the global payments industry may also attract terrorists activists or hackers to attack our facilities or systems leading to service interruptions increased costs or data security compromises additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed markets could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those markets if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue 

we our customers merchants and other third parties store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards bearing our brands in addition our customers may sponsor thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage the reputation of our brands and lead to claims against us in recent years there have been several highprofile account data compromise events involving merchants and third party payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affected millions of mastercard visa discover and american express cardholders as a result of such data security breaches we may be subject to lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands while most of these lawsuits do not involve direct claims against us in certain circumstances we could be exposed to damage claims which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our profitability any damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes revenue and prospects for future growth or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeit or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance adoption of new technologies or enhanced security requirements as well as damage to our reputation and financial damage which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which could reduce our revenue and income or limit our future growth 

the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a 

  

need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes by the complexity of our systems or by intellectual property rights of third parties we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies suggesting that we may be infringing a preexisting patent or that we need to license use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our operations outside of the united states 

during 2010 approximately 584 of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we do not adequately manage the changes necessary to implement our strategy our results of operations may suffer 

mastercard continues to experience a significant amount of changes associated with items related to our strategy including changes in technology the marketplace our customers and our products in particular our expansion into new businesses could result in unanticipated or unfamiliar issues which may be difficult to manage if not adequately managed these changes could result in missed opportunities for the business or could impact the effectiveness of our organization’s execution of its strategy as we manage these changes any difficulty in retaining or attracting key management and employees could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets necessary for the organization’s effective execution of its strategy 

acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition or reputation 

although we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies in addition the integration of any acquisition or investment including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition any of these acquisitions could also result in control issues which could negatively affect our reputation although we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisitions 

  

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure 

future sales of our shares of class a common stock could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future as of february 16 2011 we had 123656120 outstanding shares of class a common stock of which 13108364 shares were owned by the mastercard foundation the “foundation” under the terms of the donation the foundation became able to sell its shares of our class a common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo in may 2006 to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements under canadian tax law the foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 35 of its assets not used in administration of the foundation in qualified charitable disbursements however the foundation has obtained permission from the canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to ten years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the tenyear period despite this permission to defer annual disbursements the foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year in addition the foundation will be permitted to sell all of the remaining shares held by it starting twenty years and eleven months after the consummation of the ipo 

the market price of our common stock could be volatile 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations and have experienced increased volatility in connection with recent unpredictable economic events around the world this market volatility as well as the factors listed below among others could affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 there are terms in our charter documents and under delaware law that could be considered antitakeover provisions or could have an impact on a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further except in limited circumstances no member or former member of mastercard international or any operator member or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

as of february 16 2011 the foundation owns 13108364 shares of class a common stock representing approximately 106 of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to the date which is twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our members the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our holders of class a common stock and class b common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

mastercard intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely the payment of dividends is dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition settlement guarantees operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs if as a consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make or may have to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payments company that provides a critical economic link among financial institutions businesses merchants cardholders and governments worldwide enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks we provide a variety of services in support of the credit debit prepaid and related payment programs of approximately 22000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers we primarily 

 

  

  

  

  

 we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as payment card transactions creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term our focus is on continuing to 

 

  

  

 see “—business environment” for a discussion of environmental considerations related to our longterm strategic objectives 

we recorded net income of 18 billion or 1405 per diluted share in 2010 versus net income of 15 billion or 1116 per diluted share in 2009 and a net loss of 03 billion or 194 per diluted share in 2008 as of december 31 2010 our liquidity and capital positions remained strong with 39 billion in cash and cash equivalents and current availableforsale securities and 52 billion in equity in addition we generated cash flows from operations of 17 billion for the year ended december 31 2010  

our net revenues increased 86 in 2010 primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands pricing changes and increased transactions the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real reduced net revenue growth by 

  

approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 our net revenues increased 21 in 2009 primarily due to increased transactions pricing changes and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands partially offset by approximately 2 percentage points relating to the us dollar average exchange rates strengthening versus the euro and brazilian real historically we experienced greater growth in net revenues than the revenue growth in 2009 the lower growth rate reflected the impact of the global economic environment in 2009 which negatively affected our customers and their cardholders 

our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending changes in cardholder spending behavior influenced by economic environments have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to grow our revenues our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction in 2010 our processed transactions increased 29 and our volumes increased 91 on a local currency basis in 2009 while our processed transactions increased 69 our volumes only increased 17 on a local currency basis reflecting a decline in the average amount per transaction our growth in processed transactions in 2010 was lower than in 2009 primarily due to debit portfolio losses in the us and uk 

during 2010 net pricing actions contributed approximately 5 percentage points to our net revenue growth these net pricing actions included the effects of price increases during 2009 and 2010 which were partially offset by an increase in crossborder rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the european commission during 2009 net pricing actions contributed approximately 6 percentage points to our net revenue growth these net pricing actions included price increases in 2009 partially offset by an increase in crossborder rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the european commission overall net revenue growth in 2010 and 2009 was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 267 241 and 227 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

our operating expenses decreased 18 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses the decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower personnel expenses partially offset by increased professional fees the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and the brazilian real reduced expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 

operating expenses decreased 486 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower litigation settlements excluding the impact of the litigation settlements identified in the reconciliation table included in “—operating expenses” operating expenses declined 69 in 2009 compared to 2008 in 2009 we realigned our resources and implemented contingency plans in response to the global economic and business environment at that time 

our ratios of operating income loss as a percentage of net revenues or operating margins were 497 in 2010 versus 443 in 2009 and 107 in 2008 in 2008 excluding the impact of the litigation settlements the operating margin was 390 

other income expense varies depending on activities not core to our operations other income expense increased in 2010 from 2009 including the effects of decreased interest expense on litigation settlements and uncertain tax positions in 2009 we did not have significant activity comparable to gains realized in 2008 as to income tax expense benefit effective income tax rates were 330 341 and 337 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively

business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies revenue generated in the united states was approximately 416 424 and 441 of total revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period but differences in market maturity economic health price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention in particular the economies of the united states and the united kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil and it has also impacted other economies around the world more recently european countries including portugal ireland greece and spain have experienced downgrades in sovereign credit ratings by ratings agencies driven by fiscal challenges some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential further changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis and the state of economic environments the severity of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present as a result our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted or the company may be impacted in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and part i item 1a risk factors for further discussion in particular in july 2010 the united states enacted into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in part i item 1a for further discussion including with respect to 1 regulation providing for limitations on debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” 2 regulation prohibiting exclusive debit network arrangements and routing restrictions for debit and 3 the creation of independent regulatory bodies with the authority to regulate consumer financial products and potentially broader aspects of payment card network operations eg the ability to deem mastercard “systematically important” see also “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—new regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products” in part i item 1a 

mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry for example in our asiapacific and latin american regions we have now experienced several quarters of significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the us we have observed mixed economic indicators including retail spending and unemployment rates notwithstanding some encouraging trends the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business 

  

financial results 

during 2009 the company 1 modified its presentation of details of the company’s major revenue categories included within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the “mda” and 2 reclassified certain cardholderrelated enhancement expenses the modifications to the presentation within this mda of the detail of the company’s revenue categories did not result in any changes to the company’s historical financial statements and had no effect on the overall calculation of net revenue presented in the financial statements the reclassification of certain cardholderrelated enhancement expenses did not result in any impact to the company’s overall operating expenses 

our operating results for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

  

  

    

 impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar for 2010 as compared to 2009 the us dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and weakened against the brazilian real the net foreign currency impact of these changes unfavorably impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point and favorably impacted expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 for 2009 as compared to 2008 the us dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and brazilian real which resulted in lower revenues and expenses 

in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv on a local currency basis in 2010 gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased 107 versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 91 in 2009 gdv on a us dollar converted basis declined 30 versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 17 

revenues 

revenue descriptions 

mastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders merchants issuers the cardholders’ banks and acquirers the merchants’ banks our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other paymentrelated services we provide to our customers our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro and brazilian real 

we process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system providing cardholders with the ability to utilize and merchants to accept mastercard cards across multiple country borders we process most of the crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and among our largest markets process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states united kingdom canada and brazil 

our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers a combination of the following factors determines the pricing 

 

   

  

  

  

 crossborder transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions since crossborder fees are higher than domestic fees we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 

the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 revenue analysis 

in 2010 and 2009 gross revenues grew 125 and 40 respectively revenue growth in 2010 was primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands higher pricing and increased transactions the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and the brazilian real reduced revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 revenue growth in 2009 was primarily due to changes in pricing increased transactions and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 267 241 and 227 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our net revenues in 2010 and 2009 increased 86 and 21 versus 2009 and 2008 respectively 

our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction in 2010 our processed transactions increased 29 and our volumes increased 91 on a local currency basis in 2009 while our processed transactions increased 69 our volumes only increased 17 on a local currency basis reflecting a decline in the average amount per transaction our growth in processed transactions in 2010 was lower than in 2009 primarily due to debit portfolio losses in the us and uk 

pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 5 percentage points in 2010 these net pricing changes primarily related to increases in crossborder volume fees in october 2009 partially offset by approximately 3 percentage points attributable to increased crossborder rebates increases in domestic assessments in april 2010 and increases in transaction processing fees in april 2009 the net pricing change also included an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the october 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of june 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the european commission see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more information 

  

the pricing structure for our acquirer revenues from crossborder transactions was simplified in the fourth quarter of 2010 pursuant to the previous structure mastercard charged a crossborder volume fee but provided a rebate if mastercard was allowed to perform the currency conversion beginning in october 2010 if mastercard performs the currency conversion the cross border volume fee charged is lower and no rebate is provided this prospective change has no impact to net revenues 

pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 6 percentage points in 2009 the price increases primarily related to increases to transaction processing fees in april 2009 and crossborder volume fees in october 2009 the net pricing change included an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to an increase in crossborder rebates to encourage certain behaviors of customers and an approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the october 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of june 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the european commission 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2010 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 15 billion or 28 of total net revenues the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income see “risk factors—business risks—additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers resulting in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a 

the significant components of our net revenues were as follows 

 

 domestic assessments— there was an increase in domestic assessments of 109 in 2010 as compared to a 02 decrease in 2009 due to 

 

  

   

  

 crossborder volume fees— there was an increase in crossborder volume fees of 277 in 2010 as compared to a 25 decrease in 2009 due to 

 

  

 the decrease in 2009 crossborder volume fees was partially offset by approximately 7 percentage points relating to pricing changes during 2009 the crossborder pricing actions also included an increase to crossborder rebates as discussed in the rebates and incentives discussion below in addition approximately 1 percentage point of the 7 percentage point pricing increase was associated with certain pricing changes implemented in october 2008 and repealed at the end of june 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the european commission see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more information 

 

 transaction processing fees— the increases in transaction processing fees of 76 and 149 during 2010 and 2009 respectively were due to 

 

  

  

   

other revenues— the increases in 2010 and 2009 of 10 and 44 respectively were due to 

 

  

  

 rebates and incentives— rebates and incentives increased 248 and 101 in 2010 and 2009 respectively rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 267 241 and 227 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the amount of rebates and incentives increased due to the following 

 

  

  

 operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing litigation settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses during 2009 the company reclassified certain cardholderrelated enhancement expenses which were previously classified as advertising and marketing expenses to general and administrative expenses these cardholder benefit programs such as insurance and card replacements were previously deemed promotional features of the cards and over time have become standard product offerings in certain card categories approximately 83 million of these expenses have been reclassified in 2008 to conform to the 2009 presentation 

  

the major components of our operating expenses were as follows 

 

 operating expenses decreased 52 million or 18 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses partially offset by increased advertising and marketing expenses the impact of foreign currency relating to translation from the euro and brazilian real to us dollars reduced operating expenses by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010 

operating expenses decreased approximately 27 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 these changes in operating expenses were primarily due to decreased litigation settlements in 2009 in addition in 2009 mastercard initiated resource realignment programs which increased personnel costs due to severancerelated expenses and implemented contingency plans which reduced certain other operating expenses the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses excluding the litigation settlements which is a nongaap financial measure to the operating expenses including the litigation settlements which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement management believes this analysis may be helpful in evaluating ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods 

 

  

    

general and administrative 

the major components of general and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

advertising and marketing 

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness preference and usage through integrated advertising sponsorship promotional interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale we will also continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences 

advertising and marketing expenses increased 26 million or 35 in 2010 mainly due to customerspecific initiatives and sponsorships in 2009 advertising and marketing expenses decreased 179 million or 192 primarily due to cost management initiatives and market realities additionally the impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of amounts from the euro and the brazilian real to us dollars reduced advertising and marketing expenses by approximately 1 percentage point and 2 percentage points in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

litigation settlements 

expense for litigation settlements was 50 million 70 million and 25 billion for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for information on litigation settlements 

in 2008 mastercard and visa inc “visa” entered into a settlement agreement with discover the “discover settlement” relating to the us federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties the discover settlement ended all litigation among the parties for a total of 28 billion previously mastercard and visa entered into a judgment sharing agreement in accordance with the terms of the judgment sharing agreement mastercard’s share of the discover settlement was 863 million which was paid to discover in november 2008 additionally in connection with the discover settlement morgan stanley discover’s former parent company paid mastercard 35 million in november 2008 pursuant to a separate agreement the net pretax expense of 828 million was recorded in litigation settlements in 2008 

also in 2008 mastercard entered into a settlement agreement with american express which ended all existing litigation between american express and mastercard the “american express settlement” under the terms of the american express settlement beginning on september 15 2008 mastercard is required to pay american express up to 150 million each quarter for 12 quarters payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter for a maximum amount of 18 billion the charge is based on mastercard’s assumption that american express will achieve certain financial performance hurdles the quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15 of american express’ united states global network services billings during the quarter up to a maximum of 150 million per quarter if however the payment for any quarter is less than 150 million the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between 150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall mastercard recorded the present value of 18 billion at a 575 discount rate or 16 billion pretax in 2008 

in 2003 mastercard entered into a settlement agreement the “us merchant lawsuit settlement” related to the us merchant lawsuit described under the caption “us merchant and consumer litigations” in note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and recorded a pretax charge of 721 million consisting of i the monetary amount of the us merchant lawsuit settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant lawsuit settlement and iii costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit the 721 million pretax charge amount was an estimate which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors on july 1 2009 mastercard entered into 

  

an agreement the “prepayment agreement” with plaintiffs of the us merchant lawsuit settlement whereby mastercard agreed to make a prepayment of its remaining 400 million in payment obligations at a discounted amount of 335 million the company paid 335 million on september 30 2009 in accordance with the prepayment agreement 

we recorded liabilities for these and certain other litigation settlements in 2010 and prior years total liabilities for litigation settlements changed from december 31 2008 as follows 

 

 depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 7 million or 48 and 29 million or 262 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the net increases in depreciation and amortization expense in both years reflected increased investments in data center equipment capitalized software and leasehold and building improvements additionally in 2010 the increase included the amortization of intangible assets from the datacash acquisition see note 2 acquisition of datacash group plc to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 in 2009 the increase included depreciation on the company’s global technology and operations center which was acquired under a capital lease arrangement in 2009 we expect that depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as we continue to invest in property plant and equipment and software 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense and other gains and losses the components of other income expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were as shown below 

 

  

   

  

  

 income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 330 341 and 337 respectively the tax rate for 2010 was lower than the tax rate for 2009 due primarily to the 2010 impact of actual and anticipated repatriations from foreign subsidiaries partially offset by discrete adjustments in 2010 and 2009 the tax rate for 2009 was higher than the tax rate for 2008 due primarily to litigation settlement charges recorded in 2008 which resulted in a pretax loss in a higher tax rate jurisdiction and pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions in addition deferred tax assets were remeasured and reduced by 15 million and 21 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively due to changes in our state effective tax rate as a result of the remeasurements our income tax expense was increased for the same amounts 

the components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 are as follows 

 

   

the company’s gaap effective income tax rate for 2008 was significantly affected by the tax benefits related to the charges for the litigation settlements due to the nonrecurring nature of these items the company believes that the calculation of the 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates excluding the impacts of the litigation settlements which are nongaap financial measures will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 which are the most directly comparable gaap measures 

 

  

  

  during 2010 the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by 19 million the increase in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for 2010 is primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions as of december 31 2010 the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior periods were 165 million all of which would reduce the company’s effective tax rate if recognized 

the company’s operations are conducted in various geographies with different tax rates as the company’s operations evolve this may impact the company’s future effective tax rate as a result of the company’s expansion in its business activities in asia pacific with its regional headquarters in singapore it received a tax incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance the incentive is effective as of january 1 2010 and provides for a 5 income tax rate based on annual taxable income in excess of a base amount for a 10year period the company did not recognize significant tax benefits in 2010 as a result of the incentive as its expansion commenced in november 2010 the company continues to explore additional opportunities in this region which may result in a tax rate potentially lower than 5 

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures to make continued investments in our business and to service our obligations related to litigation settlements at december 31 2010 and 2009 we had 39 billion and 29 billion respectively of cash and cash equivalents and current availableforsale securities to use for our operations our equity was 52 billion and 35 billion as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively

on december 9 2010 mastercard entered into an agreement to acquire travelex cpm pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement the company is expected to acquire travelex cpm at a purchase price of approximately 290 million uk pound sterling or approximately 458 million with contingent consideration an “earnout” of up to an additional 35 million uk pound sterling or approximately 55 million if certain performance targets are met the acquisition is expected to be consummated in the first half of 2011 

in september 2010 the company’s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to 1 billion of its class a common stock in open market transactions the company did not repurchase any shares under this plan during 2010 as of february 16 2011 the company had completed the repurchase of approximately 03 million shares of its class a common stock at a cost of approximately 75 million the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including legal requirements price and economic and market conditions 

we believe that the cash generated from operations our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital needs and litigation settlement obligations our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are still a party see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a note 20 obligations under litigation settlements and note 22 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and “—business environment” in part ii item 7 for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business

future obligations 

in addition to the 458 million commitment to purchase travelex cpm the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2010 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents 

 

  

       

  seasonality 

historically our quarterly gross revenues have been positively impacted in the fourth quarter by increases in purchase volume related to the holiday shopping period with corresponding higher rebates and incentives to our customers also operating expenses have historically been higher in the fourth quarter due to additional advertising and promotions related to the holiday period the economic crisis in 2008 caused our operating results to diverge from these historical trends as gross revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were negatively impacted by lower purchase volumes and transactions in response mastercard accelerated its cost savings initiatives in the quarter with particular focus on advertising personnel and travel expenses the results for the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2010 were more consistent with the historical trends 

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there 

  

were no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2010 as compared to december 31 2009 the wall street reform and consumer protection act includes provisions related to derivative financial instruments and the company is determining what impact if any such provisions will have on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies we also enter into forward contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than 18 months 

the table below shows a summary of derivative contracts classified by functional currency 

 

  

  

 our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of 16 other transaction currencies the remaining 134 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

  

interest rate risk

 item 1 business 

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit debit and related payment programs of approximately 23000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers through our threetiered business model as franchisor processor and advisor we develop and market payment solutions process payment transactions and provide support services to our customers and depending upon the service to merchants and other clients we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic™ maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our customers as part of managing these brands we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network mastercard generates revenue by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and assessing our customers based on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands 

a typical transaction processed over our network involves four parties in addition to us the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholder’s bank and the acquirer the merchant’s bank consequently the payment network we operate supports what is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system our customers are the financial institutions and other entities that act as issuers and acquirers using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient quick and secure payment method that is accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customers to ensure the integrity of our payment network in addition we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands however cardholder and merchant transaction relationships are managed principally by our customers 

  

accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

our business has a global reach and has continued to experience growth in 2009 we processed 224 billion transactions a 69 increase over the number of transactions processed in 2008 gross dollar volume “gdv” on cards carrying the mastercard brand as reported by our customers was approximately 25 trillion in 2009 a 33 decrease in us dollar terms and a 14 increase in local currency terms over the gdv reported in 2008 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as payment card transactions creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry such as premiumaffluent quickservicelow value commercialsmall business debit prepaid and issuer and acquirer processor services pursuing domestic processing opportunities throughout the world enhancing our merchant relationships expanding points of acceptance for our brands seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world we are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated and dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing and consulting and information services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the long term we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time 

we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment in recent years we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny and other legal challenges particularly with respect to interchange fees interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers have been the subject of increased regulatory and legislative scrutiny as well as litigation as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers we do not earn revenues from interchange fees however if issuers were unable to collect interchange fees or were to receive reduced interchange fees we may experience a reduction in the number of customers willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system such as ours andor a reduction in the rate of number of cards issued as well as lower overall transaction volumes proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment may also become more attractive issuers might also decide to charge higher fees to cardholders thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability they also might attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge in addition to those challenges relating to interchange fees we are also exposed to a variety of significant lawsuits and regulatory actions including federal antitrust claims and claims under state unfair competition statutes see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

mastercard incorporated was incorporated as a delaware stock corporation in may 2001 we conduct our business principally through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” a delaware nonstock or membership corporation that was formed in november 1966 our customers are generally either principal members of mastercard international which participate directly in mastercard international’s business or affiliate members of mastercard international which participate indirectly in mastercard international’s business through a principal member in may 2006 we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure for mastercard incorporated including an initial public offering of a new class of common stock the “ipo” which we refer to as the “ownership and governance transactions” and which included the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors who are independent from our customers for more information about our capital structure voting rights of our common stock repurchases of our class a common stock and conversions of shares of our class b common stock into shares of our voting class a common stock see note 16 stockholders’ equity to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

  

our industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

 

  

  

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 

  

  

 generally cardbased forms of payment involve two types of transactions depending on the type of card being used transactions that typically require the cardholder’s signature which are referred to as offline transactions and transactions that require the cardholder to use a personal identification number “pin” for verification which are typically referred to as online transactions some purchase transactions outside of the united states such as those made using cards equipped with a chip can be pinauthenticated but are considered offline transactions in addition some payment cards are equipped with an rfid radio frequency identification microchip which provides an advanced authentication technique and technology which allows contactless payments requiring neither signature nor pin many merchants no longer require a signature for low value purchases and there is no pin or signature on internet or other cardnotpresent transactions such transactions are still considered however to be offline transactions 

the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard visa ®  american express ®  jcb ®  diners club ® and discover ®  historically these brands—including mastercard—were principally associated with “pay later” credit or charge cards in the united states and other major markets around the world today mastercard as well as visa and others may issue cards in the “pay now” and “pay before” categories as well 

“pay now” cards may be further categorized into several subsegments 

 

  

  

   

regional and domesticlocal pinbased debit brands are the primary brands in many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and other brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions 

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a portion of all cardbased forms of payment typically private label cards are “pay later” cards issued by or on behalf of a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at the issuing merchant’s locations 

payment services and solutions 

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services to our customers we also offer a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design package and implement programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers which include cardholders and commercial clients we deploy customer relationship management teams to our customers to provide them with customized solutions built upon our expertise in payment programs marketing product development payment processing technology and consulting and information services we also manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through brand advertising promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives 

we generate revenues from the fees we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services we also earn revenues by charging our customers assessments based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards carrying our brands 

transaction processing 

introduction we operate the mastercard worldwide network which links issuers and acquirers around the globe for transaction processing services and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards at millions of merchants worldwide a typical transaction processed over our network involves four participants in addition to us cardholder merchant issuer the cardholder’s bank and acquirer the merchant’s bank the following diagram depicts a typical pointofsale card transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder a purchases goods or services from a merchant b using a card after the transaction is authorized by the issuer d using our network the acquirer c pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount to the merchant this discount which we refer to as the merchant discount takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee described below the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus any interchange fee and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account our rules generally guarantee the payment of transactions using mastercardbranded cards and certain transactions using cirrus and maestrobranded cards between issuers and acquirers 

  

in this fourparty payment system the economics of a payment transaction relative to mastercard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over our network or a third party network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

a significant portion of the merchant discount is generally paid from the acquirer to the issuer or netted by the issuer against amounts paid to the acquirer in the form of an interchange fee the balance of the merchant discount is retained by the acquirer to cover its costs and profit margin acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers transactionbased and related fees and assessments for the services we provide them 

interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payment system costs among our customers participating in fourparty payment card systems generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and passed to issuers or netted by issuers against amounts paid to acquirers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers we establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process however we do not earn revenues from them as noted above interchange fees are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards and are currently subject to regulatory legislative andor legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a 

mastercard worldwide network  we facilitate the processing of transactions through the mastercard worldwide network our proprietary global payment network our transaction processing capabilities include our core processing—specifically transaction switching authorization clearing and settlement—as well as many valueadded payment processing services that extend our capabilities beyond switching in the payment value chain 

the mastercard worldwide network is managed principally through our global technology and operations headquarters in o’fallon missouri we process transactions through our network for approximately 23000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers through more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories we believe the architecture of our network is unique featuring a globally integrated structure which provides scalability for our customers and enables them to expand into regional and global markets our network also features an intelligent architecture which enables it to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structures—distributed peertopeer and centralized hubandspoke transactions that require fast reliable processing such as those submitted using a mastercard paypass ® enabled device in a tollway use the network’s distributed processing structure ensuring they are processed close to where the transaction occurred transactions that require valueadded processing such as realtime access to transaction data for fraud scoring or rewards at the point of sale or customization of transaction data for unique consumer spending controls use the network’s centralized processing structure ensuring advanced processing services are applied to the transaction 

typically operating at about 80 capacity our network can handle more than 140 million transactions per hour with an average network response time of 140 milliseconds and can substantially scale capacity to meet demand our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year our global payment network provides multiple levels of backup protection and related continuity procedures in the event of an outage should the issuer acquirer or payment network experience a service interruption to date we have consistently maintained availability of our global processing systems in more than 999 of the time

acceptance initiatives 

overview we estimate that as of december 31 2009 cards carrying the mastercard brand were accepted at 299 million acceptance locations including 17 million atms and 06 million other locations where cash may be obtained information on atm and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly 

  

based on publiclyavailable reports of payment industry associations government agencies and independent market analysts in canada and the united states cards bearing the maestro brand mark are accepted at many of these same locations 

initiatives we seek to maintain unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded programs by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the categories of merchants that accept cards carrying our brands we are focused on expanding acceptance in electronic and mobile commerce environments quick service businesses such as fast food restaurants transportation and public sector payments such as those involving taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories second we seek to increase the number of payment channels in which mastercard programs are accepted such as by introducing mastercard acceptance in connection with bill payment applications we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make bill payments in a variety of categories—including rent utilities and insurance—with their mastercardbranded cards third we seek to increase usage of our programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis we also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of mastercardbranded programs or indicate a preference for mastercardbranded programs when accepting payments from consumers 

contactless payment solutions  our acceptance initiatives include mastercard paypass a “contactless” payment solution that enables consumers simply to tap or wave their payment card or other payment device such as a phone key fob or wristband on a speciallyequipped terminal to complete a transaction paypass utilizes radio frequency technology to securely transmit payment details wirelessly to the payment card terminals for processing through our network our paypass program targets low value purchases and is designed to help our customers further expand their businesses by capturing a portion of transactions that were previously cashbased resulting in increased card activity paypass also reduces transaction times which appeals to merchants in quick service businesses and allows us to expand the number of locations that accept our cards paypass programs expanded in 2009 to include customers and merchants in 33 countries as of december 31 2009 an increase from 28 countries as of december 31 2008 as of december 31 2009 more than 70 million paypass cards and devices were issued globally with acceptance at approximately 200000 merchant locations worldwide 

additional services in addition we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner is typically a charity educational or other nonprofit organization 

merchants merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard in particular large merchants are supporting many of the legal legislative and regulatory challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” and “risk factors—business risks—merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in part i item 1a nevertheless we believe many opportunities exist to enhance our relationships with merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards over the years for example we have made available directly to merchants our rules that apply to card acceptance and related activities thereby increasing the level of transparency and predictability of our payment system for merchants we have also published the interchange rates applicable to merchants in the united states have introduced a cap on interchange fees on fuel purchases at petroleum retailers and have published our entire set of operating rules on our website as an additional example we have an advisory group 

  

which brings together merchants acquirers issuers and processors twice a year to examine payments innovation at the point of interaction and to seek to enhance the experience for merchants and consumers at the point of sale or in an online shopping environment for a retail sales transaction we also continue to develop our acquirer and merchant sales teams around the world moreover we have recently introduced a suite of information products data analytics and marketing services which can help merchants understand specific activity in their industry evaluate their sales performance against competitors and focus direct marketing efforts to target desirable prospects and hard to reach segments 

mastercard revenue sources 

mastercard processes transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system providing cardholders with the ability to utilize and merchants to accept mastercard cards across multiple country borders for example we may process a transaction in a merchant’s local currency however the charge for the transaction would appear on the cardholder’s statement in the cardholder’s home currency we process most of the crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states united kingdom canada brazil and australia 

mastercard generates revenues by charging fees to our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and assessing our customers based on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands our net revenues are classified into the following five categories 

 

  

  

  

   

rebates and incentives contrarevenue rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contrarevenue in the same period that performance occurs performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive including commitments to the agreement term hurdles for volumes transactions or issuance of new cards and the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements 

our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers a combination of the following factors determines the pricing 

 

  

  

  

  

 crossborder transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements revenues from processing crossborder transactions fluctuate with crossborder activities see “risk factors—business risks—a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions” in part i item 1a 

in 2009 net revenues from our five largest customers accounted for approximately 14 billion or 28 of our total revenue no single customer generated 10 of total revenue 

membership standards 

we establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding membership in mastercard international and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and enforcement 

membership in mastercard international and its affiliates is generally open to financial institutions and other entities that are our customers applicants for membership must generally meet specified membership eligibility requirements 

in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to perform all obligations required of members licenses provide members with certain rights including access to the network and usage of our brands antimoney laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission as well as on existing members all applicants and members must meet the requirements of mastercard’s antimoney laundering program and mastercard can block authorization of transactions and ultimately terminate membership for noncompliance with the program as a condition of our licenses members agree to comply with our bylaws policies rules and operating regulations and procedures the “standards” mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce the standards which relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement and member failures to help ensure that members conform to the standards we review card programs proposed by members 

  

customer risk management 

as a guarantor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2400 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 3500 affiliate debit licensees our estimated gross settlement risk exposure for mastercardbranded transactions which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 264 billion as of december 31 2009 principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members approximately 20400 

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor the financial health economic and political operating environments of and compliance with our rules and standards by our principal members affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses if the financial condition of a member or the state of the economy in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or other mastercard members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of standby letters of credit bank guarantees or secured cash accounts as of december 31 2009 we had members who had posted approximately 28 billion in collateral held for settlement exposure for mastercardbranded transactions if a member becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other members we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to our members or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership additionally and to further preserve payment system integrity mastercard reserves the right to terminate a member if for example the member fails or refuses to make payments in the ordinary course of business or if a liquidating agent conservator or receiver is appointed for the member in addition to these measures we have also established a 25 billion committed credit facility which by its terms will decrease to 20 billion in april 2010 for the final year of the facility for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure see “risk factors—business risks—as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal member and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations” in part i item 1a see also “risk factors—business risks—unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business” in part i item 1a 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payment system can be affected by fraudulent activity and illegal uses of our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information often resulting from security breaches of third party systems that inappropriately store cardholder account data see “risk factors—business risks—account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in part i item 1a fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as electronic commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt or the presence of the card or merchant agent is unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our rules and standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents key compliance programs include merchant audits for high fraud excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions and security compliance including our site data protection program which assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and 

  

subsequent account data compromises by requiring proper adherence to the payment card industry pci data security standards our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate 

our customers are responsible for fraud losses associated with both the cards they issue and their merchants from whom they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of mastercard cards we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help prevent fraud including mastercard securecode ®  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique personal code and our site data protection program in addition we offer several fraud detection and prevention solutions including our expert monitoring solutions a comprehensive suite of services designed to help our customers detect and prevent fraudulent activity generally we charge our customers fees for these antifraud programs and services 

enterprise risk management 

mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability 

we have an enterprise risk management “erm” program which is integrated with the business and designed to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of risk the erm program leverages our business processes to among other things ensure allocation of resources to appropriately address risk establishment of clear accountability for risk management and provision of transparency of risks to senior management the board of directors and appropriate board committees our erm program seeks to accomplish these goals by monitoring key risks providing an independent view of our risk profile and strengthening business operations by integrating erm principles and creating a more risk aware culture within mastercard mastercard’s integrated risk management structure balances risk and return by having business units own and manage risk centralized functions such as finance and law provide expertise and have responsibility for key risks our executive officers set policy and accountability and the board and committees provide oversight of the process 

intellectual property 

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard ®  maestro ® and cirrus ®  through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards contactless mobile electronic commerce security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations 

competition 

general mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased payment systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments as a result of a global trend electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment and card brands such as mastercard visa american express and discover are benefiting from this displacement however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume 

  

payment card processing and alternative competitors 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 litigation outcomes  ongoing litigation has affected and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry for example under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit in 2003 us merchants now have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states in addition as a result of the court’s decision in our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our former us competitive programs policy “cpp” our customers may now do business with american express or discover in the united states which could adversely affect our business in recent years these competitors have started working with issuing and acquiring financial institutions and thereby replicating certain aspects of endtoend payment networks a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank barclays hsbc usaa and ge money now issue american express andor discoverbranded cards see “risk factors—business risks—our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” in part i item 1a 

  

finally suits against us have been filed in several state and federal courts because of our currency conversion practices although we have settled these matters the settlements are still subject to appeal and could be overturned we cannot predict what the final outcome will be of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings for a description of these and other matters see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8

 government regulation 

general government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years in particular interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions including in the european union and hungary discussed below 

furthermore mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers examinations by the ffiec cover areas such as data integrity and data security in recent years the us federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures affecting credit card payment terms and requiring more conservative accounting greater risk management and in some cases higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders in addition mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk 

in addition aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue our customers in the united states are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers 

interchange interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions such challenges include regulatory proceedings in the european union by the european commission as well as such european union member states as hungary and elsewhere and regulatory inquiries in the united states and other jurisdictions interchange fees have also become the topic of increased legislative interest for example in the united states legislation has been introduced seeking to regulate interchange by allowing merchants to collectively seek to lower their payment card acceptance costs see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” in part i item 1a and in note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

data protection and information security in the united states during the past several years a number of bills have been considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues congress continues to consider these issues which could result 

  

in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers for example the house of representatives has again passed comprehensive data security and data breach notification legislation that could impose additional regulatory burdens on us and our customers similar legislation has not yet passed the senate in this congress and it is not clear whether legislation of this type will be signed into law in addition a large number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach in europe the european parliament and council passed the european directive 9546ec the “directive” on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject the directive establishes general principles with regard to the processing of personal data including the legal grounds for processing the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the european economic area and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data 

antimoney laundering mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352 of the usa patriot act which applies to certain types of financial institutions including operators of credit card systems section 352 of the usa patriot act requires mastercard to maintain a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and imposes similar requirements on some of our customers our antimoney laundering program must be reasonably designed to prevent our system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities the program must at a minimum include the designation of a compliance officer provide for the training of appropriate personnel regarding antimoney laundering responsibilities as well as incorporate policies procedures and controls to mitigate money laundering risks and be independently audited 

ofac and related regulations  we are also subject to regulations imposed by ofac ofac regulations impose restrictions on financial transactions with cuba burmamyanmar iran and sudan and with persons and entities included in ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” also cuba iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in these countries a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries mastercard takes measures to avoid transactions with persons and entities on the sdn list however it is possible that transactions involving persons or entities on the sdn list may be processed through our payment system it is possible that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions’ association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

issuer practice legislation and regulation the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system is in the process of implementing the credit card act which was signed into law in may 2009 the credit card act will have a significant impact on the disclosures made by our customers and on our customers’ account terms and business practices the credit card act and its implementing regulations will make it more difficult for credit card issuers to price credit cards for future credit risk and will have a significant effect on the pricing credit allocation and business models of most major credit card issuers the new law could reduce credit availability or increase the cost of credit to cardholders possibly affecting mastercard transaction volume and revenues 

  

the credit card act also includes provisions that impose limits and restrictions on certain prepaid or “pay before” card products including on fees the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system has proposed implementing regulations with respect to these provisions the statutory provisions and implementing regulations may diminish the attractiveness of these products to our customers and may consequently adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues 

the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system has also recently adopted regulations regulating overdraft fees imposed in connection with atm and debit card transactions these regulations will have the effect of significantly reducing overdraft fees our customers may charge in connection with debit card programs this may diminish the attractiveness of debit card programs to our customers and may adversely affect transaction volumes and revenues 

financial industry regulation  in june 2009 the administration of the president of the united states proposed legislative language to create a consumer financial protection agency the “cfpa” which could have significant authority to regulate consumer financial products including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products the house of representatives passed comprehensive financial regulatory reform legislation in december 2009 including provisions substantially similar to those originally introduced to create the cfpa under the housepassed legislation the cfpa’s proposed grant of authority is broad and not clearly defined it is therefore not clear whether the cfpa would be authorized to regulate aspects of payment card network operations the senate has not yet addressed this issue and it is therefore unclear what form any such legislation may ultimately take in addition in december 2009 the house financial services committee approved a bill that included provisions for the regulation of payment clearing and settlement systems determined by the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system to be “systemically important” that could impose upon such systems additional regulatory reporting examination or other obligations that may differ from existing legal requirements these provisions were not included in the financial reform bill adopted by the house of representatives in december 2009 and it is unclear whether congress might act with respect to such provisions either in another bill or on a “stand alone” basis and if so whether mastercard would be deemed “systematically important” however the imposition of any additional regulatory or other obligations on mastercard could result in costly new compliance burdens that could negatively impact our business 

regulation of internet transactions  in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is being implemented through a federal rulemaking process that was completed in december 2008 compliance will be required by june 1 2010 although congress may consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate internet gambling these federal rules will require us and our customers to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs andor decrease our transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth 

  

outside of the united states regulators in several countries outside of the united states have become increasingly interested in payment issues beyond interchange fees some of which have launched official proceedings into payment industry issues see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks 

interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations 

interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank the acquirer to the cardholder bank the issuer in connection with transactions initiated with our payment system’s cards interchange fees including our default interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense litigation regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries as well as merchants in the united states are seeking to reduce these fees through litigation regulatory action andor legislative action 

see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a detailed description of regulatory proceedings and inquiries into interchange fees examples of regulatory proceedings or inquiries into interchange fees include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 interchange fees andor related practices such as the “honor all cards” rule are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions including belgium brazil colombia czech republic estonia france israel mexico the netherlands switzerland turkey and venezuela we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a coordinated approach to interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions 

in addition to regulatory action merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees through litigation in the united states merchants have filed approximately 50 class action or individual suits alleging that mastercard’s interchange fees and acceptance rules violate federal antitrust laws these suits allege among other things that our purported setting of interchange fees constitutes horizontal pricefixing between and among mastercard and its member banks and mastercard visa and their member banks in violation of section 1 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade the suits seek treble damages attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings 

interchange fees also have been the topic of increased legislative interest for example 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees issuers may be unable to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers also could charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings litigation and legislative activity if we are less successful than visa in defending interchange fees we also could be competitively disadvantaged against visa if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees any such regulation legislation andor litigation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations in addition this could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

  

if the approval of the settlements of our currency conversion cases is undermined by an appeal and we are unsuccessful in any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we generate significant revenue from processing crossborder currency transactions for customers however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in july 2006 mastercard and other defendants in federal class actions related to these matters entered into agreements to settle or otherwise dispose of such matters pursuant to the settlement agreements mastercard has paid 72 million to be used for the defendants’ settlement fund to settle the federal actions and 13 million to settle state cases while the federal court has granted final approval of the settlement agreements the settlements are subject to appeals if an appeal is filed and we are unsuccessful in that appellate proceeding the settlement agreements will terminate if that occurs and we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits or the state currency conversion cases we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards in another country or may be required to modify our currency conversion practices see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

except as discussed in note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 we have not established reserves for any of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future we may determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any of our legal proceedings is required including charges related to legal fees in addition we may be required to record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of reserves that we have previously recorded such charges particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit in 2003 merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 these limitations and any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the payments industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volumes and revenues 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular many of our customers are subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently mastercard is at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has 

  

increased significantly in the last several years see “business—government regulation” in part i item 1 for a detailed description of such regulation and related legislation examples of such regulation and related legislation include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may result in costly compliance burdens andor may otherwise increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause such customers to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

  

government actions could curtail our ability to compete effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries such as russia and india have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card and processing providers to support them or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies our efforts to effect change in these countries may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs 

we and our customers are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we and our customers could be negatively impacted by these regulations for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and banking agency information safeguard requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguards rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue in the united states over the past several years a number of bills have been considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues congress continues to consider these issues which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers for example the united states house of representatives has again passed comprehensive data protection and information security legislation as well as data breach notification legislation which could impose additional regulatory burdens on us and our customers similar legislation has not yet passed in the us senate and it is not clear whether legislation of this type will be signed into law in addition a large number of states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

in the european union the european parliament and council have passed the european directive 9546ec on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data this directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject 

regulation of privacy and data protection and information security in these and other jurisdictions may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment cards which may decrease the number of our cards that they issue any additional regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations which could materially and adversely affect our profitability finally failure to comply with the privacy and data protection and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

  

business risks 

unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected and may continue to affect many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 continued to impact the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention in particular the economies of the united states and the united kingdom have continued to be significantly impacted by this economic turmoil and it is also impacting other economies around the world some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present as a result our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted or we may be impacted in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition our business is subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry for example see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a discussion of global interchange proceedings 

any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased systems including credit charge debit prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments see “business—competition” in part i item 1 within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa american express discover and jcb among others within the global general payment card industry visa has significantly greater volume than we do and has greater scale and market share as well as strong brand recognition which provides significant competitive advantages moreover some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have our ability to compete may also be affected by litigation outcomes see “business—competition” in part i item 1 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate endtoend payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without involving intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of endtoend payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of four party payments systems such as ours in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition these competitors have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of fourparty payments systems such as ours certain competitors may also hold competitive advantages as a result of their organizational structures see “business—competition” in part i item 1 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth as a result our revenue or profitability could decline we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems and payments in electronic commerce and for mobile devices a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we also expect that there may be other changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 

   

  

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

our strategy is to grow our business by among other things focusing on our customers and entering into customized business agreements with customers around the globe in the future we may not be able to enter into such agreements on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone substantial accelerated consolidation and we expect some consolidation to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat to us because our strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments recent consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the substantial loss of business for mastercard which could 

  

have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

the continued consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which mastercard has a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term if we lose a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest significant customers which could have a material adverse longterm impact on our business 

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2009 the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 14 billion or 28 of total revenue loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard for instance as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 19 obligations under litigation settlements and note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 in addition some large merchants are supporting many of the legal regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business financial condition and results of operations” the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

a decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as a significant portion of our revenue is generated from crossborder transactions 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from crossborder volume fees and transaction processing fees revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with 

  

crossborder travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency crossborder travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions these include the threat of terrorism and outbreaks of flu such as h1n1 viruses such as sars and other diseases any such decline in crossborder travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

certain customers have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain customers have exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customers with exclusive or nearlyexclusive relationships with our competitors such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from mastercard to the competitors with which they are principally aligned a significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our central processing systems because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payment system among regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

  

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the marketplace’s perception of our brands and reputation 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to our branded products depends highly upon the external perception of our company and industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory” moreover adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our business 

if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth 

in recent years industrywide offline and online debit transactions have grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions however in the united states transactions involving our brands account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low penetration in the united states we may not be able to increase our penetration for debit transactions in the united states since many of our competitors have longstanding and strong positions we may also be impacted adversely by the tendency among us consumers and merchants to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions in addition online pinbased transactions are more likely to be processed by other atmdebit pointofsale networks rather than by us any of these factors may inhibit the growth of our debit business which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and overall prospects for future growth 

general economic and global political conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our revenue and profitability 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic conditions such as unemployment and changes in interest rates and other political conditions such as devaluation of currencies and government restrictions on consumer spending in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands also as we are principally based in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business prospects and growth 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations 

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons if a principal member or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard international is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its 

  

merchant payment obligations our estimated mastercardbranded gross legal settlement exposure which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 26 billion as of december 31 2009 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 25 billion which by its terms will decrease to 20 billion in april 2010 for the final year of the facility which could be used to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers in the event that mastercard international effects a payment on behalf of a failed member mastercard international may seek an assignment of the underlying receivables from its members subject to approval by our board of directors such members may be charged for the amount of any settlement loss incurred during these ordinary course activities of mastercard while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by any of our largest customers on their peak day concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest customers or of several of our smaller customers may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition moreover during 2009 many of our financial institution customers were directly and adversely impacted by the unprecedented events that occurred in the financial markets and the economic turmoil that ensued around the world these events present increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees for more information on our settlement exposure as of december 31 2009 see note 22 settlement and travelers cheque risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions as a result of process or other technology malfunction fire natural or manmade disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism accident or other catastrophic events a disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services our visibility in the global payments industry may also attract terrorists and hackers to attack our facilities or systems leading to service interruptions increased costs or data security compromises additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue 

we our customers and other third parties store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards bearing our brands in addition our customers may sponsor thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands damage the reputation of our brands and lead to claims against us in recent years there have been several highprofile account data compromise events involving merchants and third party payment processors that process store or transmit payment card data which affected millions of mastercard visa discover and american express cardholders as a result of such data security breaches we may be subject to lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands while most of these lawsuits do not involve direct claims against us in certain circumstances we could be exposed to damage claims which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition any damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes revenue and future growth prospects or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

  

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeit or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance adoption of new technologies or enhanced security requirements and damage to our reputation and financial damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which could reduce our revenue and income or limit our future growth 

the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes or by intellectual property rights of third parties we have received and we may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies suggesting that we may be infringing a preexisting patent or that we need to license use of their patents to avoid infringement such notices may among other things threaten litigation against us our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our operations outside of the united states 

during 2009 approximately 545 of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluations of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

any acquisitions or strategic investments that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may evaluate or make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies anticipate continuing to make these evaluations and have made certain recent acquisitions including interests in joint ventures and other alliances we have no present understandings commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions if we do make such an acquisition however we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a 

  

result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition furthermore we may not be able to successfully integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies in particular the integration of any acquisition including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue in addition to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders 

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure 

future sales of our shares of class a common stock could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future as of february 11 2010 we had 110441542 outstanding shares of class a common stock of which 13496933 shares were owned by the mastercard foundation the “foundation” under the terms of the donation the foundation may sell its shares of our class a common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements under canadian tax law the foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 35 of its assets not used in administration of the foundation in qualified charitable disbursements however the foundation has obtained permission from the canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to ten years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the tenyear period despite this permission to defer annual disbursements the foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year in addition the foundation will be permitted to sell all of the remaining shares held by it starting twenty years and eleven months after the consummation of the ipo 

in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that holders of our class b common stock would be eligible through “conversion transactions” in amounts and at times to be designated by the company to convert their shares of class b common stock into shares of our class a common stock on a oneforone basis for subsequent transfer or sale to an eligible holder subject to annual aggregate amounts and other limits the company has completed four such voluntary conversion programs including one program in 2009 after may 31 2010 holders of our class b common stock will have the option to convert all of their shares of class b common stock into shares of class a common stock on a oneforone basis for subsequent sale to the public without aggregate amounts or similar limitations all of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares will be freely tradable without restriction or registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended by persons other than our affiliates these future sales or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations and have experienced increased volatility in connection with recent unpredictable economic events around the world this market volatility as well as the factors listed below among others could affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 there are terms in our charter documents and under delaware law that could be considered antitakeover provisions or could have an impact on a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock the class b common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further no member or former member of mastercard international or any operator member or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

the foundation owns 13496933 shares of class a common stock representing as of february 11 2010 approximately 12 of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to the date which is twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements starting on the fourth anniversary of the ipo the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our members the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders 

the holders of our class m common stock have the right to elect up to three of our directors and to approve significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of our other stockholders

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit debit and related payment programs of approximately 23000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers we develop and market payment solutions process payment transactions and provide support services to our customers and depending upon the service to merchants and other clients we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic™ maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our customers as part of managing these brands we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

we recorded net income of 15 billion or 1116 per diluted share in 2009 versus a net loss of 254 million or 194 per diluted share in 2008 and net income of 11 billion or 796 per diluted share in 2007 as of december 31 2009 our liquidity and capital positions remained strong with 29 billion in cash and cash equivalents and current availableforsale securities and 35 billion in equity in addition we generated cash flows from operations of 14 billion in the year ended december 31 2009 

our net revenues increased 21 in 2009 primarily due to increased transactions pricing changes and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands partially offset by approximately 18 percentage points relating to the us dollar average exchange rates strengthening versus the euro and brazilian real average exchange rates historically we experienced greater growth in net revenues than the revenue growth in 2009 revenue growth in 2008 was 227 

our lower revenue growth rate primarily reflects the impact of the present global economic environment which is negatively affecting our customers and their cardholders our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending changes in cardholder spending behavior influenced in 2009 by recessionary environments and rising unemployment have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to grow our revenues our revenues are primarily based on volumes and transactions our volumes are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction during 2009 our processed transactions increased 69 however our volumes only increased 14 on a local currency converted basis and therefore the average amount per transaction declined in 2009 volumebased revenues domestic assessments and crossborder volume fees decreased compared to 2008 and transactionbased revenues transaction processing fees increased in 2009 during 2008 our processed transactions increased 117 and volumes on a local currency basis increased 109 

during 2009 net pricing actions contributed approximately 6 percentage points to our net revenue growth these net pricing actions included price increases in april 2009 and october 2009 partially offset by an increase in crossborder rebates and the repeal of pricing relating to our interim arrangement with the european commission overall revenue growth was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity and an increase to crossborder rebates to encourage certain behaviors of customers rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 241 227 and 246 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our operating expenses decreased 486 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower litigation settlements excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in “—operating expenses” operating expenses declined 69 in 2009 compared to 2008 in 2009 we realigned our resources and implemented contingency plans in response to the current global economic and business 

  

environment general and administrative expenses decreased 31 in 2009 due to lower expenses for professional fees and travel partially offset by increased personnel expenses as a result of severance costs incurred related to the realignment of our resources advertising and marketing expenses declined 192 in 2009 due to reduced spending on sponsorship and promotional activities reflecting cost management initiatives and market realities 

our ratios of operating income loss as a percentage of net revenues or operating margins were 443 in 2009 versus 107 in 2008 and 272 in 2007 excluding the impact of special items our operating margins were 445 in 2009 versus 390 in 2008 and 273 in 2007 

other income expense varies depending on activities not core to our operations in 2009 we did not have significant activity comparable to gains realized in 2008 and 2007 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as payment card transactions creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term see “—business environment” for a discussion of environmental considerations related to our longterm strategic objectives 

business environment 

we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies revenue generated in the united states was approximately 455 472 and 497 of total revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period but differences in market maturity economic health price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business unprecedented events which began during 2008 continued to impact the financial markets around the world including continued distress in the credit environment continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention in particular the economies of the united states and the united kingdom have continued to be significantly impacted by this economic turmoil and it is also impacting other economies around the world some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential changes in laws and regulations many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 

mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present as a result our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted or the company may be impacted in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our business is subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry for example see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for a discussion of global interchange proceedings 

our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as premiumaffluent quickservicelow value commercialsmall business debit prepaid and issuer and acquirer processor services pursuing domestic processing opportunities throughout the world enhancing our merchant relationships expanding points of acceptance for our brands seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world we are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated and dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing and consulting and information services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the long term we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time 

  

financial results 

as part of a review of its presentation of certain financial information during 2009 the company 1 modified its presentation of details of the company’s major revenue categories included within the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the “mda” section of filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” and 2 reclassified certain cardholderrelated enhancement expenses in each case the company’s intent was to better align such information with the way in which management views the underlying drivers of the business and analyzes the company’s results of operations the modifications to the presentation within the mda of the detail of the company’s revenue categories did not result in any changes to the company’s historical financial statements and had no effect on the overall calculation of net revenue presented in the financial statements the reclassification of certain cardholderrelated enhancement expenses did not result in any impact to the company’s overall operating expenses see “—operating expenses” for more information 

our operating results for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are as follows 

 

  

   

    

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar for 2009 as compared to 2008 the us dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and brazilian real which resulted in lower revenues and expenses for 2008 as compared to 2007 the us dollar weakened against the euro and brazilian real which increased revenues and expenses 

in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our domestic assessments crossborder volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv on a local currency basis in 2009 and 2008 gdv on a us dollar converted basis declined 33 and increased 116 respectively versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 14 and 109 respectively 

revenues 

revenue descriptions 

mastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders merchants issuers the cardholders’ banks and acquirers the merchants’ banks our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other paymentrelated services we provide to our customers our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar euro and brazilian real 

we process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system providing cardholders with the ability to utilize and merchants to accept mastercard cards across multiple country borders we process most of the crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states united kingdom canada brazil and australia 

our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers a combination of the following factors determines the pricing 

 

  

  

  

  

   

crossborder transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions since crossborder fees are higher than domestic fees we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 

the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 rebates and incentives contrarevenue rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contrarevenue in the same period that performance occurs performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive including commitments to the agreement term hurdles for volumes transactions or issuance of new cards and the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements 

revenue analysis 

in 2009 and 2008 gross revenues grew 40 and 198 respectively revenue growth in 2009 was primarily due to changes in pricing increased transactions and increases in the volume of activity on cards carrying our brands partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts the revenue growth in 2008 was the result of increased transactions and gdv as well as price increases and currency fluctuation rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 241 227 and 246 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our net revenues in 2009 and 2008 increased 21 and 227 versus 2008 and 2007 respectively 

pricing changes increased net revenues by approximately 6 percentage points in 2009 the price increases primarily related to increases to transaction processing fees in april 2009 and crossborder volume fees in october 2009 the net price change include approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to an increase in crossborder rebates to encourage certain behaviors of customers and approximately 1 percentage point decrease relating to the october 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of june 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the european commission see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more information 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2009 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 14 billion or 28 of total net revenues the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a 

  

the significant components of our revenues were as follows 

 

  

 domestic assessments— there was a decrease in domestic assessments of 02 in 2009 as compared to a 137 increase in 2008 these variances were due to 

 

  

 the decrease in 2009 was partially offset by pricing changes implemented in april 2009 and october 2008 these price changes favorably impacted domestic assessments in 2009 by approximately 4 percentage points of which approximately 1 percentage point was associated with certain october 2008 pricing changes which were repealed at the end of june 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the european commission see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more information 

crossborder volume fees— there was a decrease in crossborder volume fees of 25 in 2009 as compared to a 311 increase in 2008 these variances were due to 

 

  

 the decrease in 2009 was partially offset by approximately 7 percentage points relating to pricing changes during 2009 the crossborder pricing actions also included an increase to crossborder rebates as discussed in the rebates and incentives discussion below in addition approximately 1 percentage point of the 7 percentage point pricing increase was associated with certain pricing changes implemented in october 2008 and repealed at the end of june 2009 as part of our interim arrangement with the european commission see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for more information the increase in 2008 included approximately 21 percentage points of pricing changes related to acquiring crossborder volumes 

  

transaction processing fees —the increases in transaction processing fees of 149 and 193 during 2009 and 2008 respectively were due to 

 

  

  

 other revenues —the increases in 2009 and 2008 of 44 and 207 respectively were offset by approximately 1 percentage point and contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the increase respectively for the impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of other revenues from our functional currencies to us dollars additionally 

 

  

 rebates and incentives —rebates and incentives increased 101 in 2009 and 110 in 2008 rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 241 227 and 246 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the amount of rebates and incentives increased due to the following 

 

  

  

 these increases were partially offset by 

 

  

 operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing litigation settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses during 2009 the company reclassified certain cardholderrelated enhancement expenses which were previously classified as advertising and marketing expenses to general and administrative expenses these cardholder benefit programs such as insurance and card replacements were previously deemed promotional features of the cards and over time have become standard product offerings in certain card categories approximately 83 million and 79 million of these expenses have been reclassified in 2008 and 2007 respectively to conform to the 2009 presentation 

  

operating expenses decreased approximately 27 billion and increased 26 billion in 2009 and 2008 respectively these changes in operating expenses are primarily due to the settlements of lawsuits in 2008 in addition in 2009 we initiated resource realignment programs which increased personnel costs due to severancerelated expenses and implemented contingency plans which reduced certain other operating expenses the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses excluding litigation settlements “special items” which is a nongaap financial measure to the operating expenses including litigation settlements which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement management believes this analysis may be helpful in evaluating ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods 

 

  

  

    

general and administrative 

the major components of general and administrative expenses are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 advertising and marketing 

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness preference and usage through integrated advertising sponsorship promotional interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale we will also continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences 

  

advertising and marketing expenses decreased 179 million and 67 million or 192 and 67 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decreases in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to cost management initiatives and market realities additionally the impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of amounts from our functional currencies to us dollars contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the decrease in 2009 and offset approximately 2 percentage points of the decrease in 2008 in 2008 and 2007 our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships and the timing of certain advertising and marketing expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions during 2007 we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 world cup soccer events see note 25 other income to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for further discussion of this settlement agreement 

litigation settlements 

expense for litigation settlements was 7 million 25 billion and 3 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively see note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for information on litigation settlements 

in 2008 mastercard and visa inc “visa” entered into a settlement agreement with discover the “discover settlement” relating to the us federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties the discover settlement ended all litigation among the parties for a total of 28 billion previously mastercard and visa entered into a judgment sharing agreement in accordance with the terms of the judgment sharing agreement mastercard’s share of the discover settlement was 863 million which was paid to discover in november 2008 additionally in connection with the discover settlement morgan stanley discover’s former parent company paid mastercard 35 million in november 2008 pursuant to a separate agreement the net pretax expense of 828 million was recorded in litigation settlements in 2008 

also in 2008 mastercard entered into a settlement agreement with american express which ended all existing litigation between american express and mastercard the “american express settlement” under the terms of the american express settlement beginning on september 15 2008 mastercard is required to pay american express up to 150 million each quarter for 12 quarters payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter for a maximum amount of 18 billion the charge is based on mastercard’s assumption that american express will achieve certain financial performance hurdles the quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15 of american express’ united states global network services billings during the quarter up to a maximum of 150 million per quarter if however the payment for any quarter is less than 150 million the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between 150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall mastercard recorded the present value of 18 billion at a 575 discount rate or 16 billion pretax in 2008 

in 2003 mastercard entered into a settlement agreement the “us merchant lawsuit settlement” related to the us merchant lawsuit described under the caption “us merchant and consumer litigations” in note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and recorded a pretax charge of 721 million consisting of i the monetary amount of the us merchant lawsuit settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant lawsuit settlement and iii costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit the 721 million pretax charge amount was an estimate which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors on july 1 2009 mastercard entered into an agreement the “prepayment agreement” with plaintiffs of the us merchant lawsuit settlement whereby mastercard agreed to make a prepayment of its remaining 400 million in payment obligations at a discounted amount of 335 million the company paid 335 million on september 30 2009 in accordance with the prepayment agreement 

  

we recorded liabilities for these and certain other litigation settlements in 2009 and prior years total liabilities for litigation settlements changed from december 31 2007 as follows 

 

  

 depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 29 million and 14 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the increases in depreciation and amortization expense were primarily due to increased investments in data center equipment capitalized software and leasehold and building improvements additionally in 2009 the increase included depreciation on the company’s global technology and operations center which was acquired under a capital lease arrangement we expect that depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as we continue to invest in property plant and equipment and capitalized software 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense and other gains and losses the components of other income expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were as shown below 

 

  

   

  

  

 income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 was 341 337 and 350 respectively the primary cause of the changes in the effective rates was due to the litigation settlement charges recorded in 2008 which resulted in a pretax loss in a higher tax jurisdiction and pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions in addition deferred tax assets were remeasured and reduced by 15 million and 21 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively due to changes in our state effective tax rate as a result of the remeasurements our income tax expense was increased for the same amounts 

the components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 are as follows 

 

  

   

the company’s gaap effective income tax rate for 2008 was significantly affected by the tax benefits related to the charges for the discover settlement and the american express settlement due to the nonrecurring nature of these items the company believes that the calculation of the 2008 effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the discover settlement and the american express settlement will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

  

  

  during 2009 the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods decreased by 17 million the decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for 2009 is primarily due to changes in judgment related to prior year tax positions as well as from the effective settlement of examinations with the irs as of december 31 2009 the company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior periods was 146 million all of which would reduce the company’s effective tax rate if recognized 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service our obligations related to litigation settlements at december 31 2009 and 2008 we had 29 billion and 21 billion respectively of cash and cash equivalents and current availableforsale securities to use for our operations our equity was 35 billion and 19 billion as of december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively we believe that the cash generated from operations our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital needs and litigation settlement obligations our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are still a party see “risk factorslegal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a note 19 obligations under litigation settlements and note 21 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 and “—business environment” in part ii item 7 for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2009 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents 

 

  

       seasonality 

the changes in the global economic environment during 2009 and 2008 impacted our historical trends experienced during the fourth quarter each year which have included increased revenues and expenses related to end of the year activities our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending our lower revenue growth rates began in the fourth quarter 2008 and continued during 2009 and are primarily due to lower growth rates in purchase volumes and transactions than in the past in addition mastercard implemented resource realignment and cost savings initiatives with particular focus on personnel travel expenditures and advertising during 2009 and 2008 as our business and the economic environment continue to evolve we expect new trends to emerge 

  

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

 

   

   

   

recent accounting pronouncements 

transfers of financial assets —in june 2009 the accounting standard for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was amended the change eliminates the qualifying special purpose entity concept establishes a new unit of account definition that must be met for the transfer of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting clarifies and changes the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale changes the amount of gain or loss on a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor and requires additional new disclosures the company will adopt the new standard upon its effective date of january 1 2010 and does not expect the impact of the adoption to be material to the company’s financial position or results of operations 

variable interest entities —in june 2009 there was a revision to the accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities the revision eliminates the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities requires a new qualitative approach for determining whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity and changes the requirement of when to reassess whether a reporting entity should consolidate a variable interest entity during february 2010 the scope of the revised standard was modified to indefinitely exclude certain entities from the requirement to be assessed for consolidation the standard is effective beginning on january 1 2010 and the company does not expect the impact of the adoption to be material to the company’s financial position or results of operations 

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables— in september 2009 the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended current accounting standards require companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by the company itself or other vendors the new accounting standard eliminates i the residual method of revenue allocation and ii the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered the company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective january 1 2011 via prospective adoption the company is currently evaluating the requirements of the standard to determine the impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

improving fair value disclosures —in january 2010 fair value disclosure requirements were amended and will require incremental disclosures about instruments within the valuation categories used in the fair value measurements the company will adopt the guidance during 2010 and 2011 as required and the adoption will have no impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies which have been approved by the board of directors governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there were no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2009 as compared to december 31 2008 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is 

  

to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months 

 

  

 our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of 16 other transaction currencies the remaining 136 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as availableforsale investments with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the company’s available for sale investments as of december 31 was as follows

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit debit and related payment programs of over 24000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers through our threetiered business model as franchisor processor and advisor we develop and market payment solutions process payment transactions and provide support services to our customers and depending upon the service to merchants and other clients we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic™ maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our customers as part of managing these brands we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments 

a typical transaction processed over our network involves four parties in addition to us the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholder’s bank and the acquirer the merchant’s bank consequently the payment network we operate is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system our customers are the financial institutions and other entities that act as issuers and acquirers using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient quick and secure payment method that is accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customer financial institutions to ensure the integrity of our payment network in addition we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands however cardholder and merchant transaction relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or 

  

other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

our business has a global reach and has continued to experience growth gross dollar volume “gdv” on cards carrying the mastercard brand as reported by our customers was approximately 25 trillion in 2008 an 115 increase in us dollar terms and a 107 increase in local currency terms over the gdv reported in 2007 in 2008 we processed 210 billion transactions an 118 increase over the number of transactions processed in 2007 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as card payment transactions creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as premiumaffluent and contactless cards commercial payments debit prepaid and issuer processor and terminal driving services enhancing our merchant relationships expanding points of acceptance for our brands seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world we are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing and consulting and information services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the long term we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time 

we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment in recent years we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny and other legal challenges particularly with respect to interchange fees interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers have been the subject of increased regulatory and legislative scrutiny and litigation as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers we do not earn revenues from interchange fees however if issuers were unable to collect interchange fees or were to receive reduced interchange fees we may experience a reduction in the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system such as ours andor a reduction in the rate of number of cards issued as well as lower overall transaction volumes proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment may also become more attractive issuers might also decide to charge higher fees to cardholders thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability they also may attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge in addition to those challenges relating to interchange fees we are also exposed to a variety of significant lawsuits and regulatory actions including federal antitrust claims and claims under state unfair competition statutes see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in item 1a of this report 

mastercard incorporated was incorporated as a delaware stock corporation in may 2001 we conduct our business principally through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” a delaware membership corporation that was formed in november 1966 our financial institution customers are generally either principal members of mastercard international which participate directly in mastercard international’s business or affiliate members of mastercard international which participate indirectly in mastercard international’s business through a principal member in may 2006 we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure for mastercard incorporated which we refer to as the “ownership and governance transactions” and which included the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors who are independent from our financial institution customers and the establishment of a charitable foundation incorporated in canada the mastercard foundation the “foundation” part of the ownership and governance transactions included an initial public offering of a new class of common stock the “ipo” in may 2006 prior to our change in governance and ownership structure 

  

the common stock of mastercard incorporated was owned by principal members of mastercard international for more information about our capital structure voting rights of our common stock repurchases of our class a common stock and conversions of shares of our class b common stock into shares of our voting class a common stock see note 14 stockholders’ equity to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

our industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

 

  

  

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 

  

  

 the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard maestro visa ®  american express ®  jcb ®  diners club ® and discover ®  historically these brands—including mastercard—were principally associated with “pay later” credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets today mastercard and visa cards may be issued in any of the “pay later” “pay now” or “pay before” categories 

“pay now” cards may be further categorized into several subsegments 

 

  

  

 regional and domesticlocal pinbased debit brands are the primary brands in many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and other brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions 

  

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a significant portion of all cardbased forms of payment typically private label cards are “pay later” cards issued by or on behalf of a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at the issuing merchant’s locations 

payment services 

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services to our financial institution customers in connection with these services we deploy dedicated customer relationship management teams to our customers to provide them with customized solutions built upon our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing and consulting and information services 

we generate revenues from the fees we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services we also earn revenues by charging our customers assessments based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards carrying our brands 

transaction processing 

introduction we operate the mastercard worldwide network which links issuers and acquirers around the globe for transaction processing services and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards at millions of merchants worldwide a typical transaction processed over our network involves four participants in addition to us issuer the cardholder’s bank acquirer the merchant’s bank merchant and cardholder the following diagram depicts a typical pointofsale card transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder a purchases goods or services from a merchant b using a card after the transaction is authorized by the issuer d using our network the acquirer c pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount to the merchant this discount which we refer to as the merchant discount takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee described below the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus any interchange fee and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account our rules generally guarantee the payment of transactions using mastercardbranded cards and certain transactions using cirrus and maestrobranded cards between issuers and acquirers 

in this fourparty payment system the economics of a payment transaction relative to mastercard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over our network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

  

a significant portion of the merchant discount is generally paid from the acquirer to the issuer or netted by the issuer against amounts paid to the acquirer in the form of an interchange fee the balance of the merchant discount is retained by the acquirer to cover its costs and profit margin acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers transactionbased and related fees and assessments for the services we provide them 

interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and passed to issuers or netted by issuers against amounts paid to acquirers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers we establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other interchange fee arrangements in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process however we do not earn revenues from them as noted above interchange fees are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards and are currently subject to regulatory legislative andor legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in item 1a of this report 

mastercard worldwide network  we facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of the transactions described above and similar transactions through the mastercard worldwide network our proprietary global telecommunications network among the platforms and systems encompassed in the mastercard worldwide network are the global clearing management system “gcms” the mastercard single message system the “single message system” also known as the mastercard debit switch “mds” the mastercard dual message system the “dual message system” formerly known as banknet and settlement systems the mastercard worldwide network provides an intelligent architecture that combines both centralized and peertopeer distributed transaction processing this infrastructure is designed to automatically adapt to the individual needs of each transaction blending the speed and redundancy of peertopeer networking with the realtime availability of valueadded services provided from a central site we believe our network is unique providing distinct advantages over networks deployed by our competitors and enabling us to provide our customers around the world with quality scalable transaction processing that is consistently reliable secure and available 

types of transactions generally the mastercard worldwide network processes three types of transactions credit transactions debit transactions that require the cardholder’s signature which are referred to as offline debit transactions and debit transactions that require the cardholder to use a pin or personal identification number for verification which are referred to as online debit transactions in addition some payment cards are equipped with an rfid radio frequency identification microchip which provides an advanced authentification technique and mastercard paypass ® described below which allows contactless payments requiring neither signature nor pin 

authorization clearing and settlement authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is approved by the issuer or in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions for credit and offline debit transactions the dual message system provides for the transmission of authorization requests and results among issuers acquirers and other transaction processors or networks for online debit transactions the single message system or mds switches financial messages and provides transaction and settlement reporting our rules which may vary across regions establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 

  

clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems credit and offline debit transactions using mastercardbranded cards are generally cleared via centralized processing through gcms and the related information is typically routed among customers via the mastercard worldwide network gcms has helped us to improve our timetomarket in introducing new programs and services more importantly using gcms we can partner with our customers to provide valueadded services to merchants and cardholders for example issuers can use gcms to develop marketing promotions for segments of their card portfolios without investing in their own systems development we believe that gcms and our other recent system enhancements position us well to pursue incremental processing opportunities for online debit transactions the single message system or mds performs clearing between customers and other debit transaction processing networks since 2004 mastercard has worked with issuers and acquirers to increase the routing priority of our systems for the processing of pin pointofsale transactions and has begun to establish direct processing connections to major us merchants 

once transactions have been authorized and cleared mastercard provides services in connection with the settlement of the transactions—that is the exchange of funds along with associated fees settlement for credit offline debit and online debit transactions is provided through the mastercard worldwide network once clearing is completed a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position the actual exchange of funds takes place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer and approved by mastercard and a settlement bank chosen by mastercard customer settlement occurs in us dollars or in a limited number of other currencies in accordance with our established rules 

mastercard integrated processing solutions ips in april 2008 we introduced mastercard integrated processing solutions “ips” a mastercardengineered debit processing platform ips is designed to provide an issuing financial institution with a complete processing solution to help create differentiated products and services and allow quick deployment of payments portfolios across banking channels through a single connection the ips platform is designed to provide customers with an integrated suite of branded debit network and card issuer processing services in support of pinbased and signature debit payments prepaid payment cards and atm driving as well as realtime card management and backoffice processing services the proprietary mastercard portfolio viewer feature of ips a userfriendly customer interface can deliver aggregate cardholder intelligence across accounts and product lines providing issuers a view of information that can help them customize their products and programs in 2008 we announced our first customer to implement ips for complete branded debit network and issuer processing we also announced in 2008 the first financial institution to take advantage of the global prepaid transaction processing capabilities of ips we continue to develop opportunities to further enhance our ips offerings 

regional transaction processing we provide transaction processing authorization clearing and settlement services for customers in our europe region through our subsidiary mastercard europe sprl “mastercard europe” these services allow european customers to facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout europe recently we substantially completed a multiyear technical convergence project to integrate our european systems into our global processing systems in australia we operate a processing facility that manages a majority of mastercardbranded transaction volumes for australia and new zealand 

outside of the united states and a select number of other countries most intracountry as opposed to crossborder transaction activity conducted with mastercard maestro and cirrus cards is authorized cleared andor settled by our customers or other processors without the involvement of our central processing systems we do not earn transaction processing fees for such activity accordingly we derive a significant portion of our nonus revenues from processing crossborder transactions as part of our strategy we are developing and promoting domestic processing solutions such as ips for our customers that are designed to capitalize on our significant investments the mastercard worldwide network 

  

operations and business continuity  our transaction processing services are managed principally through our global technology and operations headquarters in o’fallon missouri our headquarters is a stateoftheart worldwide network control facility with over 50000 square feet of white computer room environment our core processing network has the capacity to handle 140 million transactions per hour with an average response time of 140 milliseconds we typically operate at about 80 capacity and we can substantially scale capacity to meet demand the o’fallon facility also houses the mastercard data warehouse mastercard processes transactions for approximately 24000 financial institutions in more than 160 currencies from approximately 210 countries and territories 

our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year our processing systems are built with redundancy and automatic backup procedures to ensure continued operation in the event of a service interruption we have consistently maintained availability of our core global processing systems in excess of 999 should our o’ fallon facility be disabled our coprocessing facility in kansas city missouri would continue operations 

gross dollar volume gdv 

the table below provides some information regarding gdv which is one of the key drivers of our revenue as it forms the basis of volumebased assessments the mastercardbranded gdv table below provides information regarding the gdv for all mastercardbranded cards excluding cirrus and maestro and for both mastercard credit and charge card programs and mastercard debit programs in the united states and in all of our regions other than the united states for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 growth rates are provided on both a us dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated gdv represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with mastercardbranded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks 

 

  

    

  mastercard revenue sources mastercard generates revenues by charging transaction processing and related fees and gdvbased and cardbased assessments to both issuers and acquirers we generally process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states the united kingdom canada brazil and australia and we process substantially all crossborder transactions related to mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards the allocation of our revenues varies among issuers and acquirers across our regions typical transactionbased fees include those associated with authorization clearing and settlement and other valueadded network products we also charge crossborder and currency conversion fees and other fees such as those associated with acceptance development fees cardholder services compliance penalties holograms and userpay fees for a variety of account and transaction enhancement services and manuals and publications assessments are primarily based on a customer’s gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the nature of the transactions that generate gdv and by region rebates and incentives which are paid to customers and merchants to encourage issuance usage and acceptance of our cards are recorded as contrarevenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—revenues” in item 7 of this report 

our gross revenues from transactions cross border and currency conversion fees assessments and other fees vary by region and are dependent on the nature of the transactions and gdv generated from those transactions pricing is determined based on the combination of transaction characteristics including whether the transaction is domestic or crossborder credit online debit offline debit tiered pricing geographic region or country retail purchase or cash withdrawal crossborder transactions generate greater revenue than domestic transactions due to higher fees for settlement authorization and switch and are also subject to crossborder and currency conversion fees in addition higher fees are charged on credit and offline debit transactions than on online debit transactions 

on a global scale we have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies for example we may process a transaction in a merchant’s local currency however the charge for the transaction would appear on the cardholder’s statement in the cardholder’s home currency mastercard generally uses a wholesale rate increased by a certain percentage or a governmentmandated rate to convert transactions in other currencies into us dollars revenues from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions fluctuate with crossborder travel see “risk factors—business risks—a significant portion of the revenue we earn outside the united states is generated from crossborder transactions and a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability” in item 1a of this report

marketing 

we manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through brand advertising promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives in 2006 we adopted a new corporate brand mastercard worldwide to reflect our threetiered business model as franchisor processor and advisor and a new corporate vision statement the heart of commerce™ to represent our strategic vision of advancing commerce globally our marketing activities combine advertising sponsorships promotions customer marketing interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated program designed to increase consumer awareness of mastercard and usage of mastercard cards we also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by customizing them in individual countries while maintaining a common global theme our initiatives are designed to build the value of the mastercard brand 

our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility usage and loyalty among cardholders globally our awardwinning “priceless ® ” advertising campaign has run in 51 languages in 110 countries the “priceless” campaign promotes mastercard acceptance and usage benefits that permit cardholders to pay for what they need when they need it it also provides mastercard with a consistent recognizable message that supports our brand positioning in order to promote usage of our cards we conduct frequent promotions on a regional and national basis often in conjunction with merchants or our customers to engage consumers directly and advance our presence in new digital media we launched pricelesscom in the united states in 2006 and we continue to roll out the website in key markets pricelesscom is one of mastercard’s websites which allow consumers to engage directly in brand programs promotions and merchant offers and provides relevant information on mastercard cards and services 

we also seek to drive business for our customers by sponsoring a variety of sporting and entertainment properties in particular mastercard has a significant presence in sports which we believe has broad appeal among consumers we have worldwide partnerships with wellregarded golf events such as the senior british open the arnold palmer invitational and both the pga tour and european tour which are intended to help create business building opportunities among a more affluent demographic we have a longstanding relationship with international soccer and have continued this relationship by sponsoring leading events including the union of european football associations “uefa” european championship and the uefa champions league in europe as well as the south american qualifiers mastercard is also the exclusive payments sponsor to major league baseball and the majority of its professional teams we also sponsor a number of individual national football league teams in professional tennis mastercard made its debut in 2008 as a sponsor of the australian open one of the four grand slam tournaments and continued this sponsorship in 2009 one of our most recent sponsorship alliances is in the sport of rugby in which mastercard in 2008 became a worldwide partner of the international rugby board irb world cup 2011 

we seek to sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences including a sponsorship platform in fashion originally launched in our asia pacific region with the intention of raising our brand awareness with affluent consumers we also target a broad audience by providing access to music artists and live performances through wellknown entertainment properties such as jazz at lincoln center in new york soundstage and the brit awards in 2008 mastercard also added the grammy awards to its roster of entertainment sponsorships 

  

acceptance initiatives 

we estimate that as of december 31 2008 cards carrying the mastercard brand were accepted at more than 285 million acceptance locations including 15 million atms as well as other locations where cash may be obtained information on atm and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publiclyavailable reports of payment industry associations government agencies and independent market analysts in canada and the united states cards bearing the maestro brand mark are accepted at many of these same locations 

merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard large merchants are supporting many of the legal legislative and regulatory challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” and “risk factors—business risks—merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in item 1a of this report we may be required to increase the amount and scope of incentives that we provide to merchants to encourage the acceptance and usage of our cards which may adversely affect our business nevertheless we believe many opportunities exist to enhance our relationships with merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards in 2004 we made available directly to merchants our rules that apply to card acceptance and related activities thereby increasing the level of transparency and predictability of our payment system for merchants in 2006 we published the interchange rates applicable to merchants in the united states and in 2007 we introduced a cap on interchange fees on fuel purchases at petroleum retailers in 2008 we published our entire set of operating rules on our website as an additional example we have an advisory group which brings together merchants acquirers issuers and processors twice a year to examine payments innovation at the point of interaction and to seek to enhance the experience for merchants and consumers at the point of sale or in an online shopping environment for a retail sales transaction furthermore we also hold meetings with merchant advisory groups that have been established in key global markets including the united states canada south africa and australia and we continue to strengthen our acquirer and merchant sales teams around the world 

we seek to maintain unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded programs by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the categories of merchants that accept cards carrying our brands we are focused on expanding acceptance in electronic and mobile commerce environments in fast throughput businesses such as fast food restaurants in transportation and in public sector payments such as those involving taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories second we seek to increase the number of payment channels in which mastercard programs are accepted such as by introducing mastercard acceptance in connection with bill payment applications we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make bill payments in a variety of categories—including rent utilities and insurance—with their mastercardbranded cards third we seek to increase usage of our programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis we also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of mastercardbranded programs or indicate a preference for mastercardbranded programs when accepting payments from consumers 

we also support technical initiatives designed to make mastercard card acceptance more attractive for specific merchants such as our quick payment service for fast food restaurants and other merchants where rapid transactions are required in addition mastercard paypass appeals to merchants in fast throughput businesses because it reduces transaction times 

  

in addition we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner is typically a charity educational or other nonprofit organization 

membership standards 

we establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding membership in mastercard international and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and enforcement 

membership in mastercard international and its affiliates is generally open to banks and other regulated and supervised financial institutions applicants for membership must generally meet specified membership eligibility requirements 

in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to perform all obligations required of members licenses provide members with certain rights including access to the network and usage of our brands antimoney laundering due diligence reviews and customer risk management reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission as well as on existing members all applicants and members must meet the requirements of mastercard’s antimoney laundering program and mastercard can block authorization of transactions and ultimately terminate membership for noncompliance with the program as a condition of our licenses members agree to comply with our bylaws policies rules and operating regulations the “standards” mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce the standards which relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement and member failures to help ensure that members conform to the standards we review card programs proposed by members 

customer risk management 

as a guarantor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2400 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 3200 affiliate debit licensees our estimated gross settlement risk exposure for mastercardbranded transactions which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 24 billion as of december 31 2008 principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members approximately 21300 

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor the financial health economic and political operating environments of and compliance with our rules and standards by our principal members affiliate debit licensees and other entities to which we grant licenses if the financial condition of a member or the state of the economy in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or other mastercard members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of standby letters of credit and bank guarantees as of december 31 2008 we had members who had posted approximately 2 billion in collateral held for settlement exposure for mastercardbranded transactions if a member becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other members we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to our members or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership however to date mastercard has never terminated a member 

  

due to the member’s risk profile in addition to these measures we have also established a 25 billion committed credit facility for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure see “risk factors—business risks—as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal member and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations” in item 1a of this report see also “risk factors—business risks—unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business” in item 1a of this report 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payment system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information often resulting from security breaches of third party systems that inappropriately store cardholder account data see “risk factors—business risks—account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in item 1a of this report fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as electronic commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt or the presence of the card or merchant agent is unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our rules and standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents key compliance programs include merchant audits for high fraud excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions and security compliance including our site data protection program which assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises using the payment card industry pci data security standards our customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate 

our customers are responsible for fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or for their merchants from whom they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help detect fraud including mastercard securecode ®  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique personal code and site data protection in addition we offer several fraud detection and prevention programs including our expert monitoring system generally we charge our customers fees for these antifraud programs and services 

enterprise risk management 

mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability 

we have an enterprise risk management “erm” program created to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of risk our erm program aims to proactively manage and monitor key risks improve corporate governance by providing an independent view of our risk profile enhance decisionmaking processes and business performance through an understanding of our risk tolerance and strengthen business operations by integrating erm principles and creating a more risk aware culture within mastercard 

  

intellectual property 

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard ®  maestro ® and cirrus ®  through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards contactless mobile electronic commerce security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations 

competition 

mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased payment systems including credit charge prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments as a result of a global trend electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment and card brands such as mastercard visa american express and discover are benefiting from this displacement however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa including plus electron and interlink american express discover and jcb among others within the global general purpose card industry visa has significantly greater volume than we do 

outside of the united states some of our competitors such as jcb in japan and china union pay ® have leading positions regulation can also play a role in determining competitive market conditions for example china union pay is the sole domestic processor designated by the chinese government and operates the sole national crossbank bankcard information switch network in china due to local regulation privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or another merchant also serve as another form of competition 

in the debit card sector we also encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from atm and pointofsale debit networks in various countries such as interlink™ plus and visa electron owned by visa inc star ® owned by first data corporation nyce ® owned by metavante corporation and pulse™ owned by discover in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia in addition in many countries outside the united states local debit brands serve as the main brands while our brands are used mostly to enable crossborder transactions which typically represent a small portion of overall transaction volume in addition our financial institution customers could also start their own networks and payment card brands to compete with us 

our competitors include operators of proprietary endtoend payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders such as american express and discover these competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy among other things these competitors do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers because they typically have direct relationships with both merchants and cardholders interchange fees which are a characteristic of fourparty payments systems such as ours are subject to increased regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our prospects for future growth and our overall business and thus on our revenue” in item 1a of this report because they do not utilize formal interchange fees operators of endtoend payment networks to date have generally avoided the same regulatory and legislative scrutiny and litigation challenges we face and accordingly may enjoy a competitive advantage over fourparty payments systems 

  

among other companies in our industry visa and discover have changed their ownership structures which could result in their becoming stronger and more efficient companies within the global payments industry in october 2007 visa completed its plan to restructure its organization through the creation of a new stock corporation visa inc owned by its current member financial institutions as part of the reorganization visa europe did not become a subsidiary of visa inc but rather remained owned by various european member financial institutions visa inc completed its initial public offering in 2008 in july 2007 discover began trading on the new york stock exchange as a publiclytraded company following its spinoff from morgan stanley as publiclyowned companies visa inc and discover among other changes may have enhanced access to the capital markets and may operate their respective businesses more transparently and with a greater focus on profitability although they are subject to more public scrutiny and requirements to provide additional disclosures for example discover recently purchased diners club with a view toward expanding its acceptance internationally 

also in 2008 american express and discover received approval to become bank holding companies while bank holding companies are subject to numerous regulatory requirements they also are eligible to request an investment from the us government under the treasury department’s troubled asset relief program “tarp” and may be eligible for similar government programs in the future american express announced in december 2008 that it had requested and was approved to receive a 339 billion investment from the us government under the tarp and discover announced in january 2009 that it had requested and was preliminarily approved to receive a 12 billion investment under the tarp mastercard is not a bank holding company and is not eligible to receive such an investment a tarp or similar investment could strengthen these mastercard competitors 

in addition ongoing litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry for example under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit us merchants now have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states in addition as a result of the court’s decision in our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our former us competitive programs policy “cpp” our customers may now do business with american express or discover in the united states which could adversely affect our business in recent years these competitors have started working with issuing and acquiring financial institutions and therefore replicating certain aspects of endtoend payment networks a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge money now issue or have announced that they will issue american express cards see “risk factors—business risks—our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” in item 1a in this report finally suits against us have been filed in several state and federal courts because of our currency conversion practices although we have settled these matters if the settlements do not receive final approval the outcome of these lawsuits could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict what the final outcome will be of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings for a description of these and other matters see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we compete intensely with other card networks principally visa for the loyalty of our customers in most countries including the united states financial institutions typically issue both mastercard and visabranded payment cards as a result of this structure known as “duality” we compete with visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs issuance of mastercard and visa debit cards on the other hand is generally nondual in the united states this is due to visa’s historical debit exclusivity rule meaning that under the historical rule card issuers could issue either mastercard or visa debit cards but not both as a result of the litigation with the us department of justice visa’s debit exclusivity rule is no longer enforceable and related litigation has been settled see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

  

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of rebates and incentives we provide to our customers and merchants as we have in the last several years we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards however our customers can terminate their business agreements with us in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report 

during the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and based on current economic conditions and weakening of customers’ financial health we have seen this trend accelerate in 2008 we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat for mastercard because our business and pricing strategy is intended to enable mastercard to achieve targeted financial performance by providing incentives to customers for incremental business furthermore it contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard recent consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a substantial loss of business for mastercard the continued consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which mastercard has a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms this pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report 

we face competition with respect to particular segments of the payment card industry in the united states for example some of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by the tendency among us consumers and merchants to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased debit transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions in addition online pinbased transactions are more likely to be processed by other domestic atmdebit pointofsale networks rather than by us see “risk factors—business risks—if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth” in item 1a of this report 

we also face competition from transaction processors throughout the world such as first data corporation and total system services inc some of which are seeking to enhance their networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services certain of these transaction processors could potentially displace mastercard as the provider of these payment processing services 

we also compete against relatively new entrants such as paypal a business segment of ebay which have developed alternative payment systems and payments in electronic commerce and across mobile devices among other services these competitors provide internet payment services that can be used to buy and sell goods online and services that support payments to and from deposit accounts or proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet and potential wireless communication networks to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do in mobile commerce we also face competition from established network operators whereas the mastercard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment account as established by their card issuer network operators may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the customer’s monthly bill or prepaid mobile account 

  

we believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive position in the global payments industry are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 government regulation 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years in particular interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions including the european union see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

furthermore mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers examinations by the ffiec cover areas such as data integrity and data security in recent years the us federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures affecting credit card payment terms and requiring more conservative accounting greater risk management and in some cases higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders in addition mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk 

in addition aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue our customers in the united states are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers 

  

in the united states during the past several years a number of bills have been considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues while no legislation was passed in 2008 congress is likely to continue to consider these issues which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation in europe the european parliament and council passed the european directive 9546ec the “directive” on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject the directive establishes general principles with regard to the processing of personal data including the legal grounds for processing the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the european economic area and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data 

mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352 of the usa patriot act which applies to certain types of financial institutions including operators of credit card systems section 352 of the usa patriot act requires mastercard to maintain a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and imposes similar requirements on some of our customers our antimoney laundering program must be reasonably designed to prevent our system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities the program must at a minimum include the designation of a compliance officer provide for the training of appropriate personnel regarding antimoney laundering responsibilities as well as incorporate policies procedures and controls to mitigate money laundering risks and be independently audited 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by ofac ofac regulations impose restrictions on financial transactions with cuba burmamyanmar iran and sudan and with persons and entities included in the ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” also cuba iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in these countries a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries mastercard takes measures to avoid transactions with persons and entities on the sdn list however it is possible that transactions involving persons or entities on the sdn list may be processed through our payment system it is possible that our reputation may suffer due to our customer financial institutions’ association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

in addition the federal trade commission and the federal banking agencies have issued a number of regulations implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act and at least one other regulation under this law is expected to be issued in 2009 once fully implemented these regulations could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses by increasing costs of issuance andor decreasing the ability of card issuers to set the price of credit the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” along with two other federal banking agencies have also recently issued a regulation pertaining to unfair or deceptive acts or practices pertaining to credit card practices the “udap rule” the udap rule will make it more difficult for credit card issuers to price credit acts for future credit risk which will have an effect on the pricing models of most credit card issuers the udap rule could reduce credit availability or increase the cost of credit to 

  

cardholders possibly affecting mastercard transaction volume and revenues the federal reserve has also issued a comprehensive revision to regulation z which implements the truth in lending act this regulation will have a significant impact on the disclosures made by our customers and could affect their account terms and business practices 

in addition to the udap rule and the revision to regulation z regulators and the us congress have also increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing of credit and their underwriting standards any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or price credit freely could result in reduced amounts of credit available to consumers which could materially and adversely affect our transaction volume and revenues there is also increasing scrutiny of a number of other credit card practices from which many of our customers derive significant revenue by congress and governmental agencies for example in addition to scrutiny of interchange fees described below the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and other senate and house committees and subcommittees are likely to continue their consideration of a variety of our customers’ practices including the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit or overdraft fees are determined imposed and disclosed the us congress may also continue to examine possible changes to the bankruptcy code these investigative efforts and other congressional activity could lead to legislation andor regulation that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses and our business if implemented any such legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or to price credit freely could result in reduced revenue and increased costs for our customers reduced amounts of credit available to consumers and therefore a potential reduction of our transaction volume and revenues 

in the us congress there has been increasing scrutiny of interchange fees in 2008 legislation concerning interchange entitled the “credit card fair fee act of 2008” was introduced in the us house of representatives the house judiciary committee favorably reported this legislation although on a divided vote to the full house of representatives for further consideration the house did not consider the legislation prior to adjourning the version of the legislation ultimately reported by the house judiciary committee seeks to regulate interchange by allowing merchants to collectively seek to lower their interchange costs by exempting such action from the us antitrust laws the credit card fair fee act also requires the us department of justice to observe collective merchant negotiations with mastercard and its customer financial institutions and separately with visa and its customer financial institutions and report results of those negotiations back to the us congress similar legislation to the credit card fair fee act was introduced in the us senate but there were no hearings on or further movement of such legislation additional interchange legislation also was introduced in the house but there were no further developments with respect to such legislation we expect that the credit card fair fee act and other legislation pertaining to interchange will be introduced in congress in 2009 it is not clear whether congress will act on such legislation and what form any such legislation may ultimately take 

in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is being implemented through a federal rulemaking process that was completed in december 2008 these federal rules will require us and our customers to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs andor decrease our transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations 

  

could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth 

outside of the united states regulators in several other countries have become increasingly interested in payment industry issues some of which have launched official proceedings into payment industry issues see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

 item 1a risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks 

interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business and thus on our revenue 

interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank the acquirer to the cardholder bank the issuer in connection with transactions initiated with our payment system’s cards interchange fees including our default interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense litigation and regulatory scrutiny worldwide as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies merchants in the us and new zealand and regulators in a number of countries are seeking to reduce these fees through litigation or regulatory action for example 

 

   

 although mastercard believes that any business practices it would implement in response to the decision would be in compliance with the decision the european commission may deem any such practice not in compliance with the decision or in violation of european competition law in which case mastercard may be assessed fines for the period that it is not in compliance furthermore because a balancing mechanism like default crossborder interchange fees constitutes an essential element of mastercard europe’s operations the decision could also significantly impact mastercard international’s european customers’ and mastercard europe’s business the european commission decision could also lead to competition authorities in one or more eu member states commencing investigations or proceedings regarding domestic interchange fees in addition the european commission’s decision could lead to the filing of private actions against mastercard europe by merchants andor consumers which if mastercard is unsuccessful in its appeal of the decision could result in mastercard owing substantial damages in october 2008 mastercard received an information request from the european commission in connection with the decision concerning certain pricing changes that mastercard has implemented as of october 2008 mastercard submitted its response in november 2008 mastercard understands that the european commission is contemplating commencing a formal proceeding concerning the pricing changes on the basis that they contravene the decision see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more details regarding the european commission’s decision 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 in october 2008 the south african national assembly the “na” adopted amendments to that country’s competition laws concerning socalled “complex monopolies” and criminalizing violations of those laws the “bill” on january 29 2009 the president of south africa referred the bill back to the national assembly for further consideration and recently indicated that he may submit the bill to that country’s constitutional court for examination if the na fails to act on his request if the bill is ultimately determined to be constitutional and becomes law it could have a significant adverse impact on mastercard’s business in south africa 

 

  

   

interchange fees andor related practices such as the “honor all cards” rule are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions including brazil colombia czech republic mexico venezuela estonia israel italy norway portugal switzerland and turkey we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a coordinated approach to interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions in the united states interchange fees have also been the topic of increased congressional and regulatory interest in 2008 legislation concerning interchange entitled the “credit card fair fee act of 2008” was introduced in the us house of representatives the house judiciary committee favorably reported this legislation although on a divided vote to the full house of representatives for further consideration the house did not consider the legislation prior to adjourning the version of the legislation ultimately reported by the house judiciary committee seeks to regulate interchange by allowing merchants to collectively seek to lower their interchange costs by exempting such action from the us antitrust laws the credit card fair fee act also requires the us department of justice to observe collective merchant negotiations with the company and its customer financial institutions and separately with visa and its customer financial institutions and report results of those negotiations back to the us congress similar legislation to the credit card fair fee act was introduced in the us senate but there were no hearings on or further movement of the legislation additional interchange legislation was also introduced in the house in 2008 but there were no further developments with respect to such legislation we expect that the credit card fair fee act and other legislation pertaining to interchange will be reintroduced in congress in 2009 it is not clear whether congress will act on such legislation and what form any such legislation may ultimately take 

in addition merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees through litigation in the united states merchants have filed approximately 50 classaction or individual suits alleging that our interchange fees violate federal antitrust laws these suits allege among other things that our purported setting of interchange fees constitutes horizontal pricefixing between and among mastercard visa and their member banks in violation of section 1 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade the suits seek treble damages in an unspecified amount attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees they may be unable to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge if we are less successful than visa in defending interchange fees we could also be competitively disadvantaged against visa if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees such regulation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business in addition this could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

if the settlements of our currency conversion cases are not ultimately approved and we are unsuccessful in any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we generate significant revenue from processing crossborder currency transactions for members however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in particular a trial judge in california found that our currency conversion practice is deceptive under california state law and ordered us to mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to california cardholders the decision 

  

was reversed on appeal on grounds that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue his claims in addition we have been served with similar complaints in several state courts seeking to in effect extend the judge’s decision to mastercard cardholders outside of california we have succeeded in having several of these cases dismissed or transferred to the us district court for the southern district of new york and combined with putative federal class actions the class actions allege that our currency conversion practices violate federal antitrust laws on july 20 2006 mastercard and the other defendants in the federal class actions entered into agreements settling those cases and related matters as well as the california state case pursuant to the settlement agreements mastercard has paid 72 million to be used for defendants’ settlement fund to settle the federal actions and 13 million to settle the california case the settlement agreements are subject to final approval by the court and resolution of all appeals if final approval of the settlement agreements is not granted and we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits or the state currency conversion cases we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards in another country or may be required to modify our currency conversion practices see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

except with respect to currency conversion litigations and the california consumer state action discussed in note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report we have not established reserves for any of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future we may determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any of our legal proceedings is required including charges related to legal fees in addition we may be required to record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of reserves that we have previously recorded such charges particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report these limitations and any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the payments industry is generally the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may impose costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and lead to decreased transaction volumes through our systems 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular our customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently mastercard is at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years for example in 2002 mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act which has required our customers and us 

  

to create and implement comprehensive antimoney laundering programs in india the government appears poised to enact an antimoney laundering law that may impose requirements on payment systems such as mastercards’ and their customers moreover the indian payments and settlement systems act 2007 requires that payment system operators such as mastercard obtain authorization by february 2009 from the reserve bank of india “rbi” to operate a payments system and grants broad oversight authority to the rbi increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by ofac ofac regulations impose restrictions on financial transactions with cuba burmamyanmar iran and sudan and with persons and entities included on the sdn list also cuba iran sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in these countries a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries mastercard takes measures to avoid transactions with persons and entities on the sdn list however it is possible that transactions involving persons or entities on the sdn list may be processed through our payment system it is possible that our reputation may suffer due to some of our financial institutions’ association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

in addition the federal trade commission and the federal banking agencies have issued a number of regulations implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act and at least one other regulation under this law is expected to be issued in 2009 once fully implemented these regulations could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses by increasing costs of issuance andor decreasing the ability of card issuers to set the price of credit the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” with two other federal banking agencies have also recently issued a regulation pertaining to unfair or deceptive acts or practices pertaining to credit card practices the “udap rule” the udap rule will make it more difficult for credit card issuers to price credit cards for future credit risk and it will significantly affect the pricing models of most credit card issuers the udap rule could reduce credit availability or increase the cost of credit to cardholders possibly affecting mastercard transaction volume and revenues the federal reserve has also issued a comprehensive revision to regulation z which implements the truth in lending act this regulation will have a significant impact on the disclosures made by our customers and could affect their account terms and business practices 

in addition to the udap rule and the revision to regulation z regulators and the us congress have also increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing of credit and their underwriting standards any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or price credit freely could result in reduced amounts of credit available to consumers which could materially and adversely affect our transaction volume and revenues there is also increasing scrutiny of a number of other credit card practices from which many of our customers derive significant revenue by congress and governmental agencies for example in addition to scrutiny of interchange fees the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and other senate and house committees and subcommittees are likely to continue their consideration of a variety of our customers’ practices including the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit or overdraft fees are determined imposed and disclosed the us congress may also continue to examine possible changes to the bankruptcy code these investigative efforts and other congressional activity could lead to legislation andor regulation that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses and our business if implemented 

  

any such legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or to price credit freely could result in reduced revenue and increased costs for our customers reduced amounts of credit available to consumers and therefore a potential reduction of our transaction volume and revenues 

in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is being implemented through a federal rulemaking process that was completed in december 2008 these federal rules will require us and our customers to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs andor decrease our transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly these new requirements and developments may affect both us and our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth 

increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

our ability to compete effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries could be curtailed by government actions which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies our efforts to effect change in countries where our access to the domestic payments segment is limited may not be successful which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs 

we and our customers are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we and our customers could be negatively impacted by these regulations for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to federal trade commission and banking agency information safeguard requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguards rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue in the united states over the past several years a number of bills have been considered by congress and there have 

  

been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues while no legislation was passed in 2008 congress is likely to continue to consider these issues which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers in addition a number of states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

in the european union the european parliament and council have passed the european directive 9546ec on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data this directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject 

regulation of privacy and data use and security in these and other jurisdictions may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment cards which may decrease the number of our cards that they issue any additional regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations which could materially and adversely affect our profitability finally failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

business risks 

unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected many of our customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects growth profitability revenue and overall business 

during 2008 unprecedented events occurred in the financial markets around the world resulting in distress in the credit environment equity market volatility and government intervention in particular the economies of the united states and the united kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil however it also impacted other economies around the world some existing customers have gone bankrupt or have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by the government many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted as a result our operating results have begun to be impacted or could be negatively impacted in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on prospects growth revenue profitability and overall business 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes enter new markets and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to customers that issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

our strategy is to grow our business by among other things focusing on our customers and entering into customized business agreements with customers around the globe in the future we may not be able to enter into such agreements on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and based on current economic conditions we have seen this trend accelerate in 2008 we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat to us because our strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments recent consolidations have included customers with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the substantial loss of business for mastercard which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

  

the continued consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which mastercard has a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term if we lose one or more of our most significant customers which could have a material adverse longterm impact on our business 

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2008 the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 15 billion or 30 of total revenue no single customer generates 10 of total revenue loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard for instance as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 18 obligations under litigation settlements and note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report in addition some large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our prospects for future growth and our overall business and thus our revenue” the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings merchants are also able to negotiate pricing discounts and other incentives from us and our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks cardbased systems including credit charge prepaid privatelabel and other types of general purpose and limited use cards and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments see “business—competition” in item 1 of this report some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider 

  

range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have 

among other companies in our industry visa and discover have changed their ownership structures which could result in them becoming stronger and more efficient companies within the global payments industry in october 2007 visa completed its plan to restructure its organization through the creation of a new stock corporation visa inc owned by its current member financial institutions as part of the reorganization visa europe did not become a subsidiary of visa inc but rather remained owned by various european member financial institutions visa inc completed its initial public offering in march 2008 in july 2007 discover began trading on the new york stock exchange as a publiclytraded company following its spinoff from morgan stanley as publiclyowned companies visa and discover among other changes may have enhanced access to the capital markets and may improve operating results which could be used to enhance their competitive position if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies then use of our programs and products could decline which would have an adverse impact on our revenues 

in the us in 2008 american express and discover received approval to become bank holding companies while bank holding companies are subject to numerous regulatory requirements they also are eligible to request an investment from the us government under the tarp and may be eligible for similar government programs in the future american express announced in december 2008 that it had requested and was approved to receive a 339 billion investment from the us government under the tarp and discover announced in january 2009 that it had requested and was preliminarily approved to receive a 12 billion investment under the tarp mastercard is not a bank holding company and is not eligible to receive such an investment a tarp or similar investment could strengthen such competitors of mastercard 

based on a final judgment in 2004 of our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our former cpp our customers are now permitted to issue general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network such as american express or discover this may cause our customers to issue fewer cards with our brand and to enter into arrangements with our competitors to issue cards thereby reducing the volume of transactions that we process and decreasing our revenues a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge money now issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards accordingly if our customers issue more competitor branded cards than mastercard branded cards it may have a material adverse affect on our business revenue and profitability 

certain of our competitors including american express discover privatelabel card networks and certain alternative payments systems operate endtoend payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers without involving intermediaries these competitors seek to derive competitive advantages from their business models for example operators of end to end payments systems tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operators of four party payments systems such as ours in which we must rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customers in addition these competitors have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practices as have operators of four party payments systems such as ours 

if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth as a result our revenue or profitability could decline we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems and payments in electronic commerce and for mobile devices a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

  

we also expect that there may be changes in the competitive landscape in the future including 

 

  

  

 our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our revenues operating results prospects for future growth and overall business 

a significant portion of the revenue we earn outside the united states is generated from crossborder transactions and a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from fees for processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions in addition we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with cross border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency in particular international geopolitical economic and other conditions including the threat of terrorism and outbreak of diseases could cause a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow faster than the financial institutions that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to 

  

cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our central processing systems because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payment system among regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the marketplace’s perception of our brands and reputation 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to mastercardbranded products is highly dependent upon the external perception of our company and industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our business 

if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth 

we believe that in recent years industrywide offline and online debit transactions have grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions however in the united states transactions involving our brands account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low penetration in the united states we may not be able to increase our penetration for debit transactions in the united states since many of our competitors have longstanding and strong positions we may also be impacted adversely by the tendency among us consumers and merchants to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions in addition online pinbased 

  

transactions are more likely to be processed by other atmdebit pointofsale networks rather than by us any of these factors may inhibit the growth of our debit business which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and overall prospects for future growth 

global political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our revenue and profitability 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending in addition to the effects of general economic conditions increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands also as we are principally based in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business prospects and growth 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations 

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfalls insolvency or other reasons if a principal member or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard international is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not contractually obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations in order to maintain the integrity and acceptance of our brands our estimated gross legal settlement exposure which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 24 billion as of december 31 2008 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 25 billion which could be used to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by any of our largest customers on their peak day concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest customers or of several of our smaller customers may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition moreover during 2008 many of our financial institution customers were directly and adversely impacted by the unprecedented events that occurred in the financial markets and the economic turmoil that ensued around the world these events present increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantees for more information on our settlement exposure as of december 31 2008 see note 21 settlement and travelers cheque risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire natural or manmade disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism accident or other catastrophic events a disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers such as att bt and orange for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability 

  

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue 

we our customers and other third parties store cardholder account and other information in connection with payment cards bearing our brands in addition our customers may sponsor thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our cards damage the reputation of our brands and lead to claims against us in 2007 and 2008 there were several highprofile account data compromise events involving merchant systems that process and store information related to credit and debit card transactions which affected and may potentially affect millions of mastercard visa discover and american express cardholders as a result we may be subject to lawsuits in connection with data security breaches involving payment cards carrying our brands if we are unsuccessful in defending lawsuits involving such data security breaches we may be forced to pay damages which could materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition any damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes revenue and future growth prospects or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeit or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance adoption of new technologies or enhanced security requirements and damage to our reputation and financial damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which would reduce our revenue and income 

the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes or by intellectual property rights of third parties our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our international operations 

during 2008 approximately 528 of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse 

  

changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may evaluate or make strategic acquisitions of or acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities related to complementary businesses products or technologies while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies anticipate continuing to make these evaluations and have made certain recent acquisitions including interests in joint ventures and other alliances we have no present understandings commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions if we do make such an acquisition however we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition as a result of costs of operations including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition furthermore we may not be able to successfully integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies in particular the integration of any acquisition including efforts related to an acquisition of an interest in a joint venture or other entity may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations moreover we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue in addition to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders 

changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect our benefit plans 

we provide certain retirement benefits to our us employees through the mastercard accumulation plan map a qualified cash balance benefit plan the pension protection act of 2006 provides that from january 29 2005 and on cash balance plans should not be deemed inherently age discriminatory in addition all five of the us circuits that have considered the question of whether cash balance plans are age discriminatory have held that cash balance plans do not violate the age discrimination provisions of erisa however should any other us circuit resolve the issue differently we may be required to amend the map and like other us companies with cash balance plans may be exposed to claims from plan participants these developments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure 

future sales of our shares of class a common stock could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future as of february 12 2009 we had 98514196 outstanding shares of class a common stock of which 13496933 shares were owned by the foundation under the terms of the donation the foundation may sell its shares of our class a common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements under canadian tax law the foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 35 of its assets not used in administration of the foundation in qualified charitable disbursements however the foundation has obtained permission from the canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to ten years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the tenyear period despite this permission to defer annual disbursements the foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year in addition the foundation will be permitted to sell all of the remaining shares held by it starting twenty years and eleven months after the consummation of the ipo 

  

in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that holders of our class b common stock would be eligible through “conversion transactions” in amounts and at times to be designated by the company to convert their shares of class b common stock into shares of our class a common stock on a oneforone basis for subsequent transfer or sale to an eligible holder subject to annual aggregate and other limits the company completed two such voluntary conversion programs during 2007 and one such program during 2008 and has announced that it expects to provide such a program in 2009 after may 31 2010 holders of our class b common stock will have the option to convert all of their shares of class b common stock into shares of class a common stock on a oneforone basis for subsequent sale to the public without aggregate amounts or similar limitations all of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares will be freely tradable without restriction or registration under the securities act by persons other than our affiliates these future sales or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile 

securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations and have experienced increased volatility in connection with recent unpredictable economic events around the world this market volatility as well as the factors listed below among others could affect the market price of our common stock 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock the class b common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further no member or former member of mastercard international or any operator member or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

the foundation owns 13496933 shares of class a common stock representing as of february 12 2009 approximately 14 of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to the date which is twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements starting on the fourth anniversary of the ipo the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our members the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders 

the holders of our class m common stock have the right to elect up to three of our directors and to approve significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of our other stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to obtain the approval of the holders of our class m common stock voting separately as a class for a variety of enumerated actions for example the approval of the holders of our class m common stock is required to make certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation to approve the sale lease or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets to approve the consummation of mergers or consolidations of mastercard or for us to cease to engage in the business of providing core network authorization clearing and settlement services for branded payment card transactions in addition the holders of our class m common stock have the right to elect up to three of our directors because shares of the class m common stock do not have any economic rights the holders of the class m common stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable for the holders of class a common stock or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class a common stock 

certain aspects of our european operations are managed by the european board which has been elected by the european holders of class m common stock and which may reach different decisions than our board of directors 

certain aspects of our european operations including review of membership applications establishment of intraregional operating rules and implementation of certain intraregional product and enhancement developments and affinity and cobranding rules are managed by or under the direction of our european board the european 

  

board is elected by holders of our class m common stock who have their principal operations in europe and consists of representatives of our european members although our board of directors may through a majority or a twothirds vote depending on the circumstances override decisions or temporarily assume any authority granted to the european board the european board may reach different decisions than our board of directors would have reached on the same matter 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our holders of class a common stock and class b common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

mastercard intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely the payment of dividends is dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition settlement guarantees operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs if as a consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make or may have to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock

we recorded a net loss of 254 million or 195 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2008 versus net income of 11 billion or 800 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2007 and net income of 50 million or 037 per diluted share in 2006 as of december 31 2008 our liquidity and capital positions remained strong with 21 billion in cash cash equivalents and current availableforsale securities and 19 billion in stockholders’ equity as of december 31 2008 

net revenue growth of 227 in 2008 was primarily due to increased transactions and volumes the foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the brazilian real against the dollar contributed 25 percentage points of the increase while pricing adjustments contributed approximately 6 percentage points to the net revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2008 we began to experience a slowdown in purchase volumes and transactions primarily due to economic conditions around the world see “—business environment challenges” for additional information 

our operating expenses increased 867 in 2008 excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in “—operating expenses” operating expenses increased 29 in 2008 of which 17 percentage points was due to foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and brazilian real against the us dollar the increase in operating expenses in 2008 was primarily due to litigation settlements see “—litigation settlements” and note 18 obligations under litigation settlements and note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information related to our litigation settlements the increase in operating expenses in 2008 excluding the impact of special items was primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses and foreign currency fluctuations partially offset by decreases in advertising and marketing expenses our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 1107 in 2008 versus 728 in 2007 and 931 in 2006 excluding the impact of special items our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 610 in 2008 versus 727 in 2007 and 805 in 2006 

other income in 2008 included realized gains of approximately 86 million for the sale of the remaining shares of an availableforsale security redecard sa and 75 million related to the termination of a customer business agreement other income in 2007 included realized gains of approximately 391 million for the partial sale of our holdings of equity securities of redecard sa that were classified as an availableforsale security and 90 million from the organization that operates the world cup soccer events in resolution of all outstanding disputes pertaining to our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 world cup soccer events see “—other income expense” 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as card payment transactions creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our 

  

existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as premiumaffluent and contactless cards commercial payments debit prepaid and issuer processor and terminal driving services enhancing our merchant relationships expanding points of acceptance for our brands seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world we are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing and consulting and information services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the longterm we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time see “—business environment challenges” for discussion of environmental considerations related to our strategic objectives 

  

financial results 

 

  

   

       

impact of foreign currency rates 

our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real accordingly the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar during 2008 2007 and 2006 the us dollar weakened against the euro and brazilian real which increased revenues and expenses more recently the us dollar has begun to strengthen against the euro and brazilian real and if this trend continues revenues and expenses will decrease 

in addition changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume “gdv” and gross euro volume “gev” which are used in the calculation of our assessment revenues in most noneuropean regions gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period as a result our assessment revenues are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most noneuropean local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies in 2008 and 2007 gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis was 115 and 184 respectively versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 107 and 144 respectively 

business environment challenges 

we process transactions from approximately 210 countries and territories and in more than 160 currencies the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business the united states is our largest geographic market based on revenues revenue generated in the united states was approximately 472 497 and 523 of total revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period however revenues generated from certain nonus countries have grown faster than united states revenues due to differences in market maturity economic health price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in those countries while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 

during 2008 unprecedented events occurred in the financial markets around the world resulting in distress in the credit environment equity market volatility and government intervention in particular the economies of the united states and the united kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil however it also impacted other economies around the world some existing customers have gone bankrupt or have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by the government many of our financial institution customers merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted as a result our operating results have begun to be impacted or could be negatively impacted in several ways including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our business is subject to regulation in many countries regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry for example see note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a discussion of global interchange proceedings 

revenues 

we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments gdv includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage purchases cash disbursements balance transfers and convenience checks on mastercardbranded cards our pricing for transactions and services is complex each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers 

operations fees are transactionbased and are also volumebased and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers mastercard’s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders’ banks acquirers the merchants’ banks merchants and cardholders operations fees are charged to issuers acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services specific programs to promote mastercardbranded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses the significant components of operations fees are as follows 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 assessment fees are primarily based on a customer’s gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate gdv assessments that are based on quarterly gdv are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance from time to time the company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs 

our gross revenues from operations fees and assessments vary and are dependent on the nature of the transactions and gdv generated from those transactions the combination of the following transaction characteristics for operations andor assessment fees determines the pricing 

 

  

  

   

  

 we process most of the crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states united kingdom canada brazil and australia crossborder transactions generate greater revenue than domestic transactions due to higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch and are also subject to crossborder and currency conversion fees in addition higher operations fees are charged on signature transactions than online transactions 

in 2008 and 2007 gross revenues grew 198 and 204 respectively revenue growth was the result of increased transactions and gdv as well as price increases and currency fluctuation our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives accordingly we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide gdv and other performancebased support incentives the rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs the continued consolidation of our customers and the growing influence of merchants have led to enhanced competition in the global payments industry and demand for better pricing arrangements our revenue growth was moderated by a 145 million or 110 and a 173 million or 150 increase in rebates and incentives to our customers and merchants in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2008 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 15 billion or 30 of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report 

  

operations fees 

the significant components in operations fees are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

    

 assessments 

assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers’ gdv the components of assessments are as follows 

 

 gross assessments grew partially due to gdv growth of approximately 107 and 144 in 2008 and 2007 respectively when measured in local currency terms and 115 and 184 respectively when measured on a us dollar converted basis assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar and euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period in october 2008 we increased certain assessment fees and introduced a new assessment fee to acquirers in europe these price changes in october 2008 contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2008 in 2007 gross assessments also grew due to an increase in assessable volumes for market development programs in specific countries within europe in addition revenue growth rates in 2007 were impacted by a reclassification of 31 million from assessments to currency conversion and crossborder revenues offset by 12 million in pricing increases related to our april 2006 sepa pricing changes the increase in 2007 gross assessments excluding the impact of the reclassifications and the pricing increase would have been 113 

rebates and incentives are primarily based on gdv but may also contain components for the issuance of new cards launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs the rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 474 482 and 499 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively rebates and incentives increased during 2008 and 2007 due to new and renewals of customer agreements and increased volumes for certain merchants however the increase in 2008 was partially offset by reductions of rebates and incentives for certain customers that did not achieve contractual performance hurdles these reductions in rebates 

  

and incentives decreased rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments in 2008 and 2007 rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments fluctuated with the timing and structure of pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and marketing litigation settlements contributions to the foundation and depreciation and amortization expenses in 2008 there was an increase in operating expenses of 2567 million or 867 versus 2007 this increase was primarily due to the settlement of antitrust litigations with discover financial services “discover” and the “discover settlement” and american express company “american express” and the “american express settlement” the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses excluding litigation settlements and the 2006 stock contribution to the foundation “special items” which is a nongaap financial measure to operating expenses including special items which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement management uses these types of nongaap financial measures to evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results and believes this analysis may be helpful to an investor’s evaluation of ongoing operating results 

 

  

     

general and administrative 

the major components of general and administrative expenses are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 advertising and marketing 

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness preference and usage through integrated advertising sponsorship promotional interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale we will also continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences also included within advertising and marketing are costs associated with offering cardholder benefits such as insurance and travel assistance for certain programs 

advertising and marketing expenses decreased 62 million or 58 and increased 28 million or 27 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in 2008 was primarily due to cost containment initiatives partially offset by approximately 2 percentage points related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and 

  

brazilian real to the us dollar the increase in advertising and marketing in 2007 was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and brazilian real to the us dollar in addition in 2008 and 2007 our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships and the timing of certain advertising and marketing expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions in 2006 a significant amount of our advertising and marketing activities were allocated to the sponsorship of the 2006 world cup soccer events during 2007 we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 world cup soccer events see note 24 other income to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion of this settlement agreement 

litigation settlements 

on october 27 2008 mastercard and visa inc “visa” entered into the discover settlement with discover relating to the us federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties the discover settlement ended all litigation between the parties for a total of 275 billion in july 2008 mastercard and visa entered into a judgment sharing agreement in accordance with the terms of the judgment sharing agreement mastercard’s share of the discover settlement was 863 million which was paid to discover in november 2008 additionally in connection with the discover settlement morgan stanley discover’s former parent company paid mastercard 35 million in november 2008 pursuant to a separate agreement the net pretax expense of 828 million was recorded in litigation settlements in the consolidated statement of operations during the third quarter of 2008 

on june 24 2008 mastercard entered into the american express settlement which ended all existing litigation between american express and mastercard under the terms of the american express settlement beginning on september 15 2008 mastercard is required to pay american express up to 150 million each quarter for 12 quarters payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter for a maximum amount of 18 billion the charge is based on mastercard’s assumption that american express will achieve certain financial performance hurdles the quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15 of american express’ united states global network services billings during the quarter up to a maximum of 150 million per quarter if however the payment for any quarter is less than 150 million the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between 150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall mastercard recorded the present value of 18 billion at a 575 discount rate or 1649 billion pretax in the second quarter of 2008 

in the first quarter of 2003 mastercard entered into a settlement agreement the “us merchant lawsuit settlement” related to the us merchant lawsuit described under the caption “us merchant and consumer litigations” in note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and recorded a pretax charge of 721 million 469 million aftertax consisting of i the monetary amount of the us merchant lawsuit settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant lawsuit settlement and iii costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit the 721 million pretax charge amount was an estimate which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors 

  

we recorded liabilities for certain litigation settlements in prior periods total liabilities for litigation settlements changed from december 31 2006 as follows 

 

  

 contribution expense — foundation 

in may 2006 in conjunction with our initial public offering “ipo” we issued 13496933 shares of our class a common stock as a donation to the foundation that is incorporated in canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our customers the foundation builds on mastercard’s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education understand and utilize technology and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force the vision of the foundation is to make the economy work for everybody by advancing innovative programs in areas of microfinance and youth education in connection with the donation of the class a common stock we recorded an expense of 395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated in both 2007 and 2006 we recorded expenses of 20 million for cash donations we made to the foundation completing our intention announced at the time of the ipo to donate approximately 40 million in cash to the foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations we may make additional cash contributions to the foundation in the future the cash and stock donations to the foundation are generally not deductible by mastercard for tax purposes as a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 is significantly higher than our effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2008 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 14 million in 2008 and decreased 2 million in 2007 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 is primarily due to increased investments in leasehold and building improvements data center equipment and capitalized software the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 was primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated depreciation and amortization will increase as we continue to invest in leasehold and building improvements data center equipment and capitalized software 

  

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense and other gains and losses 

 

  

  

 income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 was 337 350 and 829 respectively the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the impact of the charges associated with the discover settlement and american express settlement these charges caused a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income resulting in pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions and pretax loss in higher tax jurisdictions the resulting tax benefit of the loss was offset by a tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the company’s state effective tax rate as a result of the remeasurement the company’s deferred tax assets were reduced by 20 million and an income tax expense was recorded for the same amount the change in the effective income tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily relates to a nondeductible charitable contribution of shares of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation during 2006 mastercard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of the class a common stock we donated to the foundation under the terms of the contribution to the foundation this donation is generally not deductible to mastercard for tax purposes 

the components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 are as follows 

 

   

the company’s gaap effective income tax rate for 2008 was significantly affected by the tax benefits related to the charges for the discover settlement and the american express settlement the company’s effective tax rate for 2006 was significantly affected by the 395 million charitable contribution of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation due to the nonrecurring nature of these items the company believes that the calculation of the 2008 effective tax rate excluding the impacts of the discover settlement and american express settlement and the 2006 effective tax rate excluding the impact of the charitable stock contribution to the foundation will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to service our obligations related to litigation settlements at december 31 2008 and 2007 we had 21 billion and 30 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and current availableforsale securities to use for our operations our stockholder’s equity was 19 billion and 30 billion as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively we believe that the cash generated from operations our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital needs debt and litigation settlement obligations our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are still a party see item 1a note 18 obligations under litigation settlements and note 20 legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and “business environment challenges” in item 7 of this report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2008 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances 

 

  

     

     seasonality 

our revenues are contingent upon the underlying metrics on which the revenues are calculated gross revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were negatively impacted by lower purchase volumes and transactions due to the economic crisis in response mastercard accelerated its cost savings initiatives in the quarter with particular focus on advertising personnel and travel expenses historically during the fourth quarter our quarterly gross revenues have been positively impacted by increases in purchase volume related to the holiday shopping period with offsetting increases resulting from higher rebates and incentives to our customers also operating expenses have historically been higher in the fourth quarter due to additional advertising and promotions related to the holiday period and increases in personnel incentives for exceeding the company’s objectives the economic environment in 2008 caused our operating results to diverge from these historical trends 

  

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

 

   

   

   

   

   

 recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” which replaces sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas 141r establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 discloses the business combination sfas 141r applies to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses including transactions that occur without the transfer of any type of consideration sfas 141r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations on or after january 1 2009 with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies early adoption is not allowed the company will adopt sfas 141r on january 1 2009 and its effect on future periods will be dependent upon the nature and significance of any acquisitions subject to this statement 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 amends arb no 51 “consolidated financial statements” and establishes accounting and reporting standards that require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity in addition changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions and upon a loss of control retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings sfas 160 is effective for the company on january 1 2009 except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively early adoption is not allowed the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas 160 will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position

 in december 2008 the fasb issued staff position 132r1 “employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets” “fsp sfas 132r1” fsp sfas 132r1 provides guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension plan or other postretirement plan including disclosure of how investment allocation decisions are made major categories of plan assets inputs and valuation techniques used to 

  

measure the fair value of plan assets and concentrations of credit risk fsp sfas 132r1 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 fsp sfas 132r1 will not impact the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position as its requirements are disclosureonly in nature 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies which have been approved by the board of directors governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there were no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2008 as compared to december 31 2007 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months 

 

 our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of 16 other transaction currencies the remaining 143 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

  

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as availableforsale investments with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure the fair value and maturity distribution of the company’s available for sale investments as of december 31 was as follows 

 

  

 at december 31 2008 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement we had no material borrowings at december 31 2008 or 2007 see note 13 debt to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information 

in addition as of december 31 2008 we had a 736 fixed shortterm secured note for 149 million with a fair value of 155 million relating to the company’s variable interest entity see note 15 consolidation of variable interest entity to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information 

equity price risk 

the company did not have significant equity price risk as of december 31 2008 at december 31 2007 mastercard’s investment in shares of redecard sa common stock which was classified as an availableforsale security was subject to equity price risk at december 31 2007 the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would have been approximately 10 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit debit and related payment programs of over 25000 financial institutions that are our customers through our threetiered business model as franchisor processor and advisor we develop and market payment solutions process payment transactions and provide consulting and information services to our customers and merchants we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic™ maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our customers as part of managing these brands we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments 

a typical transaction processed over our system involves four parties in addition to us the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholder’s bank and the acquirer the merchant’s bank consequently the payment system we operate is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system our customers are the financial institutions that act as issuers and acquirers using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient quick and secure payment method that is accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customer financial institutions to ensure the integrity of our payment system in addition we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands however cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

  

our business has a global reach and has experienced significant growth gross dollar volume “gdv” on cards carrying the mastercard brand as reported by our customers was approximately 23 trillion in 2007 an 184 increase in us dollar terms and a 144 increase in local currency terms over the gdv reported in 2006 in 2007 we processed 187 billion transactions a 162 increase over the number of transactions processed in 2006 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as premiumaffluent and contactless cards commercial payments and debit enhancing our merchant relationships seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world we are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing and consulting and information services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the longterm we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time and in support of this strategy we continue to ensure our resources are appropriately aligned with our corporate strategy and we continue to develop additional sales and other support personnel 

we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment in recent years we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny particularly with respect to interchange fees and other legal challenges interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers have been the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers entitled to receive them we do not earn revenues for interchange fees however if issuers were unable to collect interchange fees or were to receive reduced interchange fees we may experience a reduction in the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system such as ours andor a reduction in the rate of number of cards issued as well as lower overall transaction volumes proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment may also become more attractive issuers might also decide to charge higher fees to cardholders thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge in addition to those challenges relating to interchange fees we are also exposed to a variety of significant lawsuits and regulatory actions including federal antitrust claims and claims under state unfair competition statutes see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in item 1a of this report 

mastercard incorporated was incorporated as a delaware stock corporation in may 2001 we conduct our business principally through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” a delaware membership corporation that was formed in november 1966 our financial institution customers are generally principal members of mastercard international which participate directly in mastercard international’s business or affiliate members of mastercard international which participate indirectly in mastercard international’s business through a principal member in may 2006 we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure for mastercard incorporated which we refer to as the “ownership and governance transactions” and which included the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors who are independent from our financial institution customers and the establishment of a charitable foundation incorporated in canada the mastercard foundation the “foundation” part of the ownership and governance transactions included an initial public offering of a new class of common stock the “ipo” in may 2006 prior to our change in governance and ownership structure the common stock of mastercard incorporated was owned by principal members of mastercard international for more information about our capital structure voting rights of our common stock repurchases of our class a common stock and conversions of shares of our class b common stock into shares of our voting class a common stock see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

  

our industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

 

  

  

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 

  

  

 the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard maestro visa ®  american express ®  jcb ®  diners club ® and discover ®  historically these brands—including mastercard—were principally associated with “pay later” credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets today mastercard and visa cards may be issued in any of the “pay later” “pay now” or “pay before” categories 

“pay now” cards may be further categorized into several subsegments 

 

  

  

 regional and domesticlocal pinbased debit brands are the primary brands in many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and other brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of the overall number of transactions 

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a significant portion of all cardbased forms of payment typically private label cards are issued by a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at the issuing merchant’s locations 

  

payment services 

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services to our customers in connection with these services we deploy dedicated customer relationship management teams to our customers to provide them with customized solutions built upon our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing and consulting and information services 

we generate revenues from the fees we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services these fees are typically transactionbased and include fees for authorization clearing and settlement we also earn revenues by charging our customers assessments based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted by the number of transactions that we process and by the use of cards carrying our brands the table below provides some information regarding gdv which is one of the key drivers of our revenues 

gross dollar volume  gdv 

the mastercardbranded gdv table below provides information regarding the gdv for all mastercardbranded cards excluding cirrus and maestro and for both mastercard credit and charge card programs and mastercard debit programs in the united states and in all of our regions other than the united states for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 growth rates are provided on both a us dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated gdv represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with mastercardbranded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks

transaction processing 

introduction  we operate a system that links issuers and acquirers around the globe for transaction processing services and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards at millions of merchants worldwide a typical transaction processed over our system involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders’ banks acquirers the merchants’ banks merchants and cardholders the following diagram depicts a typical pointofsale card transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder a purchases goods or services from a merchant b using a card after the transaction is authorized by the issuer d using our network the acquirer c pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount to the merchant this discount which we refer to as the merchant discount takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee described below the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus any interchange fee and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account our rules generally guarantee the payment of transactions using mastercardbranded cards and certain transactions using cirrus and maestrobranded cards between issuers and acquirers 

in this fourparty payment system the economics of a card transaction to mastercard vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over our network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

a significant portion of the merchant discount is generally paid from the acquirer to the issuer in the form of an interchange fee the balance of the merchant discount is retained by the acquirer to cover its costs and profit margin acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers operational fees and assessments for the services we provide them 

interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and passed to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers we establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other interchange fee arrangements in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the 

  

settlement process however we do not earn revenues from them as noted above interchange fees are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards and are currently subject to regulatory or legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in item 1a of this report 

mastercard revenue sources  mastercard generates revenues by charging transaction processing and related fees and gdvbased and cardbased assessments to both issuers and acquirers the allocation of our revenues between operations fees and assessments and among issuers and acquirers varies across our regions issuers typically pay operations fees and assessments acquirers principally pay assessments on gdv as well as certain operations fees on an aggregate basis we earned approximately 738 of our net revenues in connection with operations fees and approximately 262 of our net revenues in connection with assessments in 2007 in 2006 on an aggregate basis we earned approximately 731 of our net revenues in connection with operations fees and approximately 269 of our net revenues in connection with assessments operations fees are typically transactionbased and include authorization settlement and switch fees crossborder and currency conversion fees and other operations fees such as acceptance development fees cardholder services compliance and penalty fees holograms and userpay fees for a variety of account and transaction enhancement services and manuals and publications rebates and incentives which are paid to customers and merchants to encourage issuance and acceptance of our cards are recorded as contrarevenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—revenues” in item 7 of this report 

generally we process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states the united kingdom canada brazil and australia we process substantially all crossborder transactions with mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions and earn crossborder revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies operations fees for offline debit transactions which are generally signaturebased debit transactions are priced similar to credit transactions operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions while crossborder offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than crossborder online debit transactions 

assessments are primarily based on a customer’s gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the nature of the transactions that generate gdv and by region most of our assessment rates for issuers are tiered and rates decrease when a customer meets incremental volume hurdles we generally assess at higher rates for crossborder volumes compared to domestic volumes we also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals credit and offline debit transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions in addition we may from time to time introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs 

we generate a significant amount of revenue from processing crossborder transactions and from currency conversion on a global scale we have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies for example we may process a transaction in a merchant’s local currency however the charge for the transaction would appear on the cardholder’s statement in the cardholder’s home currency mastercard generally uses a wholesale rate increased by a certain percentage or a governmentmandated rate to convert transactions in other currencies into us dollars revenues from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions fluctuate with crossborder travel see “risk factors—business risks— a significant portion of the revenue we earn outside the united states is generated from crossborder transactions and a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability” in item 1a of this report 

authorization clearing and settlement  we facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of the transactions described above and similar transactions through our proprietary worldwide computer and telecommunications network 

  

authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is approved by the issuer or in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions mastercard’s network provides for the transmission of authorization requests and results among issuers acquirers and other transaction processors or networks our authorization network provides an intelligent system architecture that combines both centralized and peertopeer distributed transaction processing this infrastructure is designed to automatically adapt to the individual needs of each transaction blending the speed and redundancy of peertopeer networking with the realtime availability of valueadded services provided from a central site we believe our system is unique providing distinct advantages over networks deployed by our competitors and enabling us to provide our customers around the world with quality scalable processing that is consistently reliable secure and available our rules which may vary across regions establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 

clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems 

once transactions have been authorized and cleared mastercard provides services in connection with the settlement of the transactions—that is the exchange of funds along with associated fees settlement is provided through our settlement account management system once clearing is completed a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position the actual exchange of funds takes place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer and approved by mastercard and a settlement bank chosen by mastercard customer settlement occurs in us dollars or in a limited number of other currencies in accordance with our established rules 

credit and offline debit transaction processing  our transaction processing services are managed principally through our global technology and operations center in o’fallon missouri a stateoftheart worldwide network control facility with more than 52000 square feet of white computer room environment our core processing systems are large and highly scalable we typically operate at about 80 capacity during peak periods and we can substantially scale this capacity upon demand mastercard processes transactions in more than 160 currencies from approximately 210 countries and territories 

credit and offline debit transactions using mastercardbranded cards are generally cleared through our centralized processing system known as the global clearing management system “gcms” and the related information is typically routed among customers via our data transport network which we refer to as banknet ®  both gcms and banknet have benefited from significant investments made during a fiveyear 160 million system enhancement strategy completed in 2003 as well as from ongoing investments since 1997 our virtual private network has significantly reduced transaction processing times and enhanced data security for our customers in our systems transactions benefit from our ability to combine both centralized and peertopeer distributed transaction processing this infrastructure is designed to automatically adapt to the individual needs of each transaction blending the speed and redundancy of peertopeer networking with the realtime availability of valueadded services provided from a central site this system enables us to provide our customers around the world with quality scalable processing that is consistently reliable secure and available 

gcms has helped us to improve our timetomarket in introducing new programs and services more importantly using gcms we can partner with our customers to provide valueadded services to merchants and cardholders for example issuers can use gcms to develop promotions for segments of their card portfolios without investing in their own systems development we believe that gcms and our other recent systems enhancements position us well to pursue incremental processing opportunities 

our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year in the event that our main processing facility in o’fallon missouri becomes disabled we have a coprocessing facility in kansas

marketing 

we manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through brand advertising promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives in 2006 we adopted a new corporate brand to reflect our threetiered business model as franchisor processor and advisor and a new corporate vision statement the heart of commerce™ to represent our strategic vision of advancing commerce globally our marketing activities combine advertising sponsorships promotions customer marketing interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated program designed to increase consumer awareness of mastercard and usage of mastercard cards we also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by customizing them in individual countries while maintaining a common global theme our initiatives are designed to build the value of the mastercard brand 

our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility usage and loyalty among cardholders globally our awardwinning “priceless ® ” advertising campaign has run in 51 languages in 110 countries the “priceless” campaign promotes mastercard acceptance and usage benefits that permit cardholders to pay for what they need when they need it it also provides mastercard with a consistent recognizable message that supports our brand positioning in order to promote usage of our cards we sponsor frequent promotions on a regional and national basis often in conjunction with merchants or our customers to engage consumers directly and advance our presence in new digital media we launched pricelesscom in the united states in 2006 and are in the process of rolling out the website in key markets pricelesscom allows consumers to participate in brand programs promotions and merchant offers and provides relevant content on mastercard cards and services 

  

we also seek to drive business for our customers by sponsoring a variety of sporting and entertainment properties in particular mastercard has a significant presence in sports which we believe has broad appeal among consumers we have worldwide partnerships with wellregarded golf events such as the senior british open arnold palmer invitational and both the pga tour and european tour which are intended to help create business building opportunities among a more affluent demographic we have a longstanding relationship with international soccer and have continued this relationship by sponsoring leading events including the union of european football associations “uefa” european championship and the uefa champions league in europe as well as the south american qualifiers mastercard is also the exclusive payments sponsor to major league baseball and the majority of its professional teams we also sponsor the majority of individual national football league teams in professional tennis mastercard made its debut in 2008 as a sponsor of the australian open one of the four grand slam tournaments 

we seek to sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences including a relatively new sponsorship platform in fashion originally launched in our asia pacific region with the intention of raising our brand awareness with affluent consumers we also target a broad audience by providing access to music artists and live performances through wellknown entertainment properties such as jazz at lincoln center in new york soundstage and the brit awards 

acceptance initiatives 

we estimate that as of december 31 2007 cards carrying the mastercard brand were accepted at more than 25 million acceptance locations including 18 million atms and other locations where cash may be obtained information on atm and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publiclyavailable reports of payment industry associations government agencies and independent market analysts in canada and the united states cards bearing the maestro brand mark are accepted at many of these same locations 

merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” and “risk factors—business risks—merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in item 1a of this report we may be required to increase the amount and scope of incentives that we provide to merchants to encourage the acceptance and usage of our cards which may adversely affect our business nevertheless we believe many opportunities exist to enhance our relationships with merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards for example in 2004 we made available directly to merchants our rules that apply to card acceptance and related activities thereby increasing the level of transparency and predictability of our payment system for merchants in 2006 we published the interchange rates applicable to merchants in the united states and in 2007 we introduced a cap on interchange fees on fuel purchases at petroleum retailers as an additional example we have an advisory group which brings together merchants acquirers issuers and processors twice a year to examine the evolution of payments and innovation and to seek to enhance the experience for merchants and consumers at the point of interaction for a retail sales transaction furthermore we also hold meetings with merchant advisory groups that have been established in key global markets including the united states canada and australia and we continue to strengthen our acquirer and merchant sales teams around the world 

we seek to maintain unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded programs by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the categories of merchants that accept cards carrying our brands we are focused on expanding acceptance in electronic and mobile commerce environments in fast throughput 

  

businesses such as fast food restaurants in transportation and in public sector payments such as those involving taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories second we seek to increase the number of payment channels in which mastercard programs are accepted such as by introducing mastercard acceptance in connection with bill payment applications we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make bill payments in a variety of categories—including rent utilities and insurance—with their mastercardbranded cards third we seek to increase usage of our programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis we also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of mastercardbranded programs or indicate a preference for mastercardbranded programs when accepting payments from consumers 

we also support technical initiatives designed to make mastercard card acceptance more attractive for specific merchants such as our quick payment service for fast food restaurants and other merchants where rapid transactions are required in addition mastercard paypass appeals to merchants in fast throughput businesses because it reduces transaction times 

in addition we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner is typically a charity educational or other nonprofit organization 

membership standards 

we establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding membership in mastercard international and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and enforcement 

membership in mastercard international and its affiliates is generally open only to banks and other regulated and supervised financial institutions applicants for membership must meet specified membership eligibility requirements 

in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to perform all obligations required of members licenses provide members with certain rights including access to the network and usage of our brands risk management reviews and antimoney laundering due diligence reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission as well as on existing members all applicants and members must meet the requirements of mastercard’s antimoney laundering program as a condition of our licenses members agree to comply with our bylaws policies rules and operating regulations the “standards” mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce the standards which relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement and member failures to help ensure that members conform to the standards we review card programs proposed by members 

customer risk management 

as a guarantor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2300 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 3300 affiliate debit licensees our estimated gross legal settlement risk exposure for mastercardbranded transactions which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 23 billion as of december 31 2007 principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members approximately 22400 

  

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor principal members’ and affiliate debit licensees’ financial health economic and political operating environments and compliance with our rules and standards if the financial condition of a member or the state of a national economy in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or other mastercard members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of letters of credit and bank guarantees as of december 31 2007 we have members who have posted approximately 2 billion in collateral held for legal settlement exposure for mastercardbranded transactions if a member becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other members we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to our members or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership however mastercard has never terminated a member due to the member’s risk profile in addition to these measures we have also established a 25 billion committed credit facility for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure see “risk factors—business risks—as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations” in item 1a of this report 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payment system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information often resulting from security breaches of systems that inappropriately store cardholder account data see “risk factors—business risks—account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in item 1a of this report fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as electronic commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt or the presence of the card or merchant agent is unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our rules and standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents key compliance programs include merchant audits for high fraud excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions and security compliance including our site data protection program which assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises using the payment card industry pci data security standards our members are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so we can monitor trends and initiate action where appropriate 

our customers are responsible for fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or for their merchants from whom they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help detect fraud including mastercard securecode ®  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique personal code and site data protection in addition we offer several fraud detection programs including our riskfinder ® and expert monitoring products generally we charge our customers fees for these antifraud programs and services 

  

enterprise risk management 

mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” in part 1 item 1a of this report managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability 

we have an enterprise risk management “erm” program created to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of risk our erm program aims to proactively manage and monitor key risks improve corporate governance by providing an independent view of our risk profile enhance decisionmaking processes and business performance through an understanding of our risk tolerance and strengthen business operations by integrating erm principles and creating a more risk aware culture within mastercard 

intellectual property 

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard ®  maestro ® and cirrus ®  through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards contactless mobile electronic commerce security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations 

competition 

mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments and other electronic forms of payment including cardbased payment systems as a result of a global trend electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment and card brands such as mastercard visa american express and discover are benefiting from this displacement however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa including plus electron and interlink american express and jcb among others within the global general purpose card industry visa has significantly greater volume than we do 

outside of the united states some of our competitors such as jcb in japan and china union pay ® have leading positions regulation can also play a role in determining competitive market conditions for example china union pay is the sole domestic processor designated by the chinese government and operates the sole national crossbank bankcard information switch network in china due to local regulation privatelabel cards which can generally be used to make purchases solely at the sponsoring retail store gasoline retailer or another merchant also serve as another form of competition 

in the debit card sector we also encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from atm and pointofsale debit networks in various countries such as visa interlink star ® owned by first data corporation nyce ® owned by metavante corporation and pulse™ owned by discover in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia in addition in many countries outside the united states local debit brands serve as the main brands while our brands are used mostly to enable crossborder transactions which typically represent a small portion of overall transaction volume in addition our financial institution customers could also start their own networks and payment card brands to compete with us 

our competitors include operators of proprietary endtoend payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders such as american express and discover these competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy among other things these 

  

competitors do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers because they typically have direct relationships with both merchants and cardholders interchange fees which are a characteristic of fourparty payments systems such as ours are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business” in item 1a of this report because they do not utilize formal interchange fees operators of endtoend payment networks to date have generally avoided the same regulatory scrutiny and litigation challenges we face and accordingly may enjoy a competitive advantage over fourparty payments systems 

among other companies in our industry visa and discover recently changed their ownership structures which could result in their becoming stronger and more efficient companies within the global payments industry in october 2007 visa completed its plan to restructure its organization through the creation of a new stock corporation owned by its current member financial institutions and in november 2007 filed an initial registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” in connection with a planned initial public offering in july 2007 discover began trading on the new york stock exchange as a publiclytraded company following its spinoff from morgan stanley as publiclyowned companies visa and discover among other changes would have enhanced access to the capital markets would have to operate their respective businesses more transparently and with a greater focus on profitability and are likely to be subject to more public scrutiny and requirements to provide additional disclosures 

in addition ongoing litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry for example under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit us merchants now have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states in addition as a result of the court’s decision in our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our us competitive programs policy our customers may now do business with american express or discover in the united states which could adversely affect our business a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge money have announced that they have begun to issue or will issue american express or discoverbranded cards see “risk factors—business risks—we have repealed our competitive programs policy “cpp” in the united states as a result of a final judgment in our litigation with the us department of justice and our business may suffer as a result” in item 1a in this report finally suits against us have been filed in several state and federal courts because of our currency conversion practices although we have settled these matters if the settlements do not receive final approval the outcome of these lawsuits could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict what the final outcome will be of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings for a description of these and other matters see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we compete intensely with other bankcard associations principally visa for the loyalty of our customers in most countries including the united states financial institutions typically issue both mastercard and visabranded payment cards as a result of this structure known as “duality” we compete with visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs in some countries particularly canada card issuers are “nondual” meaning that they issue either mastercard or visa payment cards but not both issuance of mastercard and visa debit cards is generally nondual in the united states as well due to visa’s historical debit exclusivity rule as a result of the litigation with the us department of justice visa’s debit exclusivity rule is no longer enforceable however visa enacted a bylaw that imposes a fee on its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states if they reduce their visa debit volume by more than 10 as a result of a district court decision visa repealed this bylaw the decision is on appeal and if the decision were overturned and the bylaw were reinstated this bylaw may prevent us from acquiring business from current visa customers in nondual countries we compete with visa for a customer’s entire business 

  

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of rebates and incentives we provide to our customers and merchants as we have in the last several years we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards however our customers can terminate their business agreements with us in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report 

during the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat for mastercard because our business and pricing strategy is intended to enable mastercard to achieve targeted financial performance by providing incentives to customers for incremental business furthermore it contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor which may result in a loss of business for mastercard the continued consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which mastercard has a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms this pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report 

we face competition with respect to particular segments of the payment card industry in the united states for example offline transactions on mastercardbranded cards account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than the share of all credit or charge transactions represented by mastercard credit or charge cards some of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do see “risk factors—business risks—if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth” in item 1a of this report in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by the tendency among us consumers and merchants to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased debit transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions in addition online pinbased transactions are more likely to be processed by other domestic atmdebit pointofsale networks rather than by us 

we also face competition from transaction processors such as first data corporation and total systems some of which are seeking to enhance their networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services certain of these transaction processors could potentially displace mastercard as the provider of these payment processing services 

we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems and payments in electronic commerce and across mobile devices among other services these competitors provide internet currencies that can be used to buy and sell goods online “virtual checking” programs that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for online payments and services that support payments to and from deposit accounts or proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do in mobile commerce we also face competition from established network operators whereas the mastercard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment account as established by their card issuer network operators may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the customer’s monthly bill 

  

we believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive position in the global payments industry are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 government regulation 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in the last several years in particular interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions including the european union see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

furthermore mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers examinations by the ffiec cover areas such as data integrity and data security in recent years the us federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures affecting credit card payment terms and requiring more conservative accounting greater risk management and in some cases higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders in addition mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk 

in addition aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to the federal trade commission’s and the federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue our customers in the united states are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers 

  

in the united states a number of bills were considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues while no legislation was passed in 2007 congress continues to consider these issues which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation in europe the european parliament and council passed the european directive 9546ec the “directive” on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject the directive establishes general principles with regard to the processing of personal data including the legal grounds for processing the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the european economic area and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data 

mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352 of the usa patriot act which applies to certain types of financial institutions including operators of credit card systems section 352 of the usa patriot act requires mastercard to maintain a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and imposed similar requirements on some of our customers our antimoney laundering program must be reasonably designed to prevent our system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities the program must at a minimum include the designation of a compliance officer provide for the training of appropriate personnel regarding antimoney laundering responsibilities as well as incorporate policies procedures and controls to mitigate money laundering risks and be independently audited 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by ofac ofac regulations impose restrictions on financial transactions with cuba burmamyanmar iran and sudan and with persons and entities included in the ofac’s list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the “sdn list” also cuba iran north korea sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in these countries a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries mastercard takes measures to avoid transactions with persons and entities on the sdn list however it is possible that transactions involving persons or entities on the sdn list may be processed through our payment system it is possible that our reputation may suffer due to our financial institutions’ association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

in addition the federal trade commission and the federal banking agencies have issued a number of regulations implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act and other regulations are expected to be issued in 2008 these regulations could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses by increasing costs of issuance andor a decreasing the ability of card issuers to set the price of credit the federal reserve board also proposed a regulation in 2007 to amend regulation z which implements the truth in lending act this regulation will have a significant impact on the disclosures made by our customers and could affect their account terms and business practices 

  

regulators and the us congress have also increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing of credit and their underwriting standards any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or price credit freely could result in reduced amounts of credit available to consumers which could materially and adversely affect our transaction volume and revenues there is also increasing scrutiny of a number of other credit card practices from which many of our customers derive significant revenue by congress and governmental agencies for example in addition to scrutiny of interchange fees the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and other senate and house committees and subcommittees are considering a variety of our customers’ practices including the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit or overdraft fees are determined imposed and disclosed the us congress may also continue to examine possible changes to the bankruptcy code these investigative efforts and other congressional activity could lead to legislation andor regulation that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses and our business if implemented any such legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or to price credit freely could result in reduced revenue and increased costs for our customers reduced amounts of credit available to consumers and therefore a potential reduction of our transaction volume and revenues 

in the us congress there has been increasing scrutiny of interchange fees for example in july 2007 the house judiciary committee’s antitrust task force held a hearing on interchange fees similar hearings were held by the senate judiciary committee in july 2006 and the house energy and commerce committee in february 2006 and additional hearings and proposed legislation are expected in 2008 in addition the us senate permanent subcommittee on investigations recently initiated an investigation of credit card practices that will include consideration of interchange fees the topic of interchange fees has also been raised in other congressional hearings and in other forums including conferences held by a number of federal reserve banks additionally several state legislatures in the united states have considered or proposed interchange legislation 

in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is being implemented through a federal rulemaking process that is underway final rules will be forthcoming at an unspecified date these federal rules once finalized and effective will require us and our customers to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs andor decrease our transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth 

outside of the united states regulators in several other countries have become increasingly interested in payment industry issues some of which have launched official proceedings into payment industry issues see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report

 item 1a risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks 

interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business 

interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank the acquirer to the cardholder bank the issuer in connection with transactions initiated with our payment system’s cards interchange fees including our default interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies certain regulators are seeking to reduce these fees through regulatory action for example 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 interchange fees are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions including brazil colombia mexico south africa singapore and switzerland we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a coordinated approach to interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions in the united states interchange fees have also been the topic of increased congressional and regulatory interest in july 2007 the antitrust task force of the judiciary committee of the us house of representatives held a hearing on interchange fees similar hearings were held by the us senate judiciary committee in july 2006 and the us house energy and commerce committee in february 2006 and additional hearings and proposed legislation are expected in 2008 in addition 

  

the us senate permanent subcommittee on investigations recently initiated an investigation of credit card practices that will include consideration of interchange fees also the general topic of interchange fees has been raised in other congressional hearings and other forums including conferences held by a number of federal reserve banks additionally several state legislatures in the united states have considered or proposed interchange legislation 

in addition merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees through litigation in the united states merchants have filed approximately fifty classaction or individual suits alleging that our interchange fees violate federal antitrust laws these suits allege among other things that our purported setting of interchange fees constitutes horizontal pricefixing between and among mastercard visa and their member banks in violation of section 1 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade the suits seek treble damages in an unspecified amount attorney’s fees and injunctive relief see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face 

if issuers cannot collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fees they may be unable to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in our fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge if we are less successful than visa in defending interchange fees we could also be competitively disadvantaged against visa if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees such regulation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business in addition this could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

if we are found liable in any of the cases brought by american express or discover we may be forced to pay substantial damages 

in 1998 the us department of justice filed suit against mastercard international visa usa inc and visa international corp in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that certain aspects of the governance of mastercard and visa were unlawful and that our cpp and a similar visa bylaw provision that prohibited financial institutions participating in the respective systems from issuing competing proprietary payment cards such as american express or discover acted to restrain competition although we were successful in defending the relevant aspects of our governance structure at trial the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that our cpp and visa’s bylaw constituted unlawful restraints of trade under us federal antitrust laws based on the final judgment in this matter our cpp became unenforceable in october 2004 and was subsequently repealed thereafter discover and american express each filed suit against us visa usa inc and visa international services association alleging that the cpp and visa’s bylaw provision caused each injury by unlawfully restraining trade under us federal antitrust laws the american express complaint named a number of member banks as codefendants in connection with their respective claims american express and discover each requested that the district court give collateral estoppel effect to its findings in its judgment in the department of justice litigation although the district court has denied that request early in the litigation the court indicated that american express and discover may refile a motion for collateral estoppel after further proceedings those motions were filed on february 15 2008 and briefing is scheduled to be completed by april 21 2008 if the court were to give effect to collateral estoppel on one or more issues in the future then significant elements of plaintiffs’ claims would be established thereby making it more likely that we would be found liable and making the possibility of an award of damages that much more likely in the event all issues are subsequently decided against mastercard in dispositive motions during the 

  

course of the litigation then there is the possibility that the sole issue remaining at trial will be whether a damage award is appropriate and if so what the amount of damages should be 

in november 2007 visa and the remaining bank defendants reached an agreement with american express to settle the claims brought against them by american express as a result mastercard is the sole remaining defendant in the american express action 

at this time it is not possible to ascertain the amount of any potential liability related to these matters american express and discover have each submitted confidential expert reports purporting to demonstrate that they have incurred damages in the billions of dollars although mastercard has submitted confidential expert reports countering the damages arguments made in american express’ and discover’s reports and concluding that damages are negative moreover because these actions have been brought under us federal antitrust laws any actual damages would be trebled and we may be subject to joint and several liability or liability for the acts of all named defendants if liability is established which could significantly increase the adverse effect upon us of any adverse judgment american express has publicly stated that it intends to seek full recovery from mastercard for all of the damages it alleges it sustained if american express is able to prove a conspiracy between mastercard and visa or is able to establish that all damages are attributable to mastercard’s conduct it would be entitled to recover the full measure of its damages from mastercard if we are unsuccessful in defending against either or both of these lawsuits the ultimate liability for mastercard could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in the quarterly and annual period when such losses are recognized such liability could also have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position and in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent similarly if we decide to settle either or both lawsuits or if we establish provisions in connection with them which will depend on our continuing reconsideration of the progress of the litigation such a settlement or the establishment of such provisions could also have a material adverse effect see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected” and see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information 

if the settlements of our currency conversion cases are not ultimately approved and we are unsuccessful in any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we generate significant revenue from processing crossborder currency transactions for members however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in particular a trial judge in california found that our currency conversion practice is deceptive under california state law and ordered us to mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to california cardholders the decision was reversed on appeal on grounds that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue his claims in addition we have been served with similar complaints in several state courts seeking to in effect extend the judge’s decision to mastercard cardholders outside of california we have succeeded in having several of these cases dismissed or transferred to the us district court for the southern district of new york and combined with putative federal class actions the class actions allege that our currency conversion practices violate federal antitrust laws on july 20 2006 mastercard and the other defendants in the federal class actions entered into agreements settling those cases and related matters as well as the california state case pursuant to the settlement agreements mastercard has paid 72 million to be used for defendants’ settlement fund to settle the federal actions and 13 million to settle the california case the settlement agreements are subject to final approval by the court and resolution of all appeals if final approval of the settlement agreements is not granted and we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits or the state currency conversion cases we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards in another country or may be required to modify our currency conversion practices see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

  

if we are found liable in any of the other litigations that have been brought against us or in any other litigation to which we may be subject in the future we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

there are currently actions against mastercard international in california west virginia and new mexico state courts the complaints are brought under state unfair competition statutes on behalf of putative classes of consumers the claims in these actions mirror the allegations made in the us merchant lawsuit which was brought on behalf of a class of us merchants against mastercard international and visa and alleged among other things that our “honor all cards” rule and a similar visa rule which required merchants who accept mastercard cards to accept for payment every validly presented mastercard card constituted an illegal tying arrangement in violation of section 1 of the sherman act the plaintiffs also asserted that we and visa conspired to monopolize what they characterized as the pointofsale debit card market in june 2003 mastercard international entered into a settlement agreement that resolved the us merchant lawsuit the settlement agreement required among other things that we pay 125 million in 2003 and 100 million annually each december from 2004 through 2012 see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a description of the settlement agreement the putative consumer class actions are not covered by the terms of the june 2003 settlement agreement these actions assert that merchants faced with excessive merchant discount fees have passed these overcharges to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold none of these actions specify the amount of damages sought although mastercard has entered into a settlement agreement for the action in west virginia that is subject to court approval see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we may also be sued in the future in the united states or in other jurisdictions by our customers merchants or consumers for substantial damages or injunctive relief in connection with our business practices if we are unsuccessful in our defense against the consumer class actions or any other litigation we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices and pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

except with respect to currency conversion litigations and the west virginia consumer state action we have not established reserves for any of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future we may determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any of our legal proceedings is required including charges related to legal fees in addition we may be required to record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of reserves that we have previously recorded such charges particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent a plaintiff in one of our antitrust litigations has asserted in a written communication that the damages it believes it is likely to recover in its lawsuit will exceed our capital and ability to pay and that the damages in such lawsuit and in our other pending litigations are likely to be in the billions of dollars before trebling see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

  

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report these limitations and any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the payments industry is generally the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may impose costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and lead to decreased transaction volumes through our systems 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular our customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently mastercard is at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in the last several years for example in 2002 mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act which has required our customers and us to create and implement comprehensive antimoney laundering programs increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by ofac ofac regulations impose restrictions on financial transactions with cuba burmamyanmar iran and sudan and with persons and entities included on the sdn list also cuba iran north korea sudan and syria have been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in these countries a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries mastercard takes measures to avoid transactions with persons and entities on the sdn list however it is possible that transactions involving persons or entities on the sdn list may be processed through our payment system it is possible that our reputation may suffer due to some of our financial institutions’ association with these countries or the existence of any such transactions which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

in addition the federal trade commission and the federal banking agencies have issued a number of regulations implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act and other regulations are expected to be issued in 2008 these regulations could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses by increasing costs of issuance andor decreasing the ability of card issuers to set the price of credit the federal reserve board also proposed a regulation in 2007 to amend regulation z which implements the truth in lending act this regulation will have a significant impact on the disclosures made by our customers and could affect their account terms and business practices regulators and the us congress have also increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing of credit and their underwriting standards any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or price credit freely could result in reduced amounts of credit available to consumers which could materially and adversely affect our transaction volume and revenues 

  

there is also increasing scrutiny of a number of other credit card practices from which many of our customers derive significant revenue by congress and governmental agencies for example in addition to scrutiny of interchange fees the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and other senate and house committees and subcommittees are considering a variety of our customers’ practices including the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit or overdraft fees are determined imposed and disclosed the us congress may also continue to examine possible changes to the bankruptcy code these investigative efforts and other congressional activity could lead to legislation andor regulation that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses and our business if implemented any such legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or to price credit freely could result in reduced revenue and increased costs for our customers reduced amounts of credit available to consumers and therefore a potential reduction of our transaction volume and revenues 

in october 2006 the us congress enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and is being implemented through a federal rulemaking process that is underway final rules will be forthcoming at an unspecified date these federal rules once finalized and effective will require us and our customers to implement compliance programs that could increase our costs andor decrease our transaction volumes in addition the us congress continues its consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers some us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth 

increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

our ability to compete effectively against providers of domestic payments services in certain countries could be curtailed by government actions which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

governments in certain countries have acted or could act to provide resources or protection to selected national payment card providers or national payment processing providers to support domestic competitors or to displace us from prevent us from entering into or substantially restrict us from participating in particular geographies our efforts to effect change in countries where our access to the domestic payments segment is limited may not be successful which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand 

  

existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs 

we and our customers are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we and our customers could be negatively impacted by these regulations for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to the federal trade commission’s and the banking agency information safeguard requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguards rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue in the united states a number of bills were considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues while no legislation was passed in 2007 congress continues to consider these issues which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers in addition a number of states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

in europe the european parliament and council have passed the european directive 9546ec on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data this directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject 

regulation of privacy and data use and security in these and other jurisdictions may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment cards which may decrease the number of our cards that they issue any additional regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations which could materially and adversely affect our profitability finally failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business as well as have an impact on our reputation 

business risks 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes enter new segments and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

our strategy is to grow our business by among other things focusing on our customers and entering into customized business agreements with customers around the globe in the future we may not be able to enter into such agreements on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger 

  

and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat to us because our strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in the loss of business for mastercard in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

the continued consolidation in the banking industry whether as a result of an acquisition of a substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with a strong relationship with a competitor or the combination of two institutions with which mastercard has a strong relationship would also produce a smaller number of large customers which could increase the bargaining power of our customers this consolidation could lead to lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers any such lower prices andor more favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

in addition changing regulatory environments in certain regions may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues 

our revenue would decline significantly if we lose one or more of our most significant customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2007 the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 12 billion or 31 of total revenue none of our customers generate 10 of total revenue loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard for instance as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant 

  

lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see notes 18 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report in addition some large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business” the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings large merchants are also able to negotiate pricing discounts and other incentives from us and our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments and other electronic forms of payment including cardbased and noncardbased payment systems see “business—competition” in item 1 of this report some of our traditional competitors as well as alternative payment service providers have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have if we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats our competitors may also more effectively introduce innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth as a result our revenue or profitability could decline we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems and payments in electronic commerce and for mobile devices a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

a significant portion of the revenue we earn outside the united states is generated from crossborder transactions and a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from fees for processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions in addition we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with cross border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency in particular international geopolitical economic and other conditions including the threat of terrorism and outbreak of diseases could cause a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we have repealed our cpp in the united states as a result of a final judgment in our litigation with the us department of justice and our business may suffer as a result 

based on a final judgment of our litigation with the us department of justice in october 2004 our cpp in the united states which prohibited financial institutions participating in our system from issuing competing proprietary payment cards became unenforceable and was subsequently repealed see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report as a result our issuers are now permitted to issue general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network such as american express or discover this may cause our customers to issue fewer cards with our brand and to 

  

enter into arrangements with our competitors to issue cards thereby reducing the volume of transactions that we process and decreasing our revenues a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge money have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards accordingly the repeal of the cpp may have a material adverse affect on our business revenue and profitability 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues 

certain financial institutions have exclusive or near exclusive relationships with our competitors to issue payment cards and these relationships may make it difficult or costprohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with them to increase our revenues in addition these financial institutions may be more successful and may grow faster than the financial institutions that primarily issue our cards which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquirers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our central processing systems because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payment system among regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

  

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the marketplace’s perception of our brands and reputation 

our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholders to mastercardbranded products is highly dependent upon the external perception of our company and industry our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers that impact the perception of our brands adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny such perception and damage to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect to our business 

if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth 

in recent years we believe that industrywide offline and online debit transactions have grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions however in the united states transactions involving our brands account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low penetration in the united states we may not be able to increase our penetration for debit transactions in the united states since many of our competitors have longstanding and strong positions we may also be impacted adversely by the tendency among us consumers and merchants to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because we generally earn less revenue from the latter types of transactions in addition online pinbased transactions are more likely to be processed by other atmdebit pointofsale networks rather than by us 

furthermore in june 2003 following the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit visa enacted a bylaw requiring its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states to pay a socalled “settlement service fee” if these issuers reduce their visa debit volume by more than 10 this bylaw was later modified to clarify that the settlement service fee would only be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of debit cards to mastercard see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a description of our response to this bylaw provision as a result of a district court decision visa repealed this bylaw the decision is on appeal if the decision were overturned and the bylaw were reinstated and visa were therefore permitted to impose this settlement service fee on issuers of debit cards according to this bylaw it would penalize visa members seeking to do debit business with mastercard and would effectively prohibit them from converting their debit card programs to our programs which may prevent us from acquiring business from current visa customers 

any of these factors may inhibit the growth of our debit business which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and overall prospects for future growth 

global economic political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our revenue and profitability 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands also as we are principally domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business prospects and growth 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our customers default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations 

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfall insolvency or other reasons if a 

  

principal member or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard international is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other customers we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not contractually obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations in order to maintain the integrity and acceptance of our brands our estimated gross legal settlement exposure which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 23 billion as of december 31 2007 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 25 billion which could be used to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by any of our largest customers on their peak day concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest customers or of several of our smaller customers may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition for more information on our settlement exposure as of december 31 2007 see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

following our ownership and governance change in may 2006 we no longer have the right to impose special assessments for extraordinary events upon the members of mastercard international which could leave us exposed to significant losses that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

in connection with our ownership and governance change the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of mastercard international were amended to eliminate the right of mastercard international to impose special assessments for extraordinary events upon its members this special assessment right previously allowed mastercard international to recover from its members all or a portion of its expenses and liabilities arising out of extraordinary events such as settlements or judgments in major litigations and catastrophic occurrences that may cause significant risk or damage to mastercard we now bear the expenses and liabilities associated with extraordinary events without recourse to members of mastercard international through a right of assessment accordingly the loss of this special assessment right for extraordinary events leaves us exposed to significant risks and losses from these types of extraordinary events which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire natural or manmade disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism accident or other catastrophic events a disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers such as att bt and orange for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue 

we our customers and other third parties store cardholder account information in connection with payment cards bearing our brands in addition our customers may sponsor thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our cards damage the reputation of our brands and lead to claims against us in 2005 and 2006 there were several highprofile account data compromise events 

  

potentially affecting millions of cardholders in addition in 2007 tjx companies inc which owns several retailers in the united states canada and the uk including tj maxx marshalls homegoods and ajwright stores announced that it suffered an unauthorized intrusion into its computer systems that process and store information related to credit and debit card transactions which affected millions of mastercard visa discover and american express cardholders as a result we may be subject to lawsuits in connection with data security breaches involving payment cards carrying our brands if we are unsuccessful in defending lawsuits involving such data security breaches we may be forced to pay damages which could materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition any damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes revenue and future growth prospects or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeit or other fraud as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance adoption of new technologies or enhanced security requirements and damage to our reputation and financial damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which would reduce our revenue and income 

the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes or by intellectual property rights of third parties our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

we may face increased competition resulting from a change in ownership of our competitors which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 

among other companies in our industry visa and discover recently changed their ownership structures which could result in them becoming stronger and more efficient companies within the global payments industry in october 2007 visa completed its plan to restructure its organization through the creation of a new stock corporation owned by its current member financial institutions and in november 2007 filed an initial registration statement with the sec in connection with a planned initial public offering in july 2007 discover began trading on the new york stock exchange as a publiclytraded company following its spinoff from morgan stanley as publiclyowned companies visa and discover among other changes would have enhanced access to the capital markets and may improve operating results which could be used to enhance their competitive position if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies then use of our programs and products could decline which would have an adverse impact on our revenues 

  

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our international operations 

during 2007 approximately 503 of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may evaluate or make strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies if so we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies furthermore the integration of any acquisition may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we have no present understandings commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 

changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect our benefit plans 

we provide certain retirement benefits to our us employees through the mastercard accumulation plan map a qualified cash balance benefit plan while two us federal circuit courts of appeal have ruled that cash balance pension plans do not violate the age discrimination provisions of erisa various other courts have ruled that such plans are age discriminatory when this issue is resolved definitely we may be required to amend the map and like other us companies with cash balance plans may be exposed to claims from plan participants these developments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure 

future sales of our shares of class a common stock could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future as of february 19 2008 we had 87180453 outstanding shares of class a common stock of which 13496933 shares were owned by the foundation under the terms of the donation the foundation may sell its shares of our class a common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements under canadian tax law the foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 35 of its assets not used in administration of the foundation in qualified charitable disbursements however the foundation has obtained permission from the canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to ten years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the tenyear period despite this permission to defer annual disbursements the foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year in addition the foundation will be permitted to sell all of the remaining shares held by it starting twenty years and eleven months after the consummation of the ipo 

  

in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that holders of our class b common stock would be eligible through “conversion transactions” in amounts and times to be designated by the company to convert their shares of class b common stock into shares of our class a common stock on a oneforone basis for subsequent transfer or sale to an eligible holder subject to annual aggregate and other limits the company completed two such voluntary conversion programs during 2007 after may 31 2010 holders of our class b common stock will have the option to convert all of their shares of class b common stock into shares of class a common stock on a oneforone basis for subsequent sale to the public without aggregate amounts or similar limitations all of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares will be freely tradable without restriction or registration under the securities act by persons other than our affiliates these future sales or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock the class b common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further no member or former member of mastercard international or any operator member or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

the foundation owns 13496933 shares of class a common stock representing as of february 19 2008 approximately 15 of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to the date which is twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements starting on the fourth anniversary of the ipo the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our members the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders 

the holders of our class m common stock have the right to elect up to three of our directors and to approve significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different from those of our other shareholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to obtain the approval of the holders of our class m common stock voting separately as a class for a variety of enumerated actions for example the approval of the holders of our class m common stock is required to make certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation to approve the sale lease or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets to approve the consummation of mergers or consolidations of mastercard or for us to cease to engage in the business of providing core network authorization clearing and settlement services for branded payment card transactions in addition the holders of our class m common stock have the right to elect up to three of our directors because shares of the class m common stock do not have any economic rights the holders of the class m common stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable for the holders of class a common stock or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class a common stock 

certain aspects of our european operations are managed by the european board which has been elected by the european holders of class m common stock and which may reach different decisions than our global board of directors 

certain aspects of our european operations including review of membership applications levying of fines and certain assessments and fees applicable to european members establishment of intraregional operating rules approval of the european annual expense budget disbursing surplus funds and implementation of certain intraregional product and enhancement developments and affinity and cobranding rules are managed by or under the direction of our european board the european board is elected by holders of our class m common stock who have their principal operations in europe and consists of representatives of our european members although our board of directors may through a majority or a twothirds vote depending on the circumstances override decisions or temporarily assume any authority granted to the european board the european board may reach different decisions than our board of directors would have reached on the same matter 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our holders of class a common stock and class b common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

mastercard intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely the payment of dividends is dependent upon our ability to 

  

generate earnings and cash flows so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition settlement guarantees operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs if as a consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make or may have to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2007 mastercard and its subsidiaries owned or leased 71 commercial properties we own our corporate headquarters a threestory 472600 square foot building located in purchase new york there is no outstanding debt on this building our principal technology and operations center is a 528000 square foot leased facility located in o’fallon missouri known as “winghaven” the term of the lease on this facility is 10 years which commenced on august 31 1999 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report our leased properties in the united states are located in 12 states puerto rico and in the district of columbia we also lease and own properties in 43 other countries these facilities primarily consist of corporate and regional offices as well as our operations centers

price range of common stock 

our class a common stock commenced trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ma” on may 25 2006 the following table sets forth the intraday high and low sale prices for our class a common stock from may 25 2006 the date of the company’s ipo and for the two full quarterly periods in 2006 following the company’s ipo and for the four quarterly periods in 2007 as reported by the new york stock exchange at february 19 2008 the company had 38 stockholders of record for its class a common stock we believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our class a common stock is held in “street name” by brokers 

 

 there is currently no established public trading market for our class b common stock or class m common stock there were approximately 923 holders of record of our class b common stock as of february 19 2008 there were approximately 1682 holders of record of our class m common stock as of february 19 2008 

dividend declaration and policy 

during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we paid the following quarterly cash dividends per share on our class a common stock and class b common stock 

 

 in addition on february 11 2008 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 015 per share on our class a common stock and class b common stock for the first quarter of the year ending december 31 2008 also on february 5 2008 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share payable on may 9 2008 to holders of record on april 9 2008 of our class a common stock and class b common stock for the second quarter of the year ending december 31 2008 

  

subject to legally available funds we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition settlement guarantees operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs prior to the ipo we did not pay any cash dividends on our shares of outstanding common stock 

pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation holders of our class m common stock are not entitled to receive dividends 

use of proceeds from the ipo 

in the second quarter of 2006 we used all but 650 million of our net proceeds from the ipo including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to redeem a number of shares of class b common stock from our previous stockholders which was equal to the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock that we issued to investors in the ipo including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares and contributed to the foundation we intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes however we have not determined the amounts of such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to these purposes 

repurchase of equity securities 

on april 10 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of class a common stock in 2007 the “repurchase program” which was completed on october 23 2007 on october 29 2007 our board of directors amended the repurchase program to authorize the company to repurchase an incremental 750 million an aggregate for the entire repurchase program of 125 billion of class a common stock in open market transactions through june 30 2008 during the fourth quarter of 2007 mastercard repurchased a total of approximately 19 million shares for an aggregate of 3234 million and at an average price of 16881 per share of class a common stock the company’s activity during the fourth quarter of 2007 consisted of open market share repurchases and is summarized in the following table 

 

  

   




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” and mastercard europe sprl “mastercard europe” together “mastercard” or the “company” included elsewhere in this report 

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” pursuant to the requirements of regulation g portions of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include a comparison of certain nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap the company’s management believes that the nongaap financial measures discussed below facilitate an understanding of our results of operations and provide a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods specifically we are presenting operating expenses excluding 

 

  

  

 see “—operating expenses” for a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding the special items above to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

similarly we present the effective tax rate with and without the impact of the stock donation to the mastercard foundation the “foundation” for the year ended december 31 2006 because the stock donation to the foundation is a noncash and nonrecurring item that was completed in conjunction with our change in governance and ownership structure implemented during the second quarter of 2006 we believe the effective tax rate without the impact of the stock donation to the foundation is more meaningful to investors in understanding our financial results including comparability to the same periods in 2007 and 2005 

finally we are presenting in 2007 and 2006 gross assessments growth excluding a reclassification from assessments to currency conversion and crossborder revenues and sepa pricing increases we believe the gross assessments growth rate excluding these items is representative of the core growth in these revenues

we are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers’ credit debit and related payment programs we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic™ maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our customers as part of managing these brands we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

  

we recorded net income of 11 billion or 800 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2007 versus 50 million or 037 per diluted share in 2006 our liquidity and capital position remain strong with 30 billion in cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities and 30 billion in stockholders’ equity as of december 31 2007 

net revenue growth of 223 in 2007 was primarily due to increased transactions and volumes the foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the brazilian real against the dollar accounted for 31 of the growth while approximately 2 of our 2007 net revenue growth was due to the impact of pricing adjustments 

operating expenses decreased 44 in 2007 this decrease in operating expenses includes a 18 favorable impact for the foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the brazilian real against the us dollar excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in “—operating expenses” operating expenses increased 104 in the year ended december 31 2007 in 2007 the increase in operating expenses excluding the impact of special items was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses to support our customer focused strategy our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 728 in 2007 versus 931 in 2006 excluding the impact of special items our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues in 2007 declined to 727 from 805 in 2006 

other income in 2007 includes realized gains of approximately 391 million for the partial sale of an availableforsale security redecard sa and 90 million from the organization that operates the world cup soccer events in resolution of all outstanding disputes pertaining to our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 world cup soccer events see “—other income expense” 

regulatory actions litigation consolidation within the banking industry and the growing power of merchants may lead us to change our pricing arrangements reducing our overall revenues and having an adverse impact on our business see “item 1a—risk factors” of this report for these and other risks facing our business 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business our strategy is to continue our growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as premiumaffluent and contactless cards commercial payments and debit enhancing our merchant relationships growing acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world we are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs marketing product development technology processing consulting and information services by investing in strong customer relationships over the longterm we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in most regions except europe assessments are calculated based on local currency volume converted to us dollar volume using average exchange rates for the related assessment period in europe the local currency volumes are converted to the euro as a result assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar or euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period in 2007 and 2006 gross dollar volume “gdv” on a us dollar converted basis increased 184 and 161 respectively exceeding local currency gdv growth of 144 and 154 compared to the same periods in the prior year indicating the weakening of the us dollar 

we are especially impacted by the movements of the euro and the brazilian real relative to the us dollar since the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real the strengthening or devaluation of the 

  

us dollar against the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the us dollar the impact on operating results for each of the years stated is summarized as follows 

 

 revenues 

we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments gdv includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage purchases cash disbursements balance transfers and convenience checks on mastercardbranded cards our pricing for transactions and services is complex each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided we review our pricing and implement changes on an ongoing basis in addition standard pricing varies by region and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers we earned approximately 738 731 and 661 of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 262 269 and 339 of our net revenues from net assessments in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively approximately 33 of the shift to operation fees from assessments in 2006 was due to the restructuring of our currency conversion pricing in april 2006 

operations fees are typically transactionbased but may also be volume based and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers mastercard’s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders’ banks acquirers the merchants’ banks merchants and cardholders operations fees are charged to issuers acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services specific programs to promote mastercardbranded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses the significant components of operations fees are as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 generally we process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states the united kingdom canada brazil and australia we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions and earn crossborder revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies operations fees for offline debit transactions which are generally signaturebased debit transactions are priced similar to credit transactions operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions while crossborder offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than crossborder online debit transactions 

assessments are primarily based on a customer’s gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate gdv most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles these assessment rates also vary by the type of transaction we generally assess at higher rates for crossborder volumes compared to domestic volumes we also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals credit and offline debit transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions in addition from time to time we may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs assessments that are based on quarterly gdv are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance 

in 2007 and 2006 gross revenues grew 204 and 195 respectively a component of our revenue growth in each year is attributable to pricing changes our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives accordingly we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide gdv and other performance 

  

based support incentives rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 246 257 and 216 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs rebates and incentives increased 173 million or 150 and 341 million or 421 in 2007 and 2006 respectively these increases reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry the continued consolidation and globalization of our customers the growing power of merchants and the impact of pricing changes 

the united states remains our largest geographic market based on revenues revenue generated in the united states was approximately 497 523 and 548 of total revenues in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period certain nonus economies have experienced stronger growth than the us economy accordingly some nonus revenues grew at a faster rate than us revenues in 2007 and 2006 the growth was not specifically related to any one region in which we do business 

our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors in particular a significant portion of our revenues are dependent on international travel patterns which can vary with the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies or the impact of specific events such as terrorist attacks our revenues can also be impacted by a number of factors related to consumer behavior including consumer confidence in the mastercard brand 

results of operations 

 

   

   

    operations fees 

the significant components in operations fees are as follows 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

     

 assessments 

assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers’ gdv the components of assessments are as follows 

 

   

gdv growth was 144 and 154 in 2007 and 2006 respectively when measured in local currency terms and 184 and 161 when measured on a us dollar converted basis in 2007 gross assessments also grew due to an increase in assessable volumes for market development programs in specific countries within europe in 2006 a portion of our gdv growth related to an increase in online debit transactions which are priced at a lower assessment rate compared to credit and offline debit transactions accordingly gross assessments in 2006 increased at a lower rate than gdv in addition revenue growth rates in 2007 and 2006 were impacted by a reclassification of 31 million and 108 million respectively from assessments to currency conversion and crossborder revenues offset by 12 million and 33 million respectively in pricing increases related to our sepa pricing changes the increase in 2007 and 2006 gross assessments excluding the net impact of the reclassifications and increase from the april 2006 pricing modifications from each period would have been 113 and 143 respectively 

rebates and incentives are primarily based on gdv but may also contain components for the issuance of new cards launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs the rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 482 499 and 389 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively as gross assessments increase at a faster rate than rebates and incentives the ratio of rebates and incentives to gross assessments will decline nongdv performancebased incentives vary depending on the agreement terms and the timing of our customer’s performance accordingly our incentives for nongdv performance metrics such as the issuance of new cards the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs impact the relationship between gross assessments and net assessments in 2007 2006 and 2005 rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments fluctuated with the timing and structure of pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development us merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements contributions to the foundation and depreciation and amortization expenses in 2007 there was a decrease in operating expenses of 137 million or 44 compared to 2006 as described above the following table shows a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding special items and as adjusted to the most directly comparable gaap measure which management believes creates a more meaningful comparison of results between periods 

 

  

   

in 2006 there was an increase in operating expenses of 552 million or 217 compared to 2005 during 2005 operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 866 including two special items of litigation settlements for 75 million and 19 million for an adjustment to reflect our accounting methodology change for cashbased executive incentive plans excluding the two special items in 2005 operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 834 and the as adjusted increase in operating expenses was 227 million or 92 in 2006 compared to 2005 

general and administrative 

the major components of general and administrative expenses are as follows 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 advertising and marketing 

our approach to advertising and marketing activities combines advertising sponsorships promotions interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated program designed to increase mastercard brand awarenesspreference and usage of mastercard cards advertising and market development expenses increased 

  

28 million or 27 in 2007 and increased 44 million or 43 in 2006 the growth in 2007 primarily related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation of the euro to the us dollar in addition in 2007 and 2006 the timing of certain advertising and market development expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions we intend to continue to sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences 

in 2007 our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships in 2006 however we allocated a significant amount of resources to support the sponsorship of the 2006 world cup soccer events during 2007 we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 world cup soccer events costs associated with offering cardholder benefits such as insurance and travel assistance for certain programs are included within advertising and marketing in 2007 these costs increased due to new program benefits and an increase in account growth 

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets our marketing initiatives continue to support our customerfocused strategy we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brands and image through advertising and marketing efforts on a global scale we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels 

merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements 

in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded a pretax charge of 721 million 469 million aftertax consisting of i the monetary amount of the us merchant lawsuit settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant lawsuit settlement and iii costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit the 721 million pretax charge amount was an estimate which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors we are also a party to a number of other litigations based upon litigation developments andor settlement negotiations in these other litigations and pursuant to statement of financial standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we recorded reserves for certain of these other litigations in 2006 and 2007 see notes 18 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 total liabilities for the us merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements changed as follows in millions 

 

 contribution expense—foundation 

in may 2006 in conjunction with our initial public offering “ipo” we issued 13496933 shares of our class a common stock as a donation to the foundation which is incorporated in canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our customers the foundation builds on mastercard’s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education understand and utilize technology and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force in addition the foundation supports organizations that provide microfinance programs and services to financially disadvantaged persons and communities to enhance local economies and develop 

  

entrepreneurs in connection with the donation of the class a common stock we recorded an expense of 395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated in both 2007 and 2006 we recorded expenses of 20 million for cash donations we made to the foundation completing our intention at the time of the ipo to donate approximately 40 million in cash to the foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations we may make additional cash contributions to the foundation in the future the cash and stock donations to the foundation are generally not deductible by mastercard for tax purposes as a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations there was a significant increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 2 million and 10 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively these decreases were primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated depreciation and amortization will increase as we continue to invest in leasehold and building improvements data center equipment and capitalized software 

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense and other gains and losses 

 

  

  

   

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were 350 829 and 345 respectively the changes in the effective income tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2006 compared to 2005 primarily related to a nondeductible charitable contribution of shares of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation in 2006 the components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory tax rate of 350 are as follows 

 

 our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 included the impact of the 395 charitable contribution of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation mastercard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of the class a common stock we donated to the foundation under the terms of the contribution to the foundation this contribution is generally not deductible by mastercard for tax purposes accordingly as a result of the significant difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donation the calculation of an effective tax rate for the 2006 period is not meaningful the significant impact on our effective tax rate was as follows 

 

  

   

liquidity 

we need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit at december 31 2007 and 2006 we had 30 billion and 25 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities with which to manage operations in addition we expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital needs for the next twelve months however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in item 1a of this report see also note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 770 million compared to 650 million in 2006 and 273 million in 2005 in 2007 the increase in cash from operations was due to higher net income less the realized pretax gain on redecard sa which is classified as an investing activity offsetting the increase in cash from operations was higher income tax payments including approximately 137 million for taxes relating to the realized gain on redecard sa in 2006 the increase in cash from operations was primarily due to stronger operating performance higher accounts payable and customer and merchant incentive accruals partially offset by higher payments for litigation 

net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 primarily relates to net sales of availableforsale securities including the sale of a significant portion of our redecard sa shares we sold all of our remaining investment redecard sa in the first quarter of 2008 cash provided by investing activities in 2007 was partially offset by cash used for investments in leasehold and building improvements to support increased workforce data center equipment and capitalized software to expand our core functionality including development of a new processing platform in conjunction with this development project we capitalized approximately 32 million of costs during 2007 

net cash used for investing activities in 2006 was primarily due to net purchases of availableforsalesecurities as a result of the additional funds from the ipo proceeds and our investment in capitalized software to support our growing business and strategic initiatives in 2005 cash used in investing activities was not significant 

cash used for financing activities in 2007 primarily relates to the repurchase of approximately 601 million of shares of our class a common stock through a repurchase plan and payment of 74 million in dividends to our shareholders the net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2006 as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of class a common stock to investors in the ipo including the proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of approximately 25 billion which was offset by 18 billion for the redemption of class b common stock and a 12 million dividend payment 

  

under the terms of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement we are required to pay 100 million annually each december through the year 2012 in addition for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we made payments of 14 million 96 million and 15 million respectively for certain other litigation settlements 

on december 6 2007 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share payable on february 11 2008 to holders of record on january 11 2008 of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount payable for this dividend was 20 million as of december 31 2007

on april 27 2007 we extended our committed 3year unsecured 25 billion revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with certain financial institutions for one year the new expiration date of the credit facility is april 27 2010 borrowings under the credit facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers and subject to a limit of 500 million for general corporate purposes the facility fee and borrowing cost are contingent upon our credit rating at our current rating we pay a facility fee of 8 basis points on the total commitment or 2 million annually interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be charged at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin of 37 basis points the libor margin or an alternative base rate a utilization fee of 10 basis points would be charged if outstanding borrowings under the facility exceed 50 of commitments we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility as of december 31 2007 there were no borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2007 or 2006 the majority of the credit facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of mastercard international 

mastercard europe has an additional uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros the interest rate under this facility is euro libor plus 50 basis points per annum for amounts below 100 million euros and euro libor plus 250 basis points for amounts over the 100 million euro limit for drawings in currencies other than the euro interest will be charged at the above margins over the relevant currency base rate there were no material borrowings under this agreement at december 31 2007 or 2006 hsbc bank plc is the lender of this facility and is a customer and member of mastercard international 

our standard  poor’s counterparty credit rating is bbb and our subordinated debt rating is bbb with a stable outlook our access to capital and liquidity has been sufficient with these ratings 

  

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2007 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances 

 

  

      related parties 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2007 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 12 billion or 307 of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may result in lower prices andor more favorable terms for our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report in 

  

addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in item 1a of this report 

seasonality 

during the fourth quarter a combination of factors may cause our quarter profitability to decline while gross revenues can be positively impacted by increases in purchase volume relating to the holiday shopping period rebates and incentives may also increase operating expenses may also be higher than other quarters due to additional advertising and promotions relating to the holiday period plus increases in personnel incentives for exceeding the company’s objectives 

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

 

   

   

   

   

 recent accounting pronouncements

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “sfas 159” sfas 159 allows entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates if the fair value option is elected a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on elected items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date upon initial adoption of this statement an entity is permitted to

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies which have been approved by the board of directors governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2007 as compared to december 31 2006 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is 

  

to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 forward currency contracts against the us dollar were both purchased with notional amounts of 40 million and 35 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 22 million and 17 million respectively based on the year end 2007 and 2006 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a fair value loss valued at 2 million at both december 31 2007 and 2006 

at december 31 2007 there were no forward currency contracts purchased against the euro at december 31 2006 forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased with notional amounts of 121 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 forward currency contracts against the euro were sold with notional amounts of 50 million and 45 million respectively based on the year end 2007 and 2006 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent weakening and strengthening of the euro respectively is estimated to create a fair value loss valued at 6 million and 7 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

at december 31 2007 there were no forward currency contracts purchased against the brazilian real at december 31 2006 forward currency contracts against the brazilian real were purchased with notional amounts of 11 million based on the year end 2006 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the brazilian real is estimated to create a fair value loss valued at 1 million 

at december 31 2007 mastercard’s investment in redecard sa was subject to foreign exchange risk based on the year end 2007 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the brazilian real is estimated to create a loss valued at 9 million 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of nineteen other transaction currencies the remaining 145 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as availableforsale investments with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure based on the net present value of expected future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in interest rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of 23 million and 25 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively our heldtomaturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements 

our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of 80 million of subordinated debt securities a 100 basis point decrease in rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in a fair value loss of 1 million and 2 million for december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement at december 31 2007 and 2006 we had no material borrowings see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

  

equity price risk 

we own trading securities which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan at december 31 2007 the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would be immaterial at december 31 2006 the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value was 1 million to the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense 

at december 31 2007 mastercard’s investment in redecard sa which is classified as an availableforsale security was subject to equity price risk at december 31 2007 the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would be 10 million subsequent to december 31 2007 we sold all of our remaining investment in redecard sa and realized pretax gains net of commissions of approximately 86 million

 item 1 business 

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit debit and related payment programs of nearly 25000 financial institutions who are our customers through our threetiered business model as franchisor processor and advisor we develop and market payment solutions process payment transactions and provide consulting services to our customers and merchants we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic™ maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our customers as part of managing these brands we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing these transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by assessing our customers based on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments 

a typical transaction processed over our system involves four parties in addition to us the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholder’s bank and the acquirer the merchant’s bank consequently the payment system we operate is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system our customers are the financial institutions that act as issuers and acquirers using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient payment method that is accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customer financial institutions to ensure the integrity of our payment system in addition we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands however cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

our business has a global reach and has experienced significant growth gross dollar volume “gdv” on cards carrying the mastercard brand as reported by our customers was approximately 2 trillion in 2006 

  

a 157 increase in us dollar terms over the gdv reported in 2005 in 2006 we processed 161 billion transactions including 32 billion pinbased online transactions a 175 increase over the number of transactions processed in 2005 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as premiumaffluent and contactless cards corporate payments and debit enhancing our merchant relationships maintaining unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities in the european union in connection with the implementation of the single european payment area “sepa” initiative and in certain other countries we are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the longterm we believe that we can increase our volume of business with key customers over time and in support of this strategy we are hiring additional resources and developing sales and other personnel 

we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment accordingly we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny particularly with respect to interchange fees and legal challenges in recent years interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers have been the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish certain interchange rates and collect and remit interchange fees on behalf of our customers entitled to receive them we do not earn revenues for interchange fees however if issuers cannot collect interchange fees or receive reduced interchange fees this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system such as ours lower card issuance lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers might also decide to charge higher fees to cardholders thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge we are also exposed to a variety of significant lawsuits in addition to those relating to interchange fees including federal antitrust claims and claims under state unfair competition statutes see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

mastercard incorporated was incorporated as a delaware stock corporation in may 2001 we conduct our business principally through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” a delaware membership corporation that was formed in november 1966 our financial institution customers are generally principal members of mastercard international who participate directly in mastercard international’s business or affiliate members of mastercard international who participate indirectly in mastercard international’s business through a principal member in may 2006 we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure including the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors who are independent from our financial institution customers and the establishment of a charitable foundation incorporated in canada the mastercard foundation “the foundation” part of this plan included the completion of an initial public offering of a new class of common stock the “ipo” prior to our change in governance and ownership structure the common stock of mastercard incorporated was owned by principal members of mastercard international 

under the new ownership and governance structure our previous stockholders retained a 41 equity interest in the company through ownership of a new nonvoting class b common stock in addition previous stockholders received a single share of class m common stock that has no economic rights but provides certain voting rights including the right to elect up to three of mastercard’s directors but not more than one quarter of the total number of directors and to approve specified significant corporate actions 

  

we also issued 66134989 shares of a new voting class a common stock to public investors through the ipo which closed in may 2006 these public investors hold shares representing approximately 49 of our equity and 83 of our general voting power additional shares of class a common stock representing approximately 10 of our equity and 17 of our voting rights have been issued as a donation to the foundation 

we used all but 650 million of our net proceeds from the ipo including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to redeem a number of shares of class b common stock from our previous stockholders which was equal to the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock that we issued to investors in the ipo including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares and contributed to the foundation we intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges and expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes however we have not determined the amounts of such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to these purposes 

our industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

 

  

  

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 

  

  

 the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard visa american express jcb diners club and discover historically these brands—including mastercard—were principally associated with “pay later” credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets today mastercard and visa cards may be issued in any of the “pay later” “pay now” or “pay before” categories 

“pay now” cards may be further categorized into several subsegments 

 

  

   

  

 regional and domesticlocal pinbased debit brands are the primary brands in many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and the plus and interlink brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall volume 

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a significant portion of all cardbased forms of payment typically private label cards are issued by a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at the issuing merchant’s locations 

payment card transactions are generally characterized as “offline” or “online” offline transactions involve the exchange of transaction data in two discrete messages one for authorization and another for clearing and typically require the cardholder to sign a sales receipt in contrast online transactions only require the exchange of transaction data through a single message with the initial authorization and are typically initiated by entry of a pin at the pos terminal or atm 

payment services 

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services to our customers in connection with these services we also deploy dedicated customer relationship management teams to our key customers to bring them customized solutions built upon our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting services 

processed transactions and gdv 

we generate revenues from the fees we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services these fees are typically transactionbased and include fees for authorization clearing and settlement we also earn revenues by charging our customers assessments based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted by the number of transactions that we process and the use of cards carrying our brands the tables below provide some information regarding gdv which is a key driver of our revenues 

the mastercardbranded gdv table below provides information regarding the gdv for all mastercardbranded card programs excluding cirrus and maestro and mastercard credit and charge card programs in each of our regions for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 growth rates are provided on both a us dollar and local currency basis for the periods indicated gdv represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made and cash disbursements obtained with mastercardbranded cards and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks

   transaction processing 

introduction  we operate a system that links issuers and acquirers around the globe for transaction processing services and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards at millions of merchants worldwide a typical transaction processed over our system involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders’ banks acquirers the merchants’ banks merchants and cardholders the following diagram depicts a typical pointofsale card transaction 

  

in a typical transaction a cardholder a purchases goods or services from a merchant b using a card after the transaction is authorized by the issuer d using our network the acquirer c pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount to the merchant this discount which we refer to as the merchant discount takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee described below the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus any interchange fee and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account our rules generally guarantee the payment of transactions using mastercardbranded cards and certain transactions using cirrus and maestrobranded cards between issuers and acquirers 

for participants in a fourparty payment system the economics of a card transaction to our company vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cash withdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over mastercard’s network or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

a significant portion of the merchant discount is generally paid from the acquirer to the issuer in the form of an interchange fee the balance of the merchant discount is retained by the acquirer to cover its costs and profit margin acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers operational fees and assessments for the services we provide them 

interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and passed to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services which benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers we establish default interchange fees that apply when there are no other interchange fee arrangements in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process however we do not earn revenues from them as noted above interchange fees are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards and are subject to regulatory or legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part 1 item 1a of this report 

mastercard revenue sources  mastercard generates revenues by charging transaction processing and related fees and gdv and cardbased assessments to both issuers and acquirers on an aggregate basis we earned approximately 731 of our revenues in connection with operations fees and approximately 269 of our 

  

revenues in connection with assessments in 2006 in 2005 on an aggregate basis we earned approximately 661 of our revenues in connection with operations fees and approximately 339 of our revenues in connection with assessments operations fees are typically transactionbased and include core authorization clearing and settlement fees crossborder and currency conversion fees switch fees connectivity fees and other operations fees such as acceptance development fees warning bulletins holograms fees for compliance programs and userpay fees for a variety of transaction enhancement services rebates and incentives which are paid to customers and merchants to encourage issuance and acceptance of our cards are recorded as contrarevenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—revenues” in part ii item 7 of this report 

on a global basis we generate a majority of our revenue from issuers however revenue growth can be attributed to both issuers and acquirers the allocation of our revenues between operations fees and assessments and among issuers and acquirers varies across our regions issuers typically pay operations fees and assessments acquirers principally pay assessments on gdv or cards and to a lesser extent certain operations fees 

generally we process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states the united kingdom canada brazil and australia we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions and earn crossborder revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies operations fees for offline debit transactions which are generally signaturebased debit transactions are priced similar to credit transactions operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions while international offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than international online debit transactions 

assessments are calculated based on our customers’ gdv and rates vary by region most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles these rates also vary by the type of transaction we generally assess at higher rates for crossborder volumes compared to domestic volumes we also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals credit and offline debit transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions in addition from time to time we may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs assessments that are based on quarterly gdv are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance 

we generate a significant amount of revenue from processing crossborder transactions and currency conversion on a global scale we have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies for example we can process a transaction in a merchant’s local currency however the charge for the transaction would appear on the cardholder’s statement in the cardholder’s home currency mastercard generally uses a wholesale rate increased by a certain percentage or a governmentmandated rate to convert transactions in foreign currencies into us dollars revenues from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions fluctuate with crossborder travel see “risk factors—business risks—a significant portion of the revenue we earn outside the united states is generated from crossborder transactions and a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability” 

authorization clearing and settlement  we facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of the transactions described above and similar transactions through our proprietary worldwide computer and telecommunications network 

authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is approved by the issuer or in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions mastercard’s network provides for the transmission of authorization requests and results among issuers acquirers and other transaction processors or 

  

networks our rules which may vary across regions establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 

clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central processing systems 

once transactions have been authorized and cleared mastercard provides services in connection with the settlement of the transactions—that is the exchange of funds along with associated fees settlement is provided through our settlement account management system once clearing is completed a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position the actual exchange of funds takes place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer and approved by mastercard and a settlement bank chosen by mastercard customer settlement occurs in us dollars or in a limited number of other selected currencies in accordance with mastercard’s established rules 

credit and offline debit transaction processing  our transaction processing services are managed principally through our global technology and operations center in o’fallon missouri a stateoftheart worldwide network control facility with over 52000 square feet of white computer room environment our core processing systems are large and highly scalable we currently operate at 70 capacity at a peak day and we can substantially scale this capacity upon demand mastercard processes transactions in more than 160 currencies from approximately 210 countries 

mastercardbranded transactions credit and offline debit transactions are generally cleared through our centralized processing system known as the global clearing management system “gcms” and the related information is typically routed among customers via our data transport network which we refer to as banknet ®  both gcms and banknet have benefited from significant investments made during our fiveyear 160 million system enhancement strategy since 1997 our virtual private network has significantly reduced transaction processing times and enhanced data security for our customers in our systems transactions flow between over 1200 endpoints distributed throughout the world rather than through a central location this approach enhances the reliability of mastercard transactions by providing several levels of redundancy 

gcms has helped us to improve our timetomarket in introducing new programs and services more importantly using gcms we can partner with our customers to provide valueadded services to merchants and cardholders for example issuers can use gcms to develop promotions for segments of their card portfolios without investing in their own systems development we believe that gcms and our other recent systems enhancements position us well to pursue incremental processing opportunities 

our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year in the event that our main processing facility in o’fallon missouri becomes disabled we have a coprocessing facility in kansas city missouri our transaction processing systems have redundant power supplies and backup processes to ensure continued operation in the event of a fault we have consistently maintained core systems availability for our global processing systems at a rate in excess of 99 

online debit transaction processing  we also operate the mastercard debit switch “mds” which principally supports the processing of online debit transactions the mds switches financial messages provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs clearing and settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks unlike the authorization and clearing processes described above which involve the exchange of transaction data in two discrete messages one for authorization and again for clearing the mds generally operates as a “single message” system in which clearing occurs simultaneously with the initial authorization request 

in addition to continued investment in the mds mastercard is enhancing its position in online debit transaction processing through a series of initiatives since 2004 mastercard has worked with issuers and 

  

acquirers to increase the routing priority of mastercard’s systems for the processing of pin pointofsale transactions and has begun to establish direct processing connections to major us merchants we continue to explore opportunities to further enhance our debit processing capabilities 

regional transaction processing  we provide transaction processing authorization clearing and settlement services for customers in our europe region through our subsidiary mastercard europe these services allow european customers to facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout europe recently we substantially completed a multiyear technical convergence project to integrate our european systems into our global processing systems in australia we also operate a separate regional processing facility for the asiapacific region this facility processes a majority of the mastercardbranded transaction volumes for australia and new zealand 

outside of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most intracountry as opposed to crossborder transaction activity conducted with mastercard maestro and cirrus cards is authorized cleared andor settled by our customers or other processors without the involvement of our central processing systems we do not earn transaction processing fees for such activity accordingly we derive a significant portion of our nonus revenues from processing crossborder transactions as part of our strategy we are developing and promoting domestic processing solutions for our customers that are designed to capitalize on our significant investments in our global and regional processing systems for example during 2003 mastercard europe began authorizing and clearing transactions for the members of s2 limited which operate an electronic domestic debit card network in the united kingdom under the switch ® brand as part of an agreement to migrate switch branding to maestro by 2007 in brazil we acquired the local debit brand redeshop ® in 2002 the switch migration and redeshop acquisition have resulted in significant increases in our local processing debit volume in the united kingdom and brazil respectively 

customer relationship management 

we are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to take advantage of our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting services for these customers we have implemented an internal process to organize our relationships with our key customers on a global and regional basis to ensure that their priorities are consistently identified and incorporated into mastercard’s project brand processing technology and related strategies to achieve this we undertake an integrated customer planning process with key customers on an ongoing basis through this planning process we seek to capture incremental business opportunities with our customers by enhancing our strategic insights into customer needs and by effectively creating tailored solutions using a variety of our key assets 

we also seek to enter into business agreements with key customers pursuant to which we offer financial incentives and other support benefits to our customers to issue and promote our cards such support may consist of a reduction in volumebased fees for certain customers based on the achievement of gdv targets or other performance metrics we believe that our business agreements with key customers have contributed to our strong volume and revenue growth in recent years 

the pricing terms and duration of the agreements with our customers vary significantly most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” and “—our revenue would decline significantly if we lose one or more of our most significant customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business” in part i item 1a of this report in addition to our key customer agreements we have standard licensing arrangements with all of our customers that permit them to use our trademarks and subject them to the rules governing our payment programs those customers with whom we do not have customized agreements are generally subject to standardized pricing arrangements 

  

mastercard programs 

mastercard offers a wide range of payment solutions to enable our customers to design package and implement programs targeted to the specific needs of their customers our principal payment programs which are facilitated through our brands include consumer credit and debit programs commercial payment solutions and stored value programs our issuer customers determine the competitive features for the cards issued under our programs including interest rates and fees we determine other aspects of our card programs—such as required services and marketing strategy—in order to ensure consistency in connection with these programs 

consumer programs—credit and charge 

overview  mastercard offers a number of consumer credit and charge “pay later” programs that are designed to meet the needs of our customers for the year ended december 31 2006 our consumer credit and charge programs generated approximately 13 trillion in gdv globally representing 66 of our total gdv for the year ended december 31 2006 as of december 31 2006 the mastercard brand mark appeared on approximately 6342 million consumer credit and charge cards worldwide representing 79 growth from december 31 2005 

united states  we offer customized programs to address specific consumer segments our consumer credit programs include standard gold platinum world and world elite mastercard™ cards standard mastercard cards are general purpose credit cards targeted to consumers with basic needs for a credit card gold mastercard cards are targeted to consumers typically requiring a higher line of credit or spending limit and one or more card enhancement services associated with a card platinum mastercard cards are offered with still higher credit lines or spending limits and also provide a full range of card enhancement services such as loyalty reward programs world mastercard ® cards which are aimed at affluent consumers have no preset spending limit and the option to revolve a designated portion of the charges made in 2006 mastercard launched the world elite mastercard card a new card platform for highincome high net worth consumers that offers a mix of travel benefits rewards and global acceptance including personalized travel agency benefits 

international  in addition to the programs offered in the united states mastercard also offers a variety of other consumer card programs in selected markets throughout the world for example mastercard electronic cards offer additional control and risk management features by requiring 100 issuer authorization the mastercard electronic program is designed to curb fraud and control exposure in high risk markets the mastercard unembossed program encourages merchants to submit transactions electronically for authorization while providing cardholders with a global acceptance network mastercard also offers cards for affluent consumers outside of the united states such as the mastercard black™ card and mastercard blanc card in latin america mastercard has also created innovative alternate card forms to help our customers differentiate their programs 

general services  the services provided in connection with all mastercard credit cards and for which we charge issuers include loststolen card reporting emergency card replacement and emergency cash advance optional services such as emergency travel assistance are also available to holders of many mastercard cards these services are generally provided through thirdparty service providers arranged by mastercard including a licensed insurance company retained by mastercard to provide insurance services 

consumer programs—deposit access 

overview  mastercard supports a range of payment solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds on deposit in checking demand deposit and other accounts our deposit access “pay now” programs may be branded with the mastercard maestro andor cirrus marks and can be used to obtain cash in bank branches or at atms in addition mastercard and maestrobranded debit cards may be used to make purchases at the point of sale like our consumer credit programs we support debit 

  

gold mastercard ® programs and debit platinum mastercard ® programs that issuers can offer as premium services to cardholders issuers may also provide enhancement services and loyalty rewards programs in connection with debit cards carrying our brands in recent years we have increased the size of our debit programs in key countries through our acquisition of the redeshop ® brand in brazil in 2002 and through our agreement with s2 limited to shift branding and processing from the switch ® brand to maestro in the united kingdom by 2007 

mastercardbranded debit card programs  we offer mastercardbranded debit card programs in the united states and other countries and we continue to explore opportunities to further enhance our debit processing capabilities 

as a result of the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit in 2003 mastercard has taken a number of actions to modify its mastercardbranded debit card programs in the united states among other things mastercard has adopted rules that allow merchants to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa however us merchants who choose to accept mastercardbranded debit cards must accept all mastercardbranded debit cards 

maestro  maestro is mastercard’s global online debit program based on information from our customers we estimate that at december 31 2006 the maestro brand mark appeared on approximately 675 million cards worldwide representing 130 growth from december 31 2005 based on the same information we also believe that maestro was accepted for purchases at more than 10 million merchant locations globally as of december 31 2006 we believe that our maestro brand has a leading position among online debit brands in many markets throughout the world particularly in europe we believe that the strong presence of maestro in europe will position us well when the sepa initiative which will create a more integrated payment market in europe is implemented we believe that the global acceptance of maestro contributes to the growth of our debit business and adds value to the services that we provide to our customers maestro cards are issued and maestro transactions are processed pursuant to a set of rules and procedures that are separate from the rules applicable to mastercard credit and offline debit transactions 

cirrus  we make the cirrus brand available to customers to provide global cash access for our customers’ proprietary atm cards we believe the cirrus brand provided cash access at more than 1 million participating atms and other locations where cash may be obtained around the globe as of december 31 2006 making it one of the world’s largest cash access brands generally cardholders with cards bearing the mastercard maestro or cirrus logo may use a network atm to access funds on deposit in their accounts if a debit card is used or to obtain a cash advance if a credit card is used typically atm cards contain multiple cash access logos and the cirrus brand enables a transaction which will then be processed by the mds only if there is no regional or domestic cash access brand that is capable of doing it

marketing 

we manage and promote our brands for the benefit of all customers through brand advertising promotional and interactive programs and sponsorship initiatives we strive to have our consumers associate the mastercard brand with “the best way to pay for everything that matters ® ” in 2006 we adopted a new corporate brand to reflect our threetiered business model as franchisor processor and advisor and a new corporate vision statement the heart of commerce™ to represent our strategic vision of advancing commerce globally our marketing activities combine advertising sponsorships promotions customer marketing interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated package designed to increase consumer awareness of mastercard and usage of mastercard cards we also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by customizing them in individual countries while maintaining a common global theme our brandbuilding initiatives are conducted for our benefit as well as for the benefit of our customers 

our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility usage and loyalty among cardholders globally our awardwinning “priceless ® ” advertising campaign launched in the united states in 1997 has run in 50 languages across 108 countries the “priceless” campaign promotes mastercard’s acceptance and usage benefits that permit cardholders to pay for what they need when they need it it also provides mastercard with a consistent recognizable message that supports our brand positioning in order to promote usage of our cards we also sponsor frequent promotions on a regional and national basis often in conjunction with merchants or our customers to engage consumers directly and advance our presence in new digital media we launched pricelesscom in 2006 pricelesscom allows consumers to participate in brand programs including consumer generated priceless experiences promotions and merchant offers and provides relevant content on mastercard cards and services 

we also seek to increase mastercard brand awareness and preference and to encourage card usage and loyalty by sponsoring a variety of sporting and entertainment properties that support the “priceless” campaign mastercard brand positioning and customer marketing priorities in soccer we sponsor leading events including the fifa world cup the union of european football associations “uefa” european championship and the uefa champions league in europe in golf we are a sponsor and the preferred card of the pga tour the champions tour the pga of america the lpga the european pga tour and other events in baseball we are the exclusive payments brand sponsor of major league baseball and have also established separate marketing 

  

and sponsorship arrangements with over half of the major league baseball teams during the 2006 season in football we have established sponsorship arrangements with the majority of the national football league teams mastercard is also the official card and payment system for the national hockey league finally as part of our marketing strategy in family entertainment we have a longterm sponsorship arrangement with certain business units of nbc universal that entitles mastercard to marketing and promotional programs with certain of universal’s motion picture theme park music and video properties 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

we estimate that at december 31 2006 cards carrying the mastercard brand were accepted at over 236 million merchant locations around the world as of the same date we believe that mastercard branded cards were also accepted at approximately 17 million atms and other locations where cash may be obtained information on atm and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publiclyavailable reports of payment industry associations government agencies and independent analysts in canada and the united states 

merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard on the one hand large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” and “risk factors—business risks—merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in part i item 1a of this report in addition we may be required to increase the amount and scope of incentives that we provide to merchants to encourage the acceptance and usage of our cards which may adversely affect our business on the other hand we believe there are many opportunities to enhance our relationships with merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards for example in 2004 we made available directly to merchants our rules that apply to card acceptance and related activities thereby increasing the level of transparency and predictability of our payment system for merchants as an additional example in 2006 we published the interchange rates applicable to merchants in the us and announced a cap on interchange fees on fuel purchases at petroleum retailers effective in april 2007 in an effort to address the concerns of the merchant community and provide merchants with greater transparency into our rates we also hold meetings with merchant advisory groups that have been established in key global markets including the united states canada and australia 

we aim to maintain the unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded programs by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the categories of merchants that accept cards carrying our brands we are presently focused on expanding acceptance in electronic commerce environments in fast throughput businesses such as fast food restaurants in transportation and in public sector payments such as those involving taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories second we seek to increase the number of payment channels where mastercard programs are accepted such as by introducing mastercard acceptance in connection with recurring payment applications we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make recurring bill payments in a variety of categories—including telephone cable utilities and insurance—on their mastercardbranded cards third we seek to increase usage of our programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis we also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive performance incentives for the increased use of mastercardbranded programs or indicate a preference for mastercardbranded programs when accepting payments from consumers 

we also support technical initiatives designed to make mastercard card acceptance more attractive for specific merchants such as our quick payment service for fast food restaurants and other merchants where rapid 

  

transactions are required in addition mastercard paypass appeals to merchants in fast throughput businesses because it reduces transaction times 

in addition we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner is typically a charity educational or similar organization 

membership standards 

we establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding membership in mastercard international and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and enforcement 

membership in mastercard international and its affiliates is generally open only to banks and other regulated and supervised financial institutions applicants for membership must meet specified membership eligibility requirements which may vary between regions 

in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to perform all obligations required of members licenses provide members with certain rights including access to the network and usage of our brands risk management reviews and antimoney laundering due diligence reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission as well as on existing members all applicants and members must meet the requirements of mastercard’s antimoney laundering program as a condition of our licenses members agree to comply with our bylaws policies rules and operating regulations “standards” mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce the standards which relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement member failures and allocation of losses 

to help ensure that members conform to the standards we run a number of compliance programs including reviewing card programs proposed by members and requiring members to undergo an annual audit by an independent certified public accountant or similar examination by a regulatory authority to tailor mastercard’s programs and services to the needs of local markets we have approved a number of variations to the standards applicable to specific regions 

customer risk management 

as a guarantor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2200 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 3300 affiliate debit licensees our estimated gross legal settlement risk exposure for mastercardbranded transactions which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 181 billion as of december 31 2006 principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members approximately 22600 

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor principal members’ and affiliate debit licensees’ financial health economic and political operating environments and compliance with our rules and standards if the financial condition of a member or the state of a national economy in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or other mastercard members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of 

  

letters of credit and bank guarantees as of december 31 2006 we have required our members to post 16 billion in collateral held for legal settlement exposure for mastercardbranded transactions if a member becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other members we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to our members or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership however mastercard has never terminated a member due to the member’s risk profile in addition to these measures we have also established a 25 billion committed credit facility for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure see “risk factors—business risks—as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our members default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations” in part i item 1a of this report 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payment system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information often resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder account data see “risk factors—business risks—account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in part i item 1a of this report fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present such as electronic commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt or the presence of the card or merchant agent is generally unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our rules and standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained by our customers and their agents key compliance programs include merchant audit for high fraud excessive chargebacks and processing of illegal transactions and security compliance including our site data protection program which assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises our members are also required under our rules to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner 

our customers are responsible for fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or the merchants from whom they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help detect fraud including mastercard securecode ®  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique personal code and site data protection in addition we offer several fraud detection programs including our risk finder ® and expert monitoring products generally we charge our customers fees for these antifraud programs and services 

enterprise risk management 

mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” in part 1 item 1a of this report managing risk is an integral component of our business activities and the degree to which we manage risk is vital to our financial condition and profitability 

we have an enterprise risk management “erm” program created to ensure appropriate and comprehensive oversight and management of risk our erm program aims to proactively manage and monitor key risks improve corporate governance by providing an independent view of mastercard’s risk profile enhance decisionmaking processes and business performance through an understanding of our risk tolerance and strengthen business by integrating erm principles and creating a more risk aware culture within mastercard 

  

intellectual property 

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard ®  maestro ® and cirrus ®  through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations 

competition 

mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments and other electronic forms of payment including cardbased payment systems as a result of a global trend in which electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment we have gained market share versus cash and checks in recent years however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide payment volume 

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa including plus electron and interlink american express and jcb among others in specific countries we face significant competition from other competitors such as discovernovus in the united states within the global general purpose card industry visa has significantly greater volume than we do in certain countries other competitors also have leading positions such as jcb in japan our deposit access programs also encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from atm and pointofsale debit networks in various countries such as interlink star nyce and pulse in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia we also compete against businesses that issue their own payment cards such as retail stores and petroleum companies new competitors may also enter our marketplace from time to time for example china union pay has been established as the predominant domestic card acceptance brand in the people’s republic of china and is seeking to expand its acceptance and cash access network internationally our customers could also start their own networks and payment card brands 

our competitors include operators of proprietary endtoend payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders such as american express and discover these competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy among other things these competitors do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers because they typically have direct relationships with both merchants and cardholders interchange fees which are a characteristic of fourparty payments systems such as ours are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business” in part 1 item 1a of this report because they do not utilize formal interchange fees operators of endtoend payment networks to date have generally avoided the same regulatory scrutiny and litigation challenges we face and accordingly may enjoy a competitive advantage over fourparty payments systems 

both visa and discover have recently announced plans to change their ownership structures which could result in them becoming stronger and more efficient companies within the global payments industry in october 2006 visa announced its plan to restructure its organization through the creation of a new stock corporation owned by its current member financial institutions to be followed by an initial public offering within 12 to 18 months in december 2006 morgan stanley announced that it would spinoff its discover card unit as a publiclytraded company in the third quarter of 2007 as publiclyowned companies visa and discover would 

  

have to operate their respective businesses more transparently providing for more public scrutiny and additional disclosures 

in addition ongoing litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry for example under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit us merchants now have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states in addition as a result of the court’s decision in our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our us competitive programs policy our customers may now do business with american express or discover in the united states which could adversely affect our business a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge finance have announced that they have begun to issue or will issue american express or discoverbranded cards see “risk factors—risks related to our business—business risks—we have repealed our competitive programs policy “cpp” in the united states as a result of a final judgment in our litigation with the us department of justice and our business may suffer as a result” in part i item 1a in this report finally we are being sued in several state and federal courts because of our currency conversion practices although we have settled these matters if the settlements do not receive final approval the outcome of these lawsuits could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict what the final outcome will be of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings for a description of these and other matters see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

we compete intensely with other bankcard associations principally visa for the loyalty of our customers in most countries throughout the world including the united states financial institutions typically issue both mastercard and visabranded payment cards as a result of this structure known as “duality” we compete with visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs in some countries particularly canada card issuers are “nondual” meaning that they issue either mastercard or visa payment cards but not both issuance of mastercard and visa debit cards is generally nondual in the united states as well due to visa’s historical debit exclusivity rule as a result of the litigation with the us department of justice visa’s debit exclusivity rule is no longer enforceable however visa enacted a bylaw that imposes a fee on its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states if they reduce their visa debit volume by more than 10 which if enforced may prevent us from acquiring business from current visa customers in nondual countries we compete with visa for a customer’s entire business 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of rebates and incentives we provide to our customers as we have over the past several years we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards however our customers can terminate their business agreements with us in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—risks related to our business—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat for mastercard because our business and pricing strategy is intended to enable mastercard to achieve targeted financial performance by providing incentives to customers for incremental business furthermore it contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor which may result in a loss of business for mastercard the continued consolidation in the banking industry also produces a smaller number of large customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms this pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and 

  

profitability see “risk factors—risks related to our business—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report 

we face competition with respect to particular segments of the payment card industry in the united states for example offline transactions on mastercardbranded cards account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than the share of all credit or charge transactions represented by mastercard credit or charge cards some of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do see “risk factors—risks related to our business—business risks—if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth” in part i item 1a of this report in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signaturebased debit or credit transactions to online pinbased debit transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by other domestic atmdebit pointofsale networks as opposed to us 

we also face competition from transaction processors such as first data corporation and total systems some of which are seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services certain of these transaction processors have significantly greater scale than we do which may provide them with a cost advantage if these processors grow their transaction volumes more quickly than we do their scale advantages over us may accelerate and they could capture some of our core processing business similarly some of our competitors provide currency conversion services at the pointofsale through dynamic currency conversion dynamic currency conversion occurs when a transaction is converted at the individual merchant location in real time from the currency of the merchant into the cardholder’s billing currency thereby bypassing mastercard’s currency conversion processes when mastercard performs currency conversion centrally the transaction is submitted to mastercard in the currency of the merchant and is converted by mastercard into the cardholder’s billing currency the growth of dynamic currency conversion services could reduce the transactions on which we perform currency conversion services which could adversely affect our revenues 

we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems and payments across mobile devices among other things these competitors provide internet currencies that can be used to buy and sell goods online “virtual checking” programs that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for online payments and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do in mobile commerce we also face competition from established network operators whereas the mastercard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment account as established by their card issuer network operators may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the customer’s monthly bill 

we believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive position in the global payments industry are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 government regulation 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in recent years the regulatory environment in which we operate has become increasingly stringent in particular interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

furthermore mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the us federal financial institutions examination council “ffiec” under its authority to examine financial institutions’ technology service providers examinations by the ffiec cover areas such as data integrity and data security in recent years the us federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures affecting credit card payment terms and requiring more conservative accounting greater risk management and in some cases higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders in addition mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk 

in addition aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to the federal trade commission’s and the federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguarding rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate for our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue our customers in the us are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies as part of their compliance with the requirements each of our us customers is expected to have a program in place for responding to unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers 

in the united states during 2005 and 2006 a number of bills were considered by congress and there were several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues congress will likely consider these issues again in 2007 which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation in europe the european parliament and council passed the european directive 9546ec the “directive” on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject the directive establishes general principles with regard to the processing of personal data including the legal grounds for processing the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the european economic area and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data 

mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352 of the usa patriot act which applies to certain types of financial institutions including operators of 

  

credit card systems section 352 of the usa patriot act requires mastercard to maintain a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and imposed similar requirements on some of our customers our antimoney laundering program must be reasonably designed to prevent our system from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities the program must at a minimum include the designation of a compliance officer provide for the training of appropriate personnel regarding antimoney laundering responsibilities as well as incorporate policies procedures and controls to mitigate money laundering risks and be independently audited 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by ofac while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in syria iran sudan north korea or cuba a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries which have each been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states and are subject to ofac restrictions our reputation may suffer due to our association with these countries which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

in addition the federal trade commission and the federal banking agencies are in the process of developing a number of regulations implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses by increasing costs of issuance andor a decreasing the ability of card issuers to set the price of credit 

in the us congress there has been increasing scrutiny of interchange fees for example in february 2006 the house energy and commerce committee held a hearing on interchange fees a similar hearing was held in the senate judiciary committee in july 2006 in addition the us senate permanent subcommittee on investigations recently initiated an investigation of credit card practices that will include consideration of interchange fees the topic of interchange fees has also been raised in other congressional hearings and in other forums including conferences held by a number of federal reserve banks additionally several state legislatures in the us have considered or proposed interchange legislation 

there is also increasing scrutiny of a number of other credit card practices from which many of our customers derive significant revenue by congress and governmental agencies for example in addition to interchange fees the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations will also consider the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit fees are determined imposed and disclosed these investigative efforts and other congressional activity could lead to legislation andor regulation that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses and our business if implemented any such legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or to price credit freely could result in reduced revenue and increased costs for our customers reduced amounts of credit available to consumers and therefore a potential reduction of our transaction volume and revenue 

the us congress recently enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and will be implemented through a federal rulemaking process that is expected to be completed in 2007 these federal rules could require us and our customers to implement new compliance programs that would increase our costs andor decrease our transaction volumes in addition it is expected that the us congress will renew consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us or our customers most us states are considering a variety of 

  

similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly the implementation of recently enacted bankruptcy reform legislation in the united states may also directly affect our customers’ business models for their payment cards business these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenue and revenue growth 

outside of the united states a number of jurisdictions have implemented legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payments systems for example regulators in mexico colombia singapore and malaysia have been given statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of their respective payments systems in the case of singapore and malaysia one of the main policies behind the regulations is to protect the stability of the financial systems of those countries in malaysia there is presently no further requirement other than registration and the supply of information in singapore mastercard does not fall into the ambit of active regulation at present but we may be required to supply information to the regulators in the future 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 4600 persons of which approximately 1500 were employed outside of the united states we consider our relationship with employees to be good

interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank the acquirer to the cardholder bank the issuer in connection with transactions initiated with our payment system’s cards interchange fees including mastercard’s default interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies certain regulators are seeking to reduce these costs through regulatory action for example 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 interchange fees are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions including brazil colombia mexico south africa singapore hungary portugal and switzerland we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a coordinated approach to interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange fees in other jurisdictions in the united states interchange fees have also been the topic of increased congressional and regulatory interest in february 2006 the energy and commerce committee of the us house of representatives held a hearing on interchange fees a similar hearing was held in the us senate judiciary committee in july 2006 and additional hearings are expected in 2007 in addition the us senate permanent subcommittee on investigations recently initiated an investigation of credit card practices that will include consideration of interchange fees also the general topic of interchange fees has been raised in other congressional hearings and other forums including conferences held by a number of federal reserve banks several state legislatures in the united states have considered or proposed interchange legislation finally the merchants payment coalition a coalition representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards is mounting a challenge to interchange fees in the united states by seeking legislative and regulatory intervention 

  

in addition merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees through litigation in the united states merchants have filed approximately fifty classaction or individual suits alleging that our interchange fees violate federal antitrust laws these suits allege among other things that mastercard’s purported setting of interchange fees constitutes horizontal pricefixing between and among mastercard visa and their member banks in violation of section 1 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade the suits seek treble damages in an unspecified amount attorney’s fees and injunctive relief see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more details regarding the allegations contained in these complaints and the status of these proceedings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face 

if issuers cannot collect or are forced to reduce interchange fees they may be unable to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge if we are less successful than visa in defending interchange fees we could also be competitively disadvantaged against visa if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees such regulation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business in addition this could result in mastercard being fined andor having to pay civil damages 

if we are found liable in any of the cases brought by american express or discover we may be forced to pay substantial damages 

in 1998 the us department of justice filed suit against mastercard international visa usa inc and visa international corp in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that certain aspects of the governance of mastercard and visa were unlawful and that mastercard’s competitive programs policy “cpp” and a similar visa bylaw provision that prohibited financial institutions participating in the respective systems from issuing competing proprietary payment cards such as american express or discover acted to restrain competition although we were successful in defending the relevant aspects of our governance structure at trial the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that our cpp and visa’s bylaw constituted unlawful restraints of trade under us federal antitrust laws based on the final judgment in this matter our cpp became unenforceable in october 2004 and was subsequently repealed thereafter discover and american express each filed suit against us visa usa inc and visa international services association alleging that the cpp and visa’s bylaw provision caused each injury by unlawfully restraining trade under us federal antitrust laws discover also alleges that it suffered injury by reason of our rules which required merchants in the united states to accept our debit cards if they accepted other mastercardbranded cards before these rules were modified as part of the us merchant lawsuit described below the american express complaint names a number of member banks as codefendants in connection with their respective claims american express and discover each requested that the district court give collateral estoppel effect to its findings in its judgment in the department of justice litigation although the district court has denied that request at this stage in the litigation the court indicated that american express and discover may refile a motion for collateral estoppel after further proceedings if the court were to give effect to collateral estoppel on one or more issues in the future then significant elements of plaintiffs’ claims would be established thereby making it more likely that we would be found liable and making the possibility of an award of damages that much more likely in the event all issues are subsequently decided against mastercard in dispositive motions during the course of the litigation then there is the possibility that the sole issue remaining at trial will be whether a damage award is appropriate and if so what the amount of damages should be 

neither american express nor discover has specified the amount of damages sought and due to the considerable uncertainty associated with these proceedings it is currently not reasonably possible to estimate the 

  

amount or range of any potential liability each of american express and discover has conveyed their belief that these damages are substantial moreover because these actions have been brought under us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and we may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established which could significantly magnify the adverse effect upon us of any adverse judgment if we are unsuccessful in defending against either or both of these lawsuits the ultimate liability for mastercard could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in the quarterly and annual period when such losses are recognized such liability could also have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position and in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent similarly if we decide to settle either or both lawsuits or if we establish provisions in connection with them which will depend on our continuing reconsideration of the progress of the litigation such a settlement or the establishment of such provisions could also have such a material adverse effect see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected” and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

if the settlements of our currency conversion cases are not ultimately approved and we are unsuccessful in any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we generate significant revenue from processing crossborder currency transactions for members however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in particular a trial judge in california found that our currency conversion practice is deceptive under california state law and ordered us to mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to california cardholders the decision was reversed on appeal on grounds that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue his claims in addition we have been served with similar complaints in several state courts seeking to in effect extend the judge’s decision to mastercard cardholders outside of california we have succeeded in having several of these cases dismissed or transferred to the us district court for the southern district of new york and combined with putative federal class actions the class actions allege that our currency conversion practices violate federal antitrust laws on july 20 2006 mastercard and the other defendants in the federal class actions entered into agreements settling those cases and related matters as well as the california state case pursuant to the settlement agreements mastercard has paid 72 million to be used for defendants’ settlement fund to settle the federal actions and 13 million which is expected to be paid in 2007 to settle the california case the settlement agreements are subject to final approval by the court and resolution of all appeals if final approval of the settlement agreements is not granted and we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits or the state currency conversion cases we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards in another country or may be required to modify our currency conversion practices see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

if we are found liable in any of the other litigations that have been brought against us or in any other litigation to which we may be subject in the future we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

there are currently actions against mastercard international in a number of state courts and the district of columbia in a number of these state courts there are multiple complaints against mastercard international brought under state unfair competition statutes on behalf of putative classes of consumers the claims in these actions mirror the allegations made in the us merchant lawsuit which was brought on behalf of a class of us merchants against mastercard international and visa and alleged among other things that our “honor all cards” rule and a similar visa rule which required merchants who accept mastercard cards to accept for 

  

payment every validly presented mastercard card constituted an illegal tying arrangement in violation of section 1 of the sherman act the plaintiffs also asserted that we and visa conspired to monopolize what they characterized as the pointofsale debit card market in june 2003 mastercard international entered into a settlement agreement that resolved the us merchant lawsuit and contract disputes with certain customers the settlement agreement required among other things that we pay 125 million in 2003 and 100 million annually each december from 2004 through 2012 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of the settlement agreement the putative consumer class actions are not covered by the terms of the june 2003 settlement agreement these actions assert that merchants faced with excessive merchant discount fees have passed these overcharges to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold 

none of the putative consumer class actions specifies the amount of damages sought see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report we may also be sued in the future in the united states or in other jurisdictions by our customers merchants or consumers for substantial damages or injunctive relief in connection with our business practices if we are unsuccessful in our defense against the consumer class actions or any other litigation we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices and pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

except with respect to currency conversion litigations we have not established reserves for any of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future we may determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any of our legal proceedings is required including charges related to legal fees in addition we may be required to record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of reserves that we have previously recorded such charges particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent a plaintiff in one of our antitrust litigations has asserted in a written communication that the damages it believes it is likely to recover in its lawsuit will exceed our capital and ability to pay and that the damages in such lawsuit and in our other pending litigations are likely to be in the billions of dollars before trebling see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report these limitations and any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the payments industry is generally the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may impose costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and lead to decreased transaction volumes through our systems 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular our customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently mastercard is at times affected by such 

  

regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in recent years for example in 2002 mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act which has required our customers and us to create and implement comprehensive antimoney laundering programs increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by the us treasury office of foreign assets control “ofac” while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in syria iran sudan north korea or cuba a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries which have each been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states and are subject to ofac restrictions our reputation may suffer due to our association with these countries which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the value of our stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

in addition the federal trade commission and the federal banking agencies are in the process of developing a number of regulations implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses by increasing costs of issuance andor decreasing the ability of card issuers to set the price of credit regulators and the us congress have also increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing of credit and their underwriting standards any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or price credit freely could result in reduced amounts of credit available to consumers which could materially and adversely affect our transaction volume and revenues 

there is also increasing scrutiny of a number of other credit card practices from which many of our customers derive significant revenue by congress and governmental agencies for example in addition to interchange fees the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations will also consider the methods used to calculate finance charges and allocate payments received from cardholders and the methods by which default interest rates late fees and overthecreditlimit fees are determined imposed and disclosed these investigative efforts and other congressional activity could lead to legislation andor regulation that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses and our business if implemented any such legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to operate their credit card programs or to price credit freely could result in reduced revenue and increased costs for our customers reduced amounts of credit available to consumers and therefore a potential reduction of our transaction volume and revenues 

the us congress recently enacted legislation requiring the coding and blocking of payments for certain types of internet gambling transactions the legislation applies to payment system participants including mastercard and our us customers and will be implemented through a federal rulemaking process that is expected to be completed in 2007 these federal rules could require us and our customers to implement new compliance programs that would increase our costs andor decrease our transaction volumes in addition it is expected that the us congress will renew consideration of regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers most us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our 

  

customers directly the implementation of recently enacted bankruptcy reform legislation in the united states may also directly affect our customers’ business models for their payment cards business these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth 

increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance 

existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy data use andor security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs 

we and our customers are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we and our customers could be negatively impacted by these regulations for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to the federal trade commission’s and the banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act the federal trade commission’s information safeguards rules require us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to our size and complexity the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue in the united states a number of bills were considered by congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address information safeguarding and data breach issues congress will likely consider these issues again in 2007 which could result in legislation that would have an adverse impact on us and our customers in addition a number of states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

in europe the european parliament and council have passed the european directive 9546ec on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject 

regulation of privacy and data use and security in these and other jurisdictions may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment cards which may decrease the number of our cards that they issue any additional regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations which could materially and adversely affect our profitability finally failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business 

business risks 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to issue and promote our cards in order 

  

to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

our strategy is to grow our business by among other things focusing on our key customers and entering into customized business agreements with key customers around the globe in the future we may not be able to enter into such agreements on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat to us because our strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in the loss of business for mastercard in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

the continued consolidation in the banking industry also produces a smaller number of large customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard in addition consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms this pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

in addition changing regulatory environments in certain regions may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues 

our revenue would decline significantly if we lose one or more of our most significant customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2006 the net revenues from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 11 billion or 34 of total 

  

revenue one of our large customers jpmorgan chase bank and its affiliates generated 11 of our consolidated revenue in 2006 jpmorgan chase bank also acts as our us settlement bank and has a significant commitment under our revolving credit facility loss of business from jpmorgan chase bank or any of our other large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard for instance as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report in addition some large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory challenges to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business” the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings large merchants are also able to negotiate pricing discounts and other incentives from us and our customers as a condition to accepting our payment cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments and other electronic forms of payment including cardbased payment systems see “business—competition” in part i item 1 of this report some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats in addition our competitors may be more efficient than we are in introducing innovative programs and service as a result our revenue or profitability could decline 

a significant portion of the revenue we earn outside the united states is generated from crossborder transactions and a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from fees for processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions in addition we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions revenue from processing crossborder and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with cross border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency in particular international geopolitical economic and other conditions including the threat of terrorism and outbreak of diseases such as avian influenza could cause a decline in crossborder business and leisure travel which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  

we have repealed our competitive programs policy “cpp” in the united states as a result of a final judgment in our litigation with the us department of justice and our business may suffer as a result 

based on a final judgment of our litigation with the us department of justice in october 2004 our cpp in the united states which prohibited financial institutions participating in our system from issuing competing proprietary payment cards became unenforceable and was subsequently repealed see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report as a result our issuers are now permitted to issue general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network such as american express or discover this may cause our members to issue fewer cards with our brand and to enter into arrangements with our competitors to issue cards thereby reducing the volume of transactions that we process decreasing our revenues a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge finance have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards accordingly the repeal of the cpp may have a material adverse affect on our business revenue and profitability 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquirers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuer and acquirer customers in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our central processing systems because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands and the perception of our payment system among regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customers’ actions cause significant negative perception of the global payments industry or our brands cardholders may reduce the usage of our programs which could reduce our revenues and profitability 

in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

  

if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth 

in recent years we believe that industrywide offline and online debit transactions have grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions however in the united states we believe that transactions involving our brands account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low penetration in the united states we may not be able to increase our penetration for debit transactions in the united states since many of our competitors have longstanding and strong positions we may also be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by other atmdebit pointofsale networks in addition we generally earn higher revenues on pointofsale purchase transactions than on cash access transactions and on domestic credit and offline debit transactions than on comparable online debit transactions 

furthermore in june 2003 following the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit visa enacted a bylaw requiring its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states to pay a socalled “settlement service fee” if these issuers reduce their debit visa volume by more than 10 this bylaw was later modified to clarify that the settlement service fee would only be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of debit cards to mastercard see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our response to this bylaw provision if visa is permitted to impose this settlement service fee on issuers of debit cards according to this bylaw it would penalize visa members seeking to do debit business with mastercard and would effectively prohibit them from converting their debit card programs to our programs 

any of these factors may inhibit the growth of our debit business which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and overall prospects for future growth 

global economic political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending which may materially and adversely impact our revenue and profitability 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands also as we are principally domiciled in the united states a negative perception of the united states could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business prospects and growth 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our members default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations 

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfall insolvency or other reasons if a principal member or affiliate debit licensee is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other members we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not contractually obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations in order to maintain the integrity and acceptance of our brands our estimated gross legal settlement exposure which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 181 billion as of december 31 2006 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 25 billion which could be used to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our members while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a 

  

settlement failure by any of our largest customers on their peak day concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest customers or of several of our smaller customers may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition for more information on our settlement exposure as of december 31 2006 see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

following our ownership and governance change we no longer have the right to impose special assessments for extraordinary events upon the members of mastercard international which could leave us exposed to significant losses that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

in connection with our ownership and governance change the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of mastercard international were amended to eliminate the right of mastercard international to impose special assessments for extraordinary events upon its members this special assessment right previously allowed mastercard international to recover from its members all or a portion of its expenses and liabilities arising out of extraordinary events such as settlements or judgments in major litigations and catastrophic occurrences that may cause significant risk or damage to mastercard we now bear the expenses and liabilities associated with extraordinary events without recourse to members of mastercard international through a right of assessment accordingly the loss of this special assessment right for extraordinary events leaves us exposed to significant risks and losses from these types of extraordinary events which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced 

our transaction processing systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism accident or other catastrophic events most of our transaction processing systems are controlled by a single facility supported by a separate smaller coprocessing facility a disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers such as att for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue 

we our customers and other third parties store cardholder account information in connection with payment cards bearing our brands in addition our customers may sponsor thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands a breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our cards damage the reputation of our brands and lead to claims against us in 2005 and 2006 there were several highprofile account data compromise events potentially affecting millions of cardholders in addition in 2007 tjx companies inc which owns several retailers including tj maxx marshalls homegoods and ajwright stores announced that it suffered an unauthorized intrusion into its computer systems that process and store information related to credit and debit card transactions which could affect millions of mastercard visa discover and american express cardholders as a result we may be subject to lawsuits in connection with data security breaches involving payment cards carrying our brands if we are unsuccessful in defending lawsuits involving such data security breaches we may 

  

be forced to pay damages which could materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition any damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes revenue and future growth prospects or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards increased fraud levels involving our cards could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance or enhanced security requirements and damage to our reputation and financial damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which would reduce our revenue and income 

the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes or by intellectual property rights of third parties our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

we may face increased competition resulting from a change in ownership of our competitors which could have an adverse impact our revenue 

both visa and discover have recently announced plans to change their ownership structures which could result in them becoming stronger and more efficient companies within the global payments industry in october 2006 visa announced its plan to restructure its organization through the creation of a new stock corporation owned by its current member financial institutions to be followed by an initial public offering within 12 to 18 months in december 2006 morgan stanley announced that it would spinoff its discover card unit as a publiclytraded company in the third quarter of 2007 if we are unable to compete effectively with visa and discover then use of our programs and products could decline which would have an adverse impact on our revenues 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our international operations 

during 2006 approximately 477 of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange 

  

control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may evaluate or make strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any such acquired businesses products or technologies furthermore the integration of any acquisition may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we have no present understandings commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 

changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect our benefit plans 

we provide certain retirement benefits to our us employees through the mastercard accumulation plan map a qualified cash balance benefit plan while two us federal circuit courts of appeal have ruled that cash balance pension plans do not violate the age discrimination provisions of erisa various other courts have ruled that such plans are age discriminatory when this issue is resolved definitely we may be required to amend the map and like other us companies with cash balance plans may be exposed to claims from plan participants these developments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

risks related to our class a common stock and governance structure 

future sales of our shares of class a common stock could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future we currently have 79631983 outstanding shares of class a common stock of which 13496933 shares were donated by mastercard to the foundation under the terms of the donation the foundation may sell its shares of our class a common stock commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo to the extent necessary to comply with charitable disbursement requirements under canadian tax law the foundation is generally required each year to disburse at least 35 of its assets not used in administration of the foundation in qualified charitable disbursements however the foundation has obtained permission from the canadian tax authorities to defer its annual disbursement requirement for up to ten years and meet its total deferred disbursement obligations at the end of the tenyear period despite this permission to defer annual disbursements the foundation may decide to meet its disbursement obligations on an annual basis or to settle previously accumulated obligations during any given year in addition the foundation will be permitted to sell all of the remaining shares held by it starting twenty years and eleven months after the consummation of the ipo 

in addition holders of our class b common stock will commencing on the fourth anniversary of the consummation of the ipo have the option to convert their shares of class b common stock into shares of our class a common stock on a oneforone basis subject to certain rights of first refusal by the other holders of class b common stock in connection with sale of such stock to an eligible holder all of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares will be freely tradable without restriction or registration under the securities act by persons other than our affiliates these future sales or the perception that such sales may occur could depress the market price of our class a common stock 

  

the trading market for our class a common stock could be adversely affected because provisions of our certificate of incorporation will make it in many cases difficult for brokerdealers that are members or affiliates of members of mastercard international to make a market in our class a common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no person who is a member or affiliated with a member of mastercard international which we refer to collectively as “member affiliates” as well as the brokerdealer affiliates of such members will be permitted to beneficially own any shares of class a common stock or certain other voting stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into such stock at any time subject to a limited number of exceptions those exceptions include 1 an underwriter participating in an offering of such securities may beneficially own such securities but only to the extent necessary to facilitate that offering and 2 such a person may beneficially own such securities if those securities are held for the benefit of third parties or in customer or fiduciary accounts in the ordinary course of such person’s business and are held by such person without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of mastercard accordingly no member affiliate is able to trade as a principal in our class a common stock and is restricted in its ability to act as a marketmaker in our class a common stock although member affiliates are able to execute trades as agents for third parties these restrictions on the ability of the member affiliates to engage in marketmaking may adversely affect the trading market for the class a common stock 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a takeover attempt or a change in control 

provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control which could harm our stock price for example subject to limited exceptions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15 of any of the class a common stock the class b common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power or more than 15 of our total voting power further no member or former member of mastercard international or any operator member or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of any such person may beneficially own any share of class a common stock or any other class or series of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors in addition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 a substantial portion of our voting power is held by the foundation which is restricted from selling shares for an extended period of time and therefore may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to the other public stockholders in addition the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation and the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock 

the foundation owns 13496933 shares of class a common stock representing approximately 17 of our general voting power the foundation may not sell or otherwise transfer its shares of class a common stock prior to the date which is twenty years and eleven months following the ipo except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements starting on the fourth anniversary of the ipo the directors of the foundation are required to be independent of us and our members the ownership of class a common stock by the foundation together with the restrictions on transfer could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by the other holders of the class a common stock in addition because the foundation is restricted from selling its shares for an extended period of time it may not have the same interest in short or mediumterm movements in our stock price as or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to our other stockholders 

the holders of our class m common stock have the right to elect up to three of our directors and to approve significant corporate transactions and their interests in our business may be different than our other shareholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to obtain the approval of the holders of our class m common stock voting separately as a class for a variety of enumerated actions for example the approval of the holders of our class m common stock is required to make certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation to approve the sale lease or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets to approve the consummation of mergers or consolidations of mastercard or for us to cease to engage in the business of providing core network authorization clearing and settlement services for branded payment card transactions in addition the holders of our class m common stock have the right to elect up to three of our directors because shares of the class m common stock do not have any economic rights the holders of the class m common stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable for the holders of class a common stock or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of the holders of class a common stock 

certain aspects of our european operations are managed by the european board which has been elected by the european holders of class m common stock and which may reach different decisions than our global board of directors 

certain aspects of our european operations including review of membership applications levying of fines and certain assessments and fees applicable to european members establishment of intraregional operating rules approval of the european annual expense budget disbursing surplus funds and implementation of certain intraregional product and enhancement developments and affinity and cobranding rules are managed by or under the direction of our european board the european board is elected by holders of our class m common stock who have their principal operations in europe and consists of representatives of our european members although our board of directors may through a majority or a twothirds vote depending on the circumstances override decisions or temporarily assume any authority granted to the european board the european board may reach different decisions than our board of directors would have reached on the same matter 

  

our ability to pay regular dividends to our holders of class a common stock and class b common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows 

mastercard intends to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock our board of directors may in its discretion decrease the level of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely the payment of dividends is dependent upon our ability to generate earnings and cash flows so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders however sufficient cash may not be available to pay such dividends payment of future dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition settlement guarantees operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs if as a consequence of these various factors we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows from our business we may not be able to make or may have to reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends on our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock

price range of common stock 

our class a common stock commenced trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “ma” on may 25 2006 the following table sets forth the intraday high and low sale prices for our class a common stock from may 25 2006 and for the two full quarterly periods in 2006 following the company’s ipo as 

  

reported by the new york stock exchange at december 31 2006 the company had 32 stockholders of record for its class a common stock we believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our class a common stock is held in “street name” by brokers 

 

 there is currently no established public trading market for our class b common stock or class m common stock there were approximately 1454 and 1600 holders of record of our class b common stock and class m common stock respectively as of december 31 2006 

dividend declaration and policy 

on november 10 2006 and february 9 2007 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 009 per share on our class a common stock and class b common stock for the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 respectively in addition on february 6 2007 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share payable on may 10 2007 to holders of record on april 9 2007 of our class a common stock and class b common stock subject to legally available funds we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock however the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition settlement guarantees operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs prior to the ipo we did not pay any cash dividends on our shares of outstanding common stock 

pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation holders of our class m common stock are not entitled to receive dividends 

equity compensation plans 

the table below presents information as of december 31 2006 for the mastercard incorporated 2006 long term incentive plan the “long term plan” and the 2006 nonemployee director equity compensation plan the “director plan” both of which have been approved by stockholders mastercard does not have any equity compensation plans that have not been approved by stockholders for a description of the long term plan and the director plan see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

 

    

use of proceeds from the ipo 

in the second quarter of 2006 we used all but 650 million of our net proceeds from the ipo including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to redeem a number of shares of class b common stock from our previous stockholders which was equal to the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock that we issued to investors in the ipo including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares and contributed to the foundation we intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes however we have not determined the amounts of such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to these purposes 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” and mastercard europe sprl “mastercard europe” together “mastercard” or the “company” included elsewhere in this report 

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap pursuant to the requirements of regulation g portions of this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include a comparison of certain nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the companys related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap specifically we are presenting information regarding changes in operating expenses in the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 that exclude a noncash charge associated with the donation of shares of class a common stock to the mastercard foundation the “foundation” charges associated with litigation settlements and a catchup adjustment relating to cash award executive incentive plans “eip” collectively the “special items” as well as gross assessments excluding certain pricing modifications because the companys management believes that exclusion of this information facilitates understanding of our results of operations and provides meaningful comparison of results between periods see “–operating expenses” for a table which provides a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding special items to the most directly comparable gaap measure in addition the paragraph under the table provides operating expenses in 2004 excluding litigation settlements to provide a meaningful comparison between 2005 and 2004 similarly we present the effective tax rate with and without the impact of the stock donation to the mastercard foundation for the year ended december 31 2006 because the stock donation to the foundation is a noncash and nonrecurring item that was completed in conjunction with our change in governance and ownership structure implemented during the second quarter of 2006 the effective tax rate without the impact of the stock donation to the foundation is more meaningful to investors in understanding our financial results including comparability to the same periods in 2005 

overview 

we are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers’ credit debit and related payment programs we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic ™  maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our customers as part of managing these brands we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

  

we successfully completed our initial public offering “ipo” and implemented a new governance and ownership structure during the second quarter of 2006 see “impact of the ipo” below we donated 395 million of our class a common stock and 20 million in cash to the foundation during 2006 we recorded net income of 50 million or 37 per basic and diluted share for the year ended december 31 2006 versus 267 million or 198 per basic and diluted share in 2005 

we achieved doubledigit revenue growth of 132 in 2006 our revenue growth was moderated by a 341 million or 421 increase in rebates and incentives to our customers and merchants in the year ended december 31 2006 the growth in revenues was principally due to increased transactions and volumes and restructuring of currency conversion pricing in april 2006 we restructured our currency conversion pricing by initiating a charge to our issuers and acquirers for all crossborder transactions regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale we also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for performing currency conversion the restructuring of the currency conversion pricing and other less significant pricing modifications in 2006 accounted for approximately 3 of our revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2006 revenue growth was also impacted during the first three months of 2006 by certain other pricing changes that went into effect in april 2005 there was a negligible impact on revenues relating to a slightly unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation of the euro against the dollar 

operating expenses increased 217 in 2006 excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in “—operating expenses” operating expenses increased 92 in the year ended december 31 2006 our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 931 in 2006 versus 866 in 2005 excluding the impact of special items our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved to 805 in 2006 from 834 in 2005 the increase in operating expenses excluding the impact of special items in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses to support our customer focused strategy and to a lesser extent an increase in advertising and marketing expenses to support our brand 

our liquidity and capital position were strong as we had 25 billion in cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities and 24 billion in stockholders’ equity as of december 31 2006 

we believe that the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business our strategy is to continue our growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as corporate premium and debit payments enhancing our merchant relationships maintaining unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the longterm we believe that we can increase our volume of business with key customers over time and in support of this strategy we are continuing to hire additional resources and developing sales and other personnel we intend to expand our role in targeted geographies by among other things pursuing incremental payment processing opportunities in the european region latin american and asiapacific countries 

there is increased regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees and other aspects of the payments industry which could have an adverse impact on our business in addition we face exposure to antitrust and other types of litigation competition and pricing pressure within the global payments industry is increasing due in part to consolidation within the banking sector and the growing power of merchants regulatory actions litigation and pricing pressure may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues see “item 1a – risk factors” of this report for these and other risks facing our business 

  

impact of the ipo 

we completed a plan for a new ownership and governance structure in the second quarter 2006 including the election of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors establishment of an independent charitable foundation and completion of the ipo 

under the new ownership and governance structure our previous stockholders retained a 41 equity interest in the company through ownership of new nonvoting class b common stock in addition previous stockholders received a single share of class m common stock that has no economic rights but provides certain voting rights including the right to approve specified significant corporate actions and to elect up to three members of the mastercard board of directors but not more than one quarter of the total number of directors 

we also issued 66134989 shares of a new voting class a common stock to public investors through the ipo which closed in may 2006 these public investors hold shares representing approximately 49 of our equity and 83 of our general voting power additional shares of class a common stock representing approximately 10 of our equity and 17 of our voting rights have been issued as a donation to the mastercard foundation a charitable foundation incorporated in canada the “foundation” see “contribution expense – foundation” for additional information 

we used all but 650 million of our net proceeds from the ipo including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to redeem a number of shares of class b common stock from our previous stockholders that was equal to the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock that we issued to investors in the ipo including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares and contributed to the foundation we intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes we have not yet determined the specific amounts of all such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to each of these purposes 

in addition in connection with our new ownership and governance structure we have adopted equitybased compensation plans we have converted certain of our existing longterm incentive cash awards into equitybased compensation awards under this plan due to this conversion we are recognizing approximately 10 million of additional personnel expense of which 8 million was recognized in 2006 the remaining personnel expense will be amortized based on the vesting within the plans the human resources and compensation committee of our board of directors also approved 2006 awards under the equitybased longterm incentive plan additionally we granted a onetime restricted stock unit award to nonexecutive management employees of approximately 440 thousand shares in total which resulted in deferred stockbased compensation equal to the fair value of the restricted stock units issued of approximately 17 million which is being amortized over a threeyear vesting period during 2006 we expensed 3 million the remainder of the fair value net of assumed forfeitures is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the awards 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in most regions except europe assessments are calculated based on local currency volume converted to us dollar volume using average exchange rates for the related assessment period in europe the local currency volumes are converted to the euro as a result assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar or euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period in 2006 and 2005 the us dollar weakened as evidenced by a 157 and 143 increase in gross dollar volume “gdv” on a us dollar converted basis respectively exceeded local currency gdv growth of 149 and 130 compared to the same periods in the prior year 

  

we are especially impacted by the movements of the euro relative to the us dollar since the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro the strengthening or devaluation of the us dollar against the euro impacts the translation of mastercard europe’s operating results into us dollar amounts and is summarized as follows 

 

 revenues 

we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments gdv includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage purchases cash disbursements balance transfers and convenience checks on mastercardbranded cards our pricing for transactions and services is complex each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers we earned approximately 731 661 and 631 of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 269 339 and 369 of our net revenues from net assessments in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively approximately 33 of the shift to operation fees from assessments was due to the restructuring of the currency conversion pricing in 2006 

operations fees are typically transactionbased for facilitating the processing of payment transactions and information management among our customers mastercard’s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders’ banks acquirers the merchants’ banks merchants and cardholders operations fees are charged to issuers acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services specific programs to promote mastercardbranded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses the significant components of operations fees are as follows 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 generally we process the majority of mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the united states united kingdom canada brazil and australia we process substantially all crossborder transactions using mastercard maestro and cirrusbranded cards we charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions and earn crossborder revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies operations fees for offline debit transactions which are generally signaturebased debit transactions are priced similar to credit transactions operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions while international offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than international online debit transactions 

assessments are primarily based on gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the nature of the transactions that generate gdv assessment rates vary by region most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles these assessment rates also vary by the type of transaction we generally assess at higher rates for crossborder volumes compared to domestic volumes we also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals credit and offline debit 

  

transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions in addition from time to time the company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs assessments that are based on quarterly gdv are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance 

in 2006 and 2005 gross revenues grew 195 and 211 respectively a component of our revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2006 was the result of restructuring currency conversion pricing in april 2006 revenue growth was also impacted during the first three months of 2006 by certain other pricing changes that went into effect in april 2005 our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives accordingly we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide gdv and other performancebased support incentives rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 257 216 and 162 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively these pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers the growing power of merchants and the impact of restructured pricing the rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs 

the us remains our largest geographic market based on revenues revenue generated in the us was approximately 523 548 and 585 of total revenues in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively no individual country other than the us generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period certain nonus economies have experienced more growth than the us economy accordingly some nonus revenues grew at a faster rate than us revenues in 2006 and 2005 the growth was not specifically related to any one region in which we do business 

our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors in the past our revenues have been impacted by specific events such as the war in iraq the sars outbreak and the september 11 2001 terrorist attack because these events impact travel patterns and related cross border transaction volumes our revenues can also be impacted by a number of factors related to consumer behavior including consumers’ confidence in the mastercard brand 

  

results of operations 

 

  

      

operations fees 

the significant components in operations fees are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 assessments 

assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers’ gdv the components of assessments are as follows 

 

 gdv growth was 149 and 130 in 2006 and 2005 respectively when measured in local currency terms and 157 and 143 when measured on a us dollar converted basis a portion of our gdv growth relates to an increase in online debit transactions which are priced at a lower assessment rate compared to credit and offline debit transactions accordingly assessments are increasing at a lower rate than gdv rebates and incentives provided to customers and merchants reduce assessments growth rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 499 389 and 287 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively rebates and incentives are primarily based on gdv and may also contain fixed components for the issuance of new cards launch of marketing programs or consulting services in 2006 2005 and 2004 the increase in the percentage of rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments was the result of new or revised pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants in addition during 2006 we provided significant incentives to support the conversion of a large payment card program to mastercard 

assessments were also impacted in 2006 by a reclassification of 108 million from assessments to currency conversion and crossborder revenues offset by 33 million in pricing increases related to our sepa pricing changes our gross assessments would have increased 143 in 2006 if these pricing modifications were not made in april 2006 

in 2005 and 2004 assessments grew due to an increase in assessments for marketing programs and other specific purposes we introduced new or increased assessments for market development programs in specific countries or regions within europe and latin america in 2005 offsetting a portion of the increase in assessments was the elimination of an assessment for the promotion of soccer events in the european region which became a component of the core assessment rates in 2005 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development us merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements contributions to the foundation and depreciation and 

  

amortization expenses in 2006 there was an increase in operating expenses of 552 million or 217 compared to 2005 as described above the following table shows a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding special items and as adjusted to the most directly comparable gaap measure which management believes creates a more meaningful comparison of results between periods 

 

   in 2005 there was an increase in operating expenses of 298 million or 133 compared to 2004 during 2004 operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 866 including one special item for litigation settlements of 22 million excluding the impact of litigation settlements in 2004 operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 858 and the as adjusted increase in operating expenses was 225 million or 101 in 2005 from 2004 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel professional fees data processing telecommunications and travel the major components of general and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

   

    

  

  

  

  

 advertising and marketing 

advertising and marketing consists of expenses associated with advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships which promote our brand and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands advertising and market development expenses increased 44 million or 43 in 2006 and increased 92 million or 101 in 2005 mastercard was a sponsor of the 2006 world cup soccer events to fully capitalize on this valuable sponsorship we devoted a significant amount of resources for the sponsorship fee special programming promotions and event marketing during 2006

merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements 

in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded a pretax charge of 721 million 469 million aftertax consisting of i the monetary amount of the us merchant lawsuit settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant lawsuit settlement and iii costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit the 721 million pretax charge amount was an estimate which was 

  

subsequently revised based on the approval of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors we are also a party to a number of currency conversion litigations based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these currency conversion cases and pursuant to statement of financial standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we have recorded reserves in the aggregate amount of 89 million of which 73 million was paid in 2006 in connection with the settlement of certain other litigations we recorded additional reserves of 25 million of which 23 million was paid in 2006 

total liabilities for the us merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements changed as follows in millions 

 

 contribution expense—foundation 

at the time of the ipo we issued 13496933 shares of our class a common stock as a donation to the foundation that is incorporated in canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our members the foundation will build on mastercard’s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education understand and utilize technology and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force in addition the foundation will support organizations that provide microfinance programs and services to financially disadvantaged persons and communities in order to enhance local economies and develop entrepreneurs in connection with the donation of the class a common stock we recorded an expense of 395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated the value of the shares of class a common stock we donated was determined based on the ipo price per share of class a common stock in the ipo less a marketability discount of 25 this marketability discount and the methodology used to quantify it were determined by management in consultation with independent valuation consultants retained by mastercard this discount was calculated based on analyses of prices paid in transactions of restricted stock of publicly held companies and on income based analyses at the time of the ipo we expected to donate approximately 40 million in cash to the foundation over a period of up to four years in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations and we may make additional cash contributions to the foundation during and after this period in 2006 we recorded a 20 million expense for cash donations we made to the foundation under the terms of the contributions to the foundation these donations are generally not deductible by mastercard for tax purposes as a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations there was a significant increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 we also expect to record an expense equal to the value of any cash we donate in the period or periods in which any such donations are made 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 10 million and 13 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively these decreases were primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated 

  

other income expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense and other gains and losses investment income increased 64 million in 2006 and 12 million in 2005 the increase in 2006 is primarily driven by interest income from higher cash and shortterm investment balances principally relating to the proceeds received from the ipo increases in interest rates and dividends received the interest earned on the ipo proceeds ultimately used for the stock redemption was approximately 7 million in the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates 

interest expense decreased 9 million in 2006 and remained unchanged in 2005 from 2004 during the year ended december 31 2006 4 million of the reduction in expense was due to a refund of interest assessed in an audit of the company’s federal income tax return as well as the reduction of interest reserve requirements related to the company’s tax reserves resulting from the reassessment of such reserves in addition 4 million was due to lower interest accretion relating to the us merchant lawsuit settlement 

other gains and losses decreased in 2006 primarily due to a 17 million settlement the company received in resolution of a dispute of a customer business agreement and 9 million in gains relating to the sale of two affiliated investments in 2005 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 includes the impact of the 395 charitable contribution of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation this contribution was recorded as an expense in the income statement however it is not deductible for tax purposes this resulted in a significant impact on our effective tax rate as follows 

 

  the effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 829 345 and 265 respectively the rate in 2006 was higher than 2005 primarily due to the nondeductible charitable contribution of mastercard class a common stock to the foundation during the second quarter of 2006 mastercard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of class a common stock we donated to the foundation under the terms of the contribution to the foundation this contribution is generally not deductible by mastercard for tax purposes this transaction is discussed in more detail in the section under the heading “impact of the ipo” accordingly as a result of the significant difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donation the calculation of an effective tax rate for the 2006 period is not meaningful the increase in the effective tax rate for 2005 as compared to 2004 was attributable to the settlement and reassessment during 2004 of various tax audit issues discussed below 

  

the components impacting the effective tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory tax rate of 35 are as follows 

 

 liquidity 

we need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit at december 31 2006 and 2005 we had 25 billion and 13 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities with which to manage operations we expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital needs for the next twelve months however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see item 1a—“risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report see also note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 650 million compared to 273 million in 2005 and 344 million in 2004 in 2006 the increase in cash from operations was due to stronger operating performance higher accounts payable and customer and merchant incentive accruals partially offset by higher payments for litigation and customer and merchant incentive prepayments in 2005 the decrease 

  

in cash provided by operating activities was due to a 40 million voluntary contribution to our qualified pension plan as well as higher income tax payments and prepayments made in accordance with new customer incentive agreements these cash outflows in 2005 were offset by stronger operating performance versus 2004 and an increase in accruals for personnel costs associated with the company’s employee incentive and severance plans 

the use of cash from investing activities for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to net purchases of availableforsalesecurities and our investment on the internal development of capitalized software to support our business additionally in 2005 we acquired certain businesses and invested in the internal development of capitalized software and purchases of fixed assets to support our business the net cash provided by financing activities increased in 2006 as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of class a common stock to investors in the ipo including the proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of approximately 25 billion which was offset by 18 billion for the redemption of class b common stock and a 12 million dividend payment 

under the terms of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement we are required to pay 100 million annually each december through the year 2012 in addition for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we made payments of 96 million and 15 million for currency conversion litigation and other litigation settlements 

on april 28 2006 we entered into a committed 3year unsecured 25 billion revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with certain financial institutions the credit facility which expires on april 28 2009 replaced our prior 225 billion credit facility which was to expire on june 16 2006 borrowings under the credit facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers and subject to a limit of 500 million for general corporate purposes the facility fee and borrowing cost are contingent upon our credit rating at our current rating we pay a facility fee of 8 basis points on the total commitment or 2 million annually interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be charged at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin of 37 basis points the libor margin or an alternative base rate a utilization fee of 10 basis points would be charged if outstanding borrowings under the facility exceed 50 of commitments we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility as of december 31 2006 there were no borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2006 or the previous facility at december 31 2005 the majority of the credit facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of mastercard international 

following the announcement of our planned ownership and governance changes standard  poor’s placed our credit ratings on credit watch with negative implications and announced the intention to lower our longterm counterparty credit rating from a to bbb and our subordinated debt rating from bbb to bbb both with stable outlook upon completion of the ipo on may 25 2006 these rating changes took effect the change in our longterm counterparty rating resulted in an increase in the facility fee on the credit facility from 7 to 8 basis points or 250 thousand annually additionally the libor margin increased from 28 to 37 basis points we do not expect these rating changes to materially impact our liquidity or access to capital 

mastercard europe and european payment system services sprl a subsidiary of mastercard have a 1 million euro overdraft facility there is also a 1 million euro guarantee facility for mastercard europe interest on borrowings under the overdraft facility is charged at 50 basis points over the relevant market index and interest for the guarantee facility is paid at a rate of 15 per annum on outstanding guarantees there were no borrowings under these facilities at december 31 2006 and 2005 however the euro guarantee facility supported bankissued guarantees for a total of 849 thousand euros and 810 thousand euros for the respective periods which reduced the amount of funds available under this facility deutsche bank ag is the lender of these facilities and is a customer and member of mastercard international 

mastercard europe has one additional uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros the interest rate under this facility is euro libor plus 50 basis points per annum for amounts below 100 million 

  

euros and euro libor plus 250 basis points for amounts over the 100 million euro limit for drawings in currencies other than the euro interest will be charged at the above margins over the relevant currency base rate there were no material borrowings under this agreement at december 31 2006 and 2005 hsbc bank plc is the lender of this facility and is a customer and member of mastercard international 

in september and december 2006 mastercard’s board of directors declared quarterly dividends each at 009 per share of class a common stock and class b common stock the september dividend was paid on november 10 2006 and was for an aggregate amount of 12 million the december dividend was paid on february 9 2007 and was for an aggregate amount of 12 million on february 6 2007 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share payable on may 10 2007 to holders of record on april 9 2007of our class a common stock and class b common stock the aggregate amount payable for this dividend is estimated to be approximately 21 million the declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition settlement guarantees operating results available cash and current and anticipated cash needs 

future obligations 

the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2006 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances 

 

        

  related parties 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2006 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 11 billion or 34 of total net revenue the loss of any of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and net income see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report 

seasonality 

portions of our business are seasonal our gross revenue is favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period however customer and merchant incentives which are recorded as contrarevenue and advertising holiday promotions and incentives also increase generally causing our profitability to decline in the fourth quarter 

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

  

   

   

   

   

 recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement 109” “fin 48” fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize measure present and disclose in its financial statements the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities fin 48 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2006 we expect the adoption of fin 48 will increase other liabilities by approximately 5 million to 10 million and decrease retained earnings by the same amount 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies which have been approved by 

  

the board of directors governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2006 as compared to december 31 2005 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a nonfunctional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 forward currency contracts against the us dollar were both purchased with notional amounts of 35 million and 78 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 17 million and 33 million respectively based on the year end 2006 and 2005 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at 2 million and 4 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased with notional amounts of 121 million and 218 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 45 million and 39 million respectively based on the year end 2006 and 2005 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at 7 million and 16 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

at december 31 2006 forward currency contracts against the brazilian real were purchased with notional amounts of 11 million based on the year end 2006 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the brazilian real is estimated to create a loss valued at 1 million 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of nineteen other stable transaction currencies the remaining 145 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as availableforsale investments with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure based on the net present value of expected future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in interest rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of 22 million and 19 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively our heldtomaturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements 

our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities a 100 basis point decrease in rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in a fair value loss of 2 million and 5 million for december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 in this report 

  

at december 31 2006 and 2005 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement there were 3 million euros and 5 million euros outstanding at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively under these credit facilities see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 in this report 

equity price risk 

we own trading securities which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of 1 million and 2 million in the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively to the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense

 item 1 business 

overview 

mastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit debit and related payment programs of nearly 25000 financial institutions we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic ™  maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to these financial institutions as part of managing these brands we also provide our financial institution customers with a sophisticated set of information and transaction processing services and establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing these transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by assessing our customers based on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments 

a typical transaction processed over our system involves four parties in addition to ourselves the cardholder the merchant the issuer the cardholder’s bank and the acquirer the merchant’s bank our customers are the financial institutions that act as issuers and acquirers using our transaction processing services issuers and acquirers facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout the world providing merchants with an efficient and secure means of receiving payment and consumers and businesses with a convenient payment method accepted worldwide we guarantee the settlement of many of these transactions among our customer financial institutions to ensure the integrity of our payment system in addition we undertake a variety of marketing activities designed to maintain and enhance the value of our brands however cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

mastercard incorporated was incorporated as a delaware stock corporation in may 2001 we conduct our business principally through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international a delaware membership corporation that was formed in november 1966 our financial institution customers are generally principal or affiliate members of mastercard international the common stock of mastercard incorporated is owned by principal members of mastercard international 

  

our business has a global reach and has experienced significant growth gross dollar volume on cards carrying the mastercard brand as reported by our customers gdv was 17 trillion in 2005 a 132 increase in us dollar terms over the gdv reported in 2004 in 2005 we processed 140 billion transactions including 26 billion pinbased online debit transactions a 135 increase over the transactions processed in 2004 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business our strategy is to drive growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as corporate payments prepaid cards and chip based cards enhancing our merchant relationships maintaining unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we intend to expand our role in targeted geographies by among other things pursuing incremental payment processing opportunities in the european union in connection with the implementation of the single european payment area initiative and in latin america and asiapacific countries we are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to leverage our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the longterm we believe that we can increase our volume of business with key customers over time and in support of this strategy we are hiring additional resources and developing sales and other personnel 

we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment accordingly we have faced heightened regulatory scrutiny particularly with respect to interchange fees and legal challenges in recent years interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among acquirers and issuers have been the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation as they have increased in recent years and as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies although we establish interchange fees and collect and remit them on behalf of those of our customers entitled to receive them we do not generally earn revenues in connection with interchange fees however if issuers cannot collect or are forced to reduce interchange fees this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system such as ours lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge in addition we are exposed to a variety of significant lawsuits in addition to those relating to interchange fees including federal antitrust claims claims under state unfair competition statutes and claims relating to our currency conversion practices see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

many of the legal and regulatory challenges we face are in part directed at our current ownership and governance structure in which our customers—our member financial institutions—own all of our common stock and are involved in our governance by having representatives serve on our global and regional boards of directors while we strongly dispute these challenges we believe that a more open ownership and governance structure following the transactions described below under “proposed new ownership and governance structure” should leave us less prone to challenges and provide us with additional defenses to the challenges we may face by ensuring that our members own a minority of the equity rights in our company and have no voting rights except over a limited range of matters that are not competitively sensitive transitioning to a board of directors that includes a significant majority of directors who are independent of us and of our members and limiting the continued participation of our members in governance at a regional level to advisory bodies only or in the case of europe to a regional board that is overseen by our independent board of directors 

proposed new ownership and governance structure 

mastercard is pursuing a plan for a new ownership and governance structure that will include the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors the establishment of a charitable foundation and the transition to being a publicly traded company 

  

under the proposed ownership and governance structure our current stockholders are expected to retain an equity interest in mastercard incorporated through ownership of a new nonvoting class b common stock in addition existing stockholders are expected to receive a new class m common stock that will have no economic rights but will provide them with certain rights including the right to approve specified significant corporate actions such as mergers the sale of substantially all of our assets or the abandonment of our current business and entitle them to elect up to three of our directors but not more than one quarter of all directors and are otherwise nonvoting we also intend to issue shares of a new voting class a common stock to public investors through an initial public offering or ipo additional shares of new class a common stock are expected to be issued as a donation to the mastercard foundation a charitable foundation incorporated in canada 

at a special meeting of stockholders held on november 28 2005 our stockholders approved the initial public offering the amendment and restatement of our and of mastercard international’s certificate of incorporation and the amendment and restatement of mastercard international’s bylaws in addition our stockholders approved the mastercard incorporated 2006 long term incentive plan which is an omnibus plan that provides for a variety of types of stockbased awards see part i item 4 of this report 

accordingly prior to the ipo we intend to reclassify all of our 100000348 outstanding shares of class a redeemable common stock so that each of our existing stockholders will receive 135 shares of our class b common stock for each share of class a redeemable common stock that they held prior to the reclassification and a single share of our class m common stock in addition at the time of the ipo we intend to issue 13500047 shares of our class a common stock as a donation to the mastercard foundation an independent charitable foundation located in canada we intend to use all but 650 million of our net proceeds from the ipo including any proceeds received pursuant to the option of the underwriters to purchase additional shares in the ipo to redeem a number of shares of class b common stock from our existing stockholders that is equal to the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock that we issue to investors in the ipo including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares and to the mastercard foundation in the event that the underwriters do not exercise in full their option to purchase up to an additional 4615132 shares of class a common stock from us in connection with the ipo our certificate of incorporation will require us subject to applicable law and to the board of directors’ fiduciary duties prior to the time of our 2007 annual meeting of stockholders to issue additional shares of class a common stock in a public offering and to use the proceeds from such offering to redeem additional shares of class b common stock so that immediately following such subsequent offering and redemption our existing stockholders will own approximately 41 of the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock and class b common stock at that time 

the change in ownership and governance the ipo the donation to the mastercard foundation and the reclassification and redemption of a portion of the shares held by our existing stockholders are collectively referred to as the “ownership and governance transactions” in this report following the ownership and governance transactions investors in the ipo are expected to own 61535098 shares of class a common stock representing 46 of our equity and 82 of our general voting power or 66150230 shares representing 49 of our equity and 83 of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full the mastercard foundation is expected to own 13500047 shares of class a common stock representing 10 of our equity and 18 of our general voting power or 17 of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full and our existing stockholders are expected to own 59965325 shares of class b common stock representing 44 of our equity or 55350193 shares representing 41 of our equity if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full and shares of class m common stock that entitle them to elect up to three of our directors and approve specified significant corporate actions but are otherwise nonvoting 

  

our industry 

we operate in the global payments industry which consists of all forms of payment including 

 

  

  

 the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards have different attributes depending on the type of accounts to which they are linked 

 

  

  

 the primary general purpose card brands include mastercard visa american express jcb diners club and discover historically these brands—including mastercard—were principally associated with “pay later” credit or charge cards in the united states and other major international markets today mastercard and visa cards may be issued in any of the “pay later” “pay now” or “pay before” categories 

“pay now” cards may be further categorized into several subsegments 

 

  

  

 mastercard and visabranded cards comprise the primary offline debit cards in addition to maestro the primary online debit card brands are electron and interlink owned by visa and various regional or countryspecific online debit networks brands such as star pulse owned by discover nyce and others in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia in addition to cirrus the primary cash access card brands are plus owned by visa and the online debit network brands referenced above local domestic online debit brands are the primary brands in many countries in these markets issuers have historically relied on the maestro and cirrus brands and visa’s plus and interlink brands to enable crossborder transactions which typically constitute a small portion of overall volume 

in addition to general purpose cards private label cards comprise a significant portion of all card based forms of payment typically private label cards are issued by a merchant such as a department store or gasoline retailer and can be used only at the issuing merchant’s locations

we provide transaction processing and other paymentrelated services to our customers in connection with these services we also deploy dedicated customer relationship management teams to our key customers to bring them customized solutions built upon our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting 

processed transactions and gdv 

we generate revenues from the fees we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services these fees are typically transactionbased and include fees for authorization and settlement we also earn revenues by charging our customers assessments based on the gross dollar volume gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands accordingly our revenues are impacted by the number of transactions that we process and the use of cards carrying our brands the tables below provide some information regarding these key drivers of our revenues

    transaction processing 

introduction  we operate a system that links issuers and acquirers around the globe for transaction processing services and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards at millions of merchants worldwide a typical transaction processed over our system involves four participants in addition to ourselves issuers the cardholders’ banks acquirers the merchants’ banks merchants and cardholders consequently the payment system we operate is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system the following diagram depicts a typical pointofsale card transaction 

in a typical transaction a cardholder a purchases goods or services from a merchant b using a card after the transaction is authorized by the issuer d using our network the acquirer c pays the amount of the 

  

purchase net of a discount to the merchant this discount which we refer to as the merchant discount takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee described below the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus any interchange fee and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account our rules generally guarantee the payment of mastercard transactions and certain cirrus and maestro transactions between issuers and acquirers 

for participants in a fourparty payment system the economics of a card transaction vary widely depending on such factors as whether the transaction is domestic and if it is domestic the country in which it takes place or crossborder whether it is a pointofsale purchase transaction or cashwithdrawal and whether the transaction is processed over a network such as mastercard’s or is handled solely by a financial institution that is both the acquirer for the merchant and the issuer to the cardholder an “onus” transaction 

a significant portion of the merchant discount is generally paid from the acquirer to the issuer in the form of an interchange fee the balance of the merchant discount is retained by the acquirer to cover its costs and profit margin acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction including for example fees for extending revolving credit as described below we charge issuers and acquirers operational fees and assessments for the services we provide them 

interchange fees represent a sharing of a portion of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours generally interchange fees are collected from acquirers and passed to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services which benefit all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants in some circumstances such as cash withdrawal transactions this situation is reversed and interchange fees are paid by issuers we establish default interchange fees “mifs” in certain circumstances that apply when there are no other interchange fee arrangements in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection and remittance of mifs through the settlement process however we generally do not earn revenues from them as noted above mifs are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards and are subject to regulatory or legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of mifs and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

mastercard revenue sources  mastercard generates revenues by charging transaction processing and related fees and gdv and cardbased assessments to both issuers and acquirers on an aggregate basis we earned approximately 66 of our revenues in connection with operations fees and approximately 34 of our revenues in connection with assessments in 2005 and approximately 63 of our revenues in connection with operations fees and approximately 37 of our revenues in connection with assessments in 2004 operations fees are typically transactionbased and include core authorization clearing and settlement fees currency conversion fees switch fees connectivity fees fees for warning bulletins and related compliance programs other operations fees such as hologram and acceptance development fees and userpay fees for a variety of services rebates and incentives are recorded as contrarevenues in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—revenues” in part ii item 7 of this report 

on a global basis we generate a majority of our revenue from issuers the allocation of our revenues between operations fees and assessments and among issuers and acquirers varies materially across our regions issuers typically pay operations fees and assessments acquirers principally pay assessments on gdv or cards and to a lesser extent certain operations fees 

generally we process all mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the us and in a few markets outside of the united states we process substantially all crossborder mastercard maestro and cirrus transactions we charge relatively higher rates for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions and earn 

  

currency conversion fees if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies offline debit transactions are generally signaturebased debit transactions and are processed and priced similar to credit transactions operating fees for processing online debit transactions maestro and cirrus transactions are priced in a similar manner as offline debit and credit transactions 

assessments are calculated based on our customers’ gdv assessment rates vary by region most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles these rates also vary by the type of transaction we generally assess at higher rates for crossborder volumes compared to domestic volumes we also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals credit and offline debit transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions in addition from time to time we may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs these assessments are often introduced at the request of customers in a particular region or country 

we generate a significant amount of revenue from currency conversion on a global scale we have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies these revenues are the result of crossborder transactions by cardholders that require currency conversion to settle the transactions between issuers and acquirers mastercard generally uses a wholesale rate increased by a certain percentage or a governmentmandated rate to convert transactions in foreign currencies into us dollars revenues from processing currency conversion transactions fluctuate with crossborder travel 

authorization clearing and settlement  we facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of the transactions described above and similar transactions through our proprietary worldwide computer and telecommunications network 

authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is approved by the issuer or in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions mastercard’s network provides for the transmission of authorization requests and results among issuers acquirers and other transaction processors or networks our rules which may vary across regions establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 

clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central processing systems 

once transactions have been authorized and cleared mastercard provides services in connection with the settlement of the transactions—that is the exchange of funds along with associated fees settlement is provided through our settlement account management system once clearing is completed a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position the actual exchange of funds takes place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer and approved by mastercard and a settlement bank chosen by mastercard customer settlement occurs in us dollars or in a limited number of other selected currencies in accordance with mastercard’s established rules 

credit and offline debit processing  our transaction processing services are managed principally through our global technology and operations center in o’fallon missouri a stateoftheart worldwide network control facility with over 52000 square feet of white computer room environment our core processing systems are large and highly scalable we have the capacity to handle over 38 billion instructions per second but operate at only 70 capacity at a peak day and we can substantially scale this capacity upon demand mastercard processes transactions in 160 currencies from 210 countries 

mastercardbranded transactions credit and offline debit transactions are generally cleared through our centralized processing system known as the global clearing management system gcms and the related 

  

information is typically routed among customers via our data transport network which we refer to as banknet both gcms and banknet have benefited from significant recent investments as a result of our five year 160 million system enhancement strategy as part of this strategy we migrated banknet to a virtual private network in 1997 a first for our industry since that time our virtual private network has significantly reduced transaction processing times and enhanced data security for our customers in our systems transactions flow between nearly 1000 endpoints distributed throughout the world rather than through a central location this approach enhances the reliability of mastercard transactions by providing several levels of redundancy 

gcms has helped us to improve our timetomarket in introducing new programs and services more importantly using gcms we can partner with our customers to provide valueadded services to merchants and cardholders for example issuers can use gcms to develop promotions for segments of their card portfolios without investing in their own systems development we believe that gcms and our other recent systems enhancements position us well to pursue incremental processing opportunities 

our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year in the event that our main processing facility in o’fallon missouri becomes disabled we have a coprocessing facility in kansas city missouri our transaction processing systems have redundant power supplies and backup processes to ensure continued operation in the event of a fault we have consistently maintained core systems availability for our global processing systems at a rate in excess of 99 

online debit processing  we also operate the mastercard debit switch “mds” which principally supports the processing of online debit transactions the mds switches financial messages provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs clearing and settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks unlike the authorization and clearing processes described above which involve the exchange of transaction data in two discrete messages one for authorization and again for clearing the mds generally operates as a “single message” system in which clearing occurs simultaneously with the initial authorization request 

in addition to continued investment in the mds mastercard is enhancing its position in online debit processing through a series of initiatives since 2004 mastercard has worked with issuers and acquirers to increase the routing priority of mastercard’s systems for the processing of pin pos transactions and has begun to establish direct processing connections to major us merchants in addition mastercard has entered into an agreement with efunds corporation a provider of electronic payments software and processing solutions to provide endtoend debit processing services for midsized to large issuers as part of this agreement mastercard provides network services and efunds provides card issuer processing atm risk management and other support services to our customers 

regional transaction processing  we provide transaction processing authorization clearing and settlement services for customers in the europe region through our subsidiary mastercard europe these services allow european customers to facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout europe recently we have substantially completed a multiyear technical convergence project to fully integrate our european authorization clearing and settlement systems with our global clearing and settlement systems in australia we also operate a separate regional processing facility for the asiapacific region this facility processes a majority of the mastercardbranded transaction volumes for australia and new zealand 

outside of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most intracountry as opposed to crossborder transaction activity conducted with mastercard maestro and cirrus cards is authorized cleared andor settled by our customers or other processors without the involvement of our central processing systems we do not earn transaction processing fees for such activity accordingly we derive a significant portion of our nonus revenues from processing crossborder transactions as part of our strategy we are developing and promoting domestic processing solutions for our customers that are designed to leverage our significant 

  

investments in our global and regional processing systems for example during 2003 mastercard europe began authorizing and clearing transactions for the members of s2 limited formerly known as switch card services limited which operate an electronic domestic debit card network in the united kingdom under the switch ® brand as part of an agreement to migrate switch branding to maestro by 2007 in brazil we acquired the local debit brand redeshop ® in 2002 the switch migration and redeshop acquisition have resulted in significant increases in our local processing debit volume in the united kingdom and brazil respectively 

customer relationship management 

we are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to leverage our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting services for these customers we have implemented an internal process to identify our key customers on a global and regional basis based on what we consider to be appropriate business opportunities and to organize our relationships with them to ensure that their priorities are consistently identified and incorporated into mastercard’s project brand processing technology and related strategies to achieve this we undertake an integrated customer planning process with key customers on an annual basis 

we also seek to enter into business agreements with key customers through which we offer financial incentives and other financial support to issue and promote our cards these incentives often consist of a reduction in our volumebased fees and assessments for certain customers based on the achievement of gdv targets or other performance metrics we believe that our business agreements with key customers have contributed to our strong volume and revenue growth in recent years 

the pricing terms and duration of the agreements with our customers vary significantly most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and may be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors —business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” and “—our revenue would decline significantly if we lose one or more of our most significant customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business” in part i item 1a of this report in addition to our key customer agreements we have standard licensing arrangements with all of our customers that permit them to use our trademarks and subject them to the rules governing our payment programs those customers with whom we do not have customized agreements are generally subject to standardized pricing arrangements

offline debit card programs  we offer mastercardbranded offline debit card programs in the united states and other countries through our agreement with efunds corporation we market efunds’ processing services as an integrated component of our debit programs the agreement is intended to add a flexible endtoend debit transaction processing solution to the services and products already available to our customers 

as a result of the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit mastercard has taken a number of actions to modify its mastercardbranded offline debit card programs in the united states among other things mastercard has adopted rules that allow merchants to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa however us merchants who choose to accept mastercardbranded debit cards must accept all mastercardbranded debit cards see “risk factors—business risks—we have repealed our competitive programs policy as a result of a final judgment in our litigation with the us department of justice and our business may suffer as a result” in part i item 1a of this report 

  

maestro  maestro is mastercard’s global online debit program based on information from our customers we estimate that at december 31 2005 the maestro brand mark appeared on approximately 601 million cards worldwide including 42 million mastercardbranded cards representing 5 growth from december 31 2004 based on the same information we also believe that maestro was accepted for purchases at more than 9 million merchant locations globally we believe that our maestro brand has a leading position among online debit brands in many markets throughout the world particularly in europe we believe that the strong presence of maestro in europe will position us well when the single european payments area initiative which will create a more integrated payment market in europe is implemented we believe that the global acceptance of maestro contributes to the growth of our debit business and adds value to the services that we provide to our customers maestro cards are issued and maestro transactions are processed pursuant to a set of rules and procedures that are separate from the rules applicable to mastercard credit and offline debit transactions 

cirrus  we make the cirrus brand available to customers to provide global cash access for our customers’ proprietary atm cards we believe the cirrus brand provides cash access at more than 15 million participating atms and other cash dispensing locations around the globe making it one of the world’s largest cash access brands generally cardholders with cards bearing the mastercard maestro or cirrus logo may use a network atm to access funds on deposit in their accounts if a debit card is used or to obtain a cash advance if a credit card is used typically atm cards contain multiple cash access logos and the cirrus brand enables a transaction which will then be processed by the mds only if there is no regional or domestic cash access brand that is capable of doing it

we also seek to increase mastercard brand awareness and preference and to encourage card usage and loyalty by sponsoring a variety of sporting and entertainment properties that support the “priceless” campaign and mastercard brand positioning in soccer mastercard is the exclusive payment system sponsor of the fifa world cup we also sponsor other leading soccer events including the union of european football associations “uefa” european championship and the uefa champions league in europe in golf we are a sponsor and the preferred card of the pga tour the champions tour the pga of america the lpga the european pga tour and other events in baseball we are the exclusive payments brand sponsor of major league baseball and have also established separate marketing and sponsorship arrangements with over half of the major league baseball teams during the 2005 season in football we have established sponsorship arrangements with the majority of the national football league teams mastercard is the exclusive payments brand sponsor for the national hockey league finally as part of our marketing strategy in family entertainment we have a longterm sponsorship arrangement with certain business units of nbc universal that entitles mastercard to marketing and promotional programs with certain of universal’s motion picture theme park music and home video properties 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

we estimate that at december 31 2005 cards carrying the mastercard brand were accepted at over 23 million merchant locations around the world as of the same date we believe that mastercardbranded cards were also accepted at over 15 million atms and manual cash access locations information on atm and manual cash access locations is reported by our customers and is partly based on publiclyavailable reports of payment industry associations government agencies and independent analysts in australia canada and the united states 

merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard on the one hand large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory threats to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” and “risk factors—business risks—merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability” in part i item 1a of this report in addition we may be required to increase the amount and scope of incentives that we provide to merchants to encourage the acceptance and usage of our cards which may adversely affect our business on the other hand we believe there are many opportunities to enhance our relationships with merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards for example in 2004 we made available directly to merchants those portions of our rules that apply to card acceptance and related activities thereby increasing the level of transparency and predictability of our payment system for merchants we have also begun to hold meetings with merchant advisory groups that have been established in key global markets including the united states canada and australia 

we aim to maintain the unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded programs by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the categories of merchants that accept cards carrying our brands we are presently focused on expanding acceptance in electronic commerce environments in fast throughput businesses such as fast food restaurants and in public sector payments such as those involving taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories second we seek to increase the number of payment channels where mastercard 

  

programs are accepted such as by introducing mastercard acceptance in connection with recurring payment applications third we seek to increase usage of our programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a wide range of promotional programs on a global basis we also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants receive incentives or discounts to consumers for the use of mastercardbranded programs or otherwise indicate a preference for mastercardbranded programs when accepting payments from consumers 

we also support technical initiatives designed to make mastercard card acceptance more attractive for specific merchants such as our quick payment service for fast food restaurants and other merchants where rapid transactions are required in addition mastercard paypass ™  a “contactless” payment solution that enables consumers simply to tap or wave their payment card on a specially equipped terminal is designed to help our customers further grow their businesses by capturing a portion of transactions that were previously cashbased and increasing card activity on underutilized card accounts and reduces transaction time which appeals to merchants in fast throughput businesses in 2004 mcdonald’s agreed to accept paypass at thousands of its locations in the united states paypass pilot programs have been expanded to include customers and merchants in the asiapacific region and canada as of december 31 2005 more than 46 million paypass cards were issued in the united states largely in atlanta denver and new york 

we also view recurring payments as a significant opportunity to expand mastercard card acceptance and usage and we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make recurring bill payments in a variety of categories—including telephone cable utilities and insurance—on their mastercardbranded cards 

in addition we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their marketing partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner is typically a charity educational or similar organization 

membership standards 

we establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding membership in mastercard international and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

rulemaking and enforcement 

membership in mastercard international and its affiliates is generally open only to banks and other regulated and supervised financial institutions applicants for membership must meet specified membership eligibility requirements which may vary between regions 

in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to perform all obligations required of members licenses convey intellectual property rights to members including access to the network and usage of our brands risk management reviews and antimoney laundering due diligence reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission as well as on existing members all applicants and members must meet the requirements of mastercard’s antimoney laundering program as a condition of our licenses members agree to comply with our bylaws policies rules and operating regulations “standards” mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce the standards which relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement member failures and allocation of losses in europe certain of these standards will be established and enforced by our european board after the consummation of the global ownership and governance transactions 

  

to help ensure that members conform to the standards we run a number of compliance programs including reviewing card programs proposed by members and requiring members to undergo an annual audit by an independent certified public accountant or similar examination by a regulatory authority to tailor mastercard’s programs and services to the needs of local markets we have approved a number of variations to the standards applicable to specific regions 

customer risk management 

as a guarantor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2200 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 3100 affiliate debit licensees our estimated gross legal settlement risk exposure for mastercardbranded transactions which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 156 billion as of december 31 2005 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements herein principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members approximately 22700 

to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor principal members’ and affiliate debit licensees’ financial health economic and political operating environments and compliance with our rules and standards if the financial condition of a member or the state of a national economy in which it operates indicates that it may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us or other mastercard members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of letters of credit and bank guarantees as of december 31 2005 we have required our members to post 15 billion in collateral held for legal settlement exposure for mastercardbranded transactions if a member becomes unable or unwilling to meet its obligations to us or other members we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral if provided in order to minimize any potential loss to our members or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership however mastercard has never terminated a member due to the member’s risk profile 

for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure we have established a 225 billion committed credit facility which is subject to renewal see “risk factors—risks related to our business—business risks—as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our members default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations” in part i item 1a of this report subject to approval by the board of directors members may be charged for the amount of settlement losses incurred during the ordinary activities of the company following the ownership and governance transactions we will no longer have the right to impose special assessments arising out of extraordinary events on members see “risk factors—risks related to our business—business risks—upon completion of the ownership and governance transactions we will no longer have the right to impose special assessments upon the members of mastercard international which could leave us exposed to significant losses that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent” in part i item 1a of this report 

payment system integrity 

the integrity of our payment system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal uses of our system fraud is most often committed in connection with lost stolen or counterfeit cards or stolen account information resulting from security breaches of systems that store cardholder account data see “risk factors—risks related to our business—business risks—account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue” in part i item 1a of this report fraud is also more likely to occur 

  

in transactions where the card is not present such as electronic commerce mail order and telephone order transactions security and cardholder authentication for these remote channels are particularly critical issues facing our customers and merchants who engage in these forms of commerce where a signed cardholder sales receipt is generally unavailable 

we monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our rules and standards to combat fraudulent activity we also operate several compliance programs to ensure that the integrity of our payment system is maintained key compliance programs include excessive chargeback merchant audit and account data compromise programs our members are also required under our rules to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner 

our customers are responsible for fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or the merchants from whom they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid them in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands we provide education programs and various risk management tools to help detect fraud including mastercard securecode ™  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer using a unique personal code and site data protection a program that assists customers and merchants in protecting commercial sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises generally we charge our customers fees for these antifraud programs and services 

enterprise risk management 

mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see part i item 1a—risk factors of this report the degree to which mastercard manages risk is vital to its financial condition and profitability managing risk is the responsibility of our business units and is an integral component of our business activities a dedicated enterprise risk management erm group provides risk management analysis support coordination and oversight across mastercard through erm we are identifying assessing mitigating and monitoring key business risks in a consistent manner 

some of our key erm activities have included developing an erm framework policy and risk governance structure identifying and categorizing key internal and external risks creating risk reporting determining mitigating activities and action plans and providing a riskweighted decisionmaking methodology for the strategic planning process 

intellectual property 

we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard ®  maestro ® and cirrus ®  through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our business operations 

competition 

mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments and other electronic forms of payment including cardbased payment systems as a result of a global trend in which electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment we have gained market share versus cash and checks in recent years however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide transaction volume 

  

within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa including plus electron and interlink american express and jcb among others in specific countries we face significant competition from other competitors such as discovernovus in the united states within the global general purpose card industry visa has significantly greater volume than we do in certain countries other competitors also have leading positions such as jcb in japan our deposit access programs also encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from atm and pointofsale debit networks in various countries such as star nyce and pulse in the united states interac in canada and eftpos in australia we also compete against businesses that issue their own payment cards such as retail stores and petroleum companies new competitors may also enter our marketplace from time to time for example china union pay has been established as the predominant domestic card acceptance brand in the people’s republic of china and is seeking to expand its acceptance and cash access network internationally 

our competitors include operators of proprietary endtoend payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders such as american express and discover these competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy among other things these competitors do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers because they have direct relationships with both merchants and cardholders interchange fees which are a characteristic of fourparty payments systems such as ours are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business” in part i item 1a of this report because they do not utilize formal interchange fees operators of endtoend payment networks to date have generally avoided the same regulatory scrutiny and litigation challenges we face and accordingly may enjoy a competitive advantage over fourparty payments systems 

in addition ongoing litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry for example under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit us merchants now have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states in addition as a result of the court’s decision in our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our competitive programs policy some of our customers may now do business with american express or discover in the united states which could adversely affect our business a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge finance have announced that they have begun to issue or will issue american express or discoverbranded cards see “risk factors—business risks—we have repealed our competitive programs policy as a result of a final judgment in our litigation with the us department of justice and our business may suffer as a result” in part i item 1a of this report finally we are being sued in several state and federal courts because of our currency conversion practices the outcome of these lawsuits potentially could require us to change our currency conversion practices which may have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot predict the final outcome of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings for a description of these and other matters see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

we compete intensely with other bankcard associations principally visa for the loyalty of our customers in most countries throughout the world including the united states financial institutions typically issue both mastercard and visabranded payment cards as a result of this structure known as “duality” we compete with visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs in some countries particularly canada card issuers are “nondual” meaning that they issue either mastercard or visa payment cards but not both issuance of mastercard and visa debit cards is generally nondual in the united states as well due to visa’s historical debit exclusivity rule as a result of the litigation with the us department of justice visa’s debit exclusivity rule is no longer enforceable however visa enacted a bylaw that imposes a fee on its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states if they reduce their visa debit volume by more than 10 which if enforced may prevent us from acquiring business from current visa customers in nondual countries we compete with visa for a customer’s entire business 

  

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of incentives we provide to our customers including possible pricing discounts over the past several years we have experienced continued pricing reductions we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards however our customers can terminate their business agreements with us in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat for mastercard because our business strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in a loss of business for mastercard see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report 

in addition we face competition with respect to particular segments of the payment card industry in the united states for example mastercardbranded transactions account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low market penetration in the united states in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by atmdebit pointofsale networks as opposed to us 

we also face competition from transaction processors such as first data corporation and total systems some of which are seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services certain of these transaction processors have significantly greater scale than we do which may provide them with a cost advantage if these processors grow their transaction volumes more quickly than we do their scale advantages over us may accelerate and they could capture some of our core processing business similarly some of our competitors provide currency conversion services at the pointofsale through dynamic currency conversion dynamic currency conversion occurs when a transaction is converted at the individual merchant location in real time from the currency of the merchant into the cardholder’s billing currency thereby bypassing mastercard’s currency conversion processes when mastercard performs currency conversion centrally the transaction is submitted to mastercard in the currency of the merchant and is converted by mastercard into the cardholder’s billing currency the growth of dynamic currency conversion services could reduce our currency conversion volumes which could adversely affect our revenues 

we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems such as paypal and payments across mobile devices among other things these competitors provide internet currencies that can be used to buy and sell goods online “virtual checking” programs that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for online payments and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do in mobile commerce we also face competition from established network operators whereas the mastercard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment account as established by their card issuer network operators may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the customer’s monthly bill 

  

we believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive position in the global payments industry are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 government regulation 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in recent years the regulatory environment in which we operate has become increasingly stringent in particular interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 

furthermore mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is impacted by such regulations certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the federal financial institutions examination council to ensure our compliance with applicable data security requirements for example in recent years the federal banking regulators have adopted a series of regulatory measures intended to require more conservative accounting greater risk management and higher capital requirements for bank credit card activities particularly in the case of banks that focus on subprime cardholders in addition mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium pursuant to standards published by the european central bank that are principally targeted at managing financial legal and operations risk 

in addition aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to the federal trade commission’s and the banking regulators’ information safeguards rules under the grammleachbliley act the rules require each financial institution including us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue in the united states there are a number of bills pending in congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address these issues congress will likely consider data securitydata breach legislation in 2006 which if implemented could affect us and our customers in addition a number of us states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation in europe the european parliament and council passed the european directive 9546ec on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member 

  

states to which we and our customers are subject the directive establishes general principles with regard to the processing of personal data including the legal grounds for processing the rights of individuals with regard to their personal data restrictions on transfers of the personal data outside the european economic area and the obligation of the controller of that information to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data 

mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are also subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act which has required mastercard to create and implement a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and has imposed similar requirements on some of our customers our antimoney laundering program must at a minimum include the designation of a compliance officer provide for the training of employees regarding antimoney laundering responsibilities provide internal policies procedures and controls to mitigate money laundering risks and be independently audited 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by the us treasury office of foreign assets control ofac while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in syria iran sudan north korea cuba or libya a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries which have each been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states and are subject to ofac restrictions our reputation may suffer due to our association with these countries which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

in addition in 2005 and 2004 regulations implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act were issued that among other things make permanent the preemptive effect of several provisions of the fair credit reporting act that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses additional implementing regulations are anticipated later this year one such regulation pertaining to “riskbased pricing” could have a significant impact on the application process for credit cards resulting in increased costs of issuance andor a decrease in the flexibility of card issuers to set the price of credit there is also increasing scrutiny among regulators and congress with respect to our customers’ pricing of credit and their underwriting standards any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to price credit freely could result in reduced amounts of credit available to consumers and therefore potentially reduce our transaction volume and revenues 

the us congress is also presently considering regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet gambling internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us or our customers most us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our customers’ underwriting standards the implementation of recently enacted bankruptcy reform legislation in the united states may also directly affect our customers’ business models for their payment cards business the us congress has also examined the practices of credit card issuers in general which could lead to significant legislative restrictions these new requirements and developments may affect our customers ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer our existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth 

  

in addition to the review of interchange fees regulators in the united states and elsewhere are considering a variety of proposals to address such matters as privacy data use and disclosure rules that if implemented could adversely impact our business and our prospects or the businesses of our customers for a discussion of certain risks associated with these and other regulatory initiatives see “risk factors legal and regulatory risks—the payments industry is generally the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may impose costly new compliance burdens and costs on us and our customers and lead to decreased transaction volumes through our systems” and “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards and could increase our costs” in part i item 1a of this report 

outside of the united states a number of jurisdictions have implemented legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payments systems for example regulators in mexico colombia singapore and malaysia have been given statutory authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in those countries in the case of singapore and malaysia one of the main policies behind the regulations is to protect the stability of the financial systems of those countries in malaysia there is presently no further requirement other than registration and the supply of information in singapore mastercard does not fall into the ambit of active regulation at present but we may be required to supply information to the regulators in the future 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 4300 persons of which approximately 1400 were employed outside of the united states we consider our relationship with employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

legal and regulatory risks 

interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business 

interchange fees which represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours are generally the largest component of the costs that acquirers charge merchants in connection with the acceptance of payment cards typically interchange fees are paid by the merchant bank the acquirer to the cardholder bank the issuer in connection with transactions initiated with our payment system’s cards interchange fees including mastercard’s default interchange fees mifs are subject to increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide as they have increased in recent years and as cardbased forms of payment have become relatively more important to local economies regulators are seeking to reduce these costs through regulatory action for example 

 

  

   

  

 interchange fees are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions including colombia mexico new zealand poland portugal norway sweden brazil hungary and spain we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a coordinated approach to interchange matters and as a result developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange in other jurisdictions in the united states interchange fees have also been the topic of increased congressional and regulatory interest in particular the us house of representatives has passed a bill that would commission a study by the federal trade commission of the role of interchange in alleged price gouging at gas stations in february 2006 the energy and commerce committee of the us house of representatives held a hearing on interchange fees also the general topic of interchange fees has been raised in hearings and other forums including conferences held by various federal reserve banks individual state legislatures in the united states are also reviewing interchange fees for instance legislators in washington state and kentucky have proposed bills that would limit or cap interchange fees finally the merchants payment coalition a coalition of trade associations representing businesses that accept credit and debit cards is mounting a challenge to interchange fees in the united states by seeking legislative and regulatory intervention 

in addition merchants are seeking to reduce interchange fees through litigation in the united states merchants have filed over forty classaction suits alleging that our interchange fees violate federal antitrust laws these suits allege among other things that mastercard’s purported setting of interchange fees constitutes horizontal pricefixing between and among mastercard visa and their member banks in violation of section 1 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade the suits seek treble damages in an unspecified amount attorney’s fees and injunctive relief see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of mifs and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face 

if issuers cannot collect or are forced to reduce interchange fees they may be unable to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also charge higher fees to consumers thereby making our card programs less desirable and reducing our transaction volumes and profitability or attempt to decrease the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge if we are less successful than visa in defending interchange fees we could also be competitively disadvantaged against visa if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fees such regulation may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business 

if we are found liable in any of the cases brought by american express or discover we may be forced to pay substantial damages 

in 1998 the us department of justice filed suit against mastercard international visa usa inc and visa international corp in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that certain 

  

aspects of the governance of mastercard and visa were unlawful and that mastercard’s competitive programs policy cpp and a similar visa bylaw provision that prohibited financial institutions participating in the respective systems from issuing competing proprietary payment cards such as american express or discover acted to restrain competition although we were successful in defending the relevant aspects of our governance structure at trial the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that our cpp and visa’s bylaw constituted unlawful restraints of trade under the us federal antitrust laws based on the final judgment in this matter our cpp became unenforceable in october 2004 and was subsequently repealed thereafter discover and american express each filed suit against us visa usa inc and visa international services association alleging that the cpp and visa’s bylaw provision caused each injury by unlawfully restraining trade under the us federal antitrust laws discover also alleges that it suffered injury by reason of our rules which required merchants in the united states to accept our debit cards if they accepted other mastercardbranded cards before these rules were modified as part of the us merchant lawsuit described below the american express complaint names a number of member banks as codefendants in connection with their respective claims american express and discover each requested that the district court give collateral estoppel effect to its findings in its judgment in the department of justice litigation although the district court has denied that request at this stage in the litigation the court indicated that american express and discover may refile a motion for collateral estoppel after further proceedings if the court were to give effect to collateral estoppel on one or more issues in the future then significant elements of plaintiffs’ claims would be established thereby making it more likely that we would be found liable and making the possibility of an award of damages that much more likely in the event all issues are subsequently decided against mastercard in dispositive motions during the course of the litigation then there is the possibility that the sole issue remaining will be whether a damage award is appropriate and if so what the amount of damages should be 

neither american express nor discover has specified the amount of damages sought and due to the considerable uncertainty associated with these proceedings it is currently not reasonably possible to estimate the amount or range of any potential liability each of american express and discover has conveyed their belief that these damages are substantial moreover because these actions have been brought under the us federal antitrust laws any actual damages will be trebled and we may be subject to joint and several liability among the defendants if liability is established which could significantly magnify the adverse effect upon us of any adverse judgment if we are unsuccessful in defending against either or both of these lawsuits the ultimate liability for mastercard could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in the quarterly and annual period when such losses are recognized could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent similarly if we decide to settle either or both lawsuits or if we establish provisions in connection with them which will depend on our continuing reconsideration of the progress of the litigation such a settlement or the establishment of such provisions could also have such a material adverse effect see “risk factors—legal and regulatory risks—if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected” and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

if we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we generate significant revenue from processing crossborder currency transactions for members however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful in particular a trial judge in california found that our currency conversion practice is deceptive under california state law and ordered us to mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to california cardholders the final judgment and restitution process have been stayed pending mastercard’s appeal in addition we have been served with similar complaints in several state courts seeking to in effect extend the judge’s decision to our cardholders outside of california we have succeeded in having several of these cases dismissed or transferred to 

  

the us district court for the southern district of new york and combined with putative federal class actions the class actions allege that our currency conversion practices violate federal antitrust laws see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein if we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards in another country or may be required to modify our currency conversion practices 

based upon litigation developments certain of which were favorable to mastercard and progress in ongoing settlement discussions in these currency conversion cases and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” mastercard recorded an additional 75 million of legal reserves in 2005 as a result of this additional reserve we have now established total legal reserves of 89 million in connection with these currency conversion cases based on future developments this estimate may be revised the amount of damages sought has not been specified in any of these cases 

if we are found liable in any of the other litigations that have been brought against us or in any other litigation to which we may be subject in the future we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

there are currently actions against mastercard international in a number of state courts and the district of columbia in a number of these state courts there are multiple complaints against mastercard international brought under state unfair competition statutes on behalf of putative classes of consumers the claims in these actions mirror the allegations made in the us merchant lawsuit which was brought on behalf of a class of us merchants against mastercard international and visa and alleged among other things that our “honor all cards” rule and a similar visa rule which required merchants who accept mastercard cards to accept for payment every validly presented mastercard card constituted an illegal tying arrangement in violation of section 1 of the sherman act the plaintiffs also asserted that we and visa conspired to monopolize what they characterized as the pointofsale debit card market in june 2003 mastercard international entered into a settlement agreement that resolved the us merchant lawsuit and contract disputes with certain customers the settlement agreement required among other things that we pay 125 million in 2003 and 100 million annually each december from 2004 through 2012 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein for a description of the settlement agreement the putative consumer class actions are not covered by the terms of the june 2003 settlement agreement these actions assert that merchants faced with excessive merchant discount fees have passed these overcharges to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold in addition to these litigations we are also being sued in several other state and federal courts under both federal antitrust laws and state common and statutory law in connection with certain of our rules including those related to chargeback transactions chargebacks refer to the situation where a transaction is returned or charged back to an acquirer by an issuer at the request of the cardholder or for some other reason the claims directed at our chargeback rules allege that mastercard’s chargeback policies and related rules violate section 1 and section 2 of the sherman act which prohibits contracts combinations or conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade and monopolization or attempted monopolization respectively the claims allege that such rules constitute unlawful agreements andor monopolization in restraint of trade in addition the complaints contain claims under state common law including breach of contract tortious interference with contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing none of the putative consumer class actions specifies the amount of damages sought and except for one lawsuit in which the plaintiff seeks 60 million in compensatory damages as well as 180 million in punitive damages none of the lawsuits relating to chargeback transactions specifies the amount of damages sought see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein we may also be sued in the future in the united states or in other jurisdictions by our customers merchants or consumers for substantial damages or injunctive relief in connection with our business practices if we are unsuccessful in our defense against the consumer class actions the merchant chargeback litigations or any other litigation we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices and pricing structure any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

  

if we determine in the future that we are required to establish reserves or we incur liabilities for any litigation that has been or may be brought against us our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

except with respect to currency conversion litigations we have not established reserves for any of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved and we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of charges if any that may be required to provide reserves for these matters in the future we may determine in the future that a charge for all or a portion of any of our legal proceedings is required including charges related to legal fees in addition we may be required to record an additional charge if we incur liabilities in excess of reserves that we have previously recorded such charges particularly in the event we may be found liable in a large classaction lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable could be significant and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent a plaintiff in one of our antitrust litigations has asserted in a written communication that the damages it believes it is likely to recover in its lawsuit will exceed our capital and ability to pay and that the damages in such lawsuit and in our other pending litigations are likely to be in the billions of dollars before trebling see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

limitations on our business and other penalties resulting from litigation or litigation settlements may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

as a result of antitrust litigation that was brought against us by the us department of justice until october 15 2006 we are required to permit issuers with which we have entered into business agreements in the united states before october 15 2004 to terminate those agreements without penalty in order to enter into agreements with american express or discover in addition as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein these limitations and any future limitations on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlements could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the payments industry is generally the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may impose costly new compliance burdens on us and our customers and lead to decreased transaction volumes through our systems 

we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular our customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and abroad and consequently mastercard is at times affected by such regulations regulation of the payments industry including regulation applicable to us and our customers has increased significantly in recent years for example in 2002 mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act which has required our customers and us to create and implement comprehensive antimoney laundering programs increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products that we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards 

we are also subject to regulations imposed by the us treasury office of foreign assets control ofac while mastercard has no business operations subsidiaries or affiliated entities in syria iran sudan north korea cuba or libya a limited number of financial institutions are licensed by mastercard to issue cards or acquire merchant transactions in certain of these countries which have each been identified by the us state department as terroristsponsoring states and are subject to ofac restrictions our reputation may suffer due to our association with these countries which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the valuation of our 

  

stock further certain us states have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as terroristsponsoring states and similar legislation may be pending in other states as a result pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments 

in addition in 2005 and 2004 a number of regulations were issued implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act which among other things makes permanent the preemptive effect of several key provisions of the fair credit reporting act that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses additional implementing regulations are anticipated later this year one such regulation pertaining to “riskbased pricing” could have a significant impact on the application process for credit cards resulting in increased costs of issuance andor a decrease in the flexibility of card issuers to set the price of credit regulators and the us congress have also increased their scrutiny of our customers’ pricing of credit and their underwriting standards any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our customers’ ability to price credit freely could result in reduced amounts of credit available to consumers which could materially and adversely affect our transaction volume and revenues 

the us congress is also presently considering regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet gambling internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and interchange fees among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on us andor our customers most us states are considering a variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiatives could require us or our customers to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various categories of payment card transactions thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our customers’ underwriting standards the implementation of recently enacted bankruptcy reform legislation in the united states may also directly affect our customers’ business models for their payment cards business the us congress has also examined the practices of credit card issuers in general which could lead to significant legislative restrictions these new requirements and developments may affect our customers’ ability to extend credit through the use of payment cards which could decrease our transaction volumes in some circumstances new regulations could have the effect of limiting our customers’ ability to offer new types of payment programs or restricting their ability to offer existing programs such as stored value cards which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth 

increased regulatory focus on us such as in connection with the matters discussed above may increase our costs which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues materially and adversely impact our financial performance 

existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment cards issued and could increase our costs 

we and our customers are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data use and security in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we and our customers could be negatively impacted by these regulations for example in the united states we and our customers are respectively subject to the federal trade commission’s and the banking regulators’ information safeguard rules under the grammleachbliley act the rules require that each financial institution including us develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue in 2005 there has been a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach in the united states there are a number of bills pending in congress and there have been several congressional hearings to address these 

  

issues congress will likely consider data securitydata breach legislation in 2006 which if implemented could affect us and our customers in addition a number of states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach and several other states are considering similar legislation 

in europe the european parliament and council have passed the european directive 9546ec on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data which obligates the controller of an individual’s personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data the directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in european union member states to which we and our customers are subject 

regulation of privacy and data use and security in these and other jurisdictions may increase the costs of our customers to issue payment cards which may decrease the number of our cards that they issue any additional regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations which could materially and adversely affect our profitability finally failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines sanctions or other penalties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business 

business risks 

we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in order to increase transaction volumes we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives pricing discounts and other support to issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts over the past several years we experienced continued pricing reductions the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives moderates our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not succeed in these efforts 

our strategy is to grow our business by among other things focusing on our key customers and entering into customized business agreements with key customers around the globe we may in the future not be able to enter into such agreements on terms that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitors are larger or have greater financial resources than we do in addition to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit furthermore a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenue are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat to us because our strategy contemplates 

  

entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor resulting in the loss of business for mastercard for example in 2006 bank of america acquired mbna corporation an issuer with a larger proportion of its card portfolio devoted to mastercard than bank of america in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

the continued consolidation in the banking industry also produces a smaller number of large customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard in addition consolidations could prompt our customers to renegotiate our business agreements to obtain more favorable terms this pressure on the prices we charge our customers could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

in addition changing regulatory environments in certain regions may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues 

our revenue would decline significantly if we lose one or more of our most significant customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

most of our customer relationships are not exclusive and in certain circumstances may be terminated by our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services until october 15 2006 we are required to permit issuers with which we have entered into business agreements in the united states before october 15 2004 to terminate those agreements without penalty in order to enter into agreements with american express or discover as a result of the antitrust litigation that was brought against us by the us department of justice see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

in addition a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2005 the net fees from these customers represented an aggregate of approximately 975 million or 33 of total revenue one of our large customers jpmorgan chase bank and its affiliates generated 11 of our consolidated revenue in 2005 jpmorgan chase bank also acts as our us settlement bank and has a significant commitment under our revolving credit facility loss of business from jpmorgan chase bank or any of our other large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

merchants are increasingly focused on the costs of accepting cardbased forms of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

we rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the acceptance of our cards we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard for instance as a result of the settlement agreement in connection with the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject our debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein in addition some large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory threats to interchange fees that mastercard is now defending since interchange fees represent a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “—interchange fees are subject to increasingly intense legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may have a material adverse impact on our revenue our prospects for future growth and our overall business” the increasing focus of merchants on the costs of accepting cashbased forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings large merchants are also able to 

  

negotiate pricing discounts and other incentives from us and our customers in order to accept our payment cards as merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive our payment programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house payments and other electronic forms of payment including cardbased payment systems see “business—competition” in part i item 1 of this report some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have we may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these threats in addition our competitors may be more efficient in introducing innovative programs and services than we are as a result our revenue or profitability may decline 

we have repealed our competitive programs policy as a result of a final judgment in our litigation with the us department of justice and our business may suffer as a result 

based on a final judgment of our litigation with the us department of justice in october 2004 our cpp which prohibited financial institutions participating in our system from issuing competing proprietary payment cards became unenforceable and was subsequently repealed see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein as a result our issuers are now permitted to issue general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network such as american express or discover this may cause our members to issue fewer cards with our brand and to enter into arrangements with our competitors to issue cards thereby reducing the volume of transactions that we process decreasing our revenues a number of our large customers including bank of america citibank hsbc usaa and ge finance have begun to issue or have announced that they will issue american express or discoverbranded cards accordingly the repeal of the cpp may have a material adverse affect on our business revenue and profitability 

we depend significantly on our relationships with our customers to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationships or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders or determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each issuer determines these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not solicit merchants to process transactions or establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which are responsibilities of our acquirers as a result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuer and acquirer customers in turn our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

with the exception of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transactions conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus cards are authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without involving our central processing systems because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands together with the perception of our payment system among 

  

regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business in addition our competitors may process a greater percentage of domestic transactions in jurisdictions outside the united states than we do as a result our inability to control the endtoend processing on cards carrying our brands in many markets may put us at a competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to introduce valueadded programs and services that are dependent upon us processing the underlying transactions 

we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

if we are unable to grow our debit business particularly in the united states we may fail to maintain and increase our revenue growth 

in recent years we believe that industrywide offline and online debit transactions have grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions however in the united states we believe that transactions involving our brands account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low market penetration in the united states we may not be able to increase our market penetration for debit transactions in the united states since many of our competitors have longstanding and strong market positions we may also be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by other atmdebit pointofsale networks in addition we generally earn higher revenues on pointofsale purchase transactions than on cash access transactions and on domestic credit and offline debit transactions than on comparable online debit transactions 

furthermore in june 2003 following the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit visa enacted a bylaw requiring its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states to pay a socalled “settlement service fee” if these issuers reduce their debit visa volume by more than 10 this bylaw was later modified to clarify that the settlement service fee would only be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of debit cards to mastercard see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements herein for a description of our response to this bylaw provision if visa is permitted to impose this settlement service fee on issuers of debit cards according to this bylaw it would penalize visa members seeking to do debit business with mastercard and would effectively prohibit them from converting their debit card programs to our programs 

any of these factors may inhibit the growth of our debit business which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and overall prospects for future growth 

the changes to our governance structure in connection with the ownership and governance transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business relationship with our members 

a number of our key customers are currently represented on our board of directors upon the consummation of the ownership and governance transactions the organization and composition of our board of directors will be substantially restructured in particular our certificate of incorporation will be amended to provide that with the exception of the directors to be elected by the holders of our class m common stock any person who is or has been during the prior three years a director officer employee agent or representative of or otherwise has any business relationship that is material to such person with a member or former member of mastercard international or of an operator member or licensee of any competing general purpose payment card system or any affiliate of such person may not serve as a director of mastercard in addition our members will be able to own only class b common stock which has no voting power and class m common stock which is generally 

  

nonvoting except that it provides the right to elect up to three directors but not more than onequarter of all directors and approve specified significant corporate actions if certain of our members are dissatisfied with these changes to our corporate governance structure this could have a material adverse effect on our business relationship with them and they may elect to instead do business with a competitor with a different governance structure in addition our members’ ownership in our company will be reduced substantially in connection with the initial public offering and related transactions the reduced ownership may reduce their interest in the continued success of our business a significant loss of revenue or transaction volumes from our members could have a material adverse effect on our business 

global economic political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending and in crossborder travel which may materially and adversely impact our revenue and profitability 

the global payments industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands in addition a significant portion of the volume generated on cards carrying our brands and a significant portion of the revenue we earn outside the united states are associated with crossborder business and leisure travel which may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other conditions including the threat of terrorism and outbreak of diseases such as sars and avian flu in particular revenue from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuates with cross border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency 

as a guarantor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity if any of our members default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations 

we may incur liability in connection with transaction settlements if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems liquidity shortfall insolvency or other reasons if a principal member or affiliate debit licensee is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other members we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not contractually obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole if an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations in order to maintain the integrity and acceptance of our brands our estimated gross legal settlement exposure which is calculated using the average daily card charges made during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of days to settle was approximately 156 billion as of december 31 2005 we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of 225 billion to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our members while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure by any of our largest customers on their peak day concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our largest customers or of several of our smaller customers may exceed our available resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover a settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such a payment and may therefore be exposed to significant losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition for more information on our settlement exposure as of december 31 2005 see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

following the ownership and governance transactions we will no longer have the right to impose special assessments upon the members of mastercard international which could leave us exposed to significant losses that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

in connection with the ownership and governance transactions the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of mastercard international will be amended to eliminate the right of mastercard international to impose special assessments upon its members this special assessment right currently allows mastercard international to 

  

recover from its members all or a portion of its expenses and liabilities arising out of extraordinary events such as settlements or judgments in major litigations and catastrophic occurrences that may cause significant risk or damage to mastercard therefore following the ownership and governance transactions we will bear the expenses and liabilities associated with extraordinary events without recourse to our members through a right of assessment accordingly the loss of this special assessment right leaves us exposed to significant risks and losses from these types of extraordinary events which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition or in certain circumstances even cause us to become insolvent 

standard and poor’s rating services has announced that they will downgrade our credit rating upon completion of our initial public offering which will result in an increase of our interest expense for borrowings under our credit facility further downgradings of our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

due to the loss of mastercard international’s right to impose special assessments upon its members in connection with this offering standard  poor’s rating services expects to lower our counterparty credit ratings from aa2 with negative outlook to bbba2 with stable outlook and our subordinated debt rating from bbb with negative outlook to bbb with stable outlook until the completion of the ownership and governance transactions our existing ratings will remain on credit watch with negative outlook the expected downgrading will result in an increase of our interest expense if borrowings were necessary under our credit facility in addition further downgrading of our credit ratings by standard  poor’s rating services or by any other rating agency could materially and adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced 

our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access fraud terrorism or accident most of our transaction processing systems are controlled by a single facility supported by a separate smaller coprocessing facility a natural disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers such as att for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability 

account data breaches involving card data stored by us or third parties could adversely affect our reputation and revenue 

we our customers and other third parties store cardholder account information in connection with our payment cards in addition our customers may sponsor thirdparty processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving our cards damage the reputation of our brands and lead to claims against us for example in 2005 a thirdparty processor that held account information for merchants and acquirers was subject to a security breach in connection with card and account information for approximately 40 million cards approximately 101 million of which were mastercard cards as a result we have been named in a lawsuit claiming unspecified damages and may be subject to additional lawsuits in connection with data security breaches involving payment cards carrying our brands if we are unsuccessful in defending lawsuits involving such data security breaches we may be forced to pay damages which could materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition any damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards which could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes revenue and future growth prospects or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us 

  

an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brands and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft as outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards if fraud levels involving our cards were to rise it could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance and reputational and financial damage to our brands which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of our cards could decline which would reduce our revenue and income 

the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards or by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our international operations 

during 2005 and 2004 approximately 45 and 42 of our revenue respectively was generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

competing dynamic currency conversion services could reduce the volume of foreign currency transactions we process or force us to change our pricing or practices which may materially and adversely affect our business 

some of our members and competitors provide currency conversion services at the point of sale known as dynamic currency conversion dynamic currency conversion services could if significant numbers of cardholders choose to use them replace our own currency conversion processing services or could force us to change our pricing or practices for these services if we process fewer transactions or are forced to change our pricing or practices for our currency conversion processing because of competing dynamic currency conversion services or otherwise our revenue may be materially and adversely affected 

  

our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly gdv are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers’ performance material changes in our customers’ performance compared to estimates could require us to restate our financial statements for prior periods which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stock price 

our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly gdv are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers’ performance such estimates are subsequently validated against actual performance as reported by our customers and differences are ordinarily adjusted in the period in which the customer reports actual results rebates and incentives which are recorded as contrarevenue are also estimated based on customer performance material changes in our customers’ performance compared to estimates or revisions to performance information subsequently reported by our customers in accordance with the mastercard rules could require us to restate our financial statements for prior periods any such restatements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and on the price of our class a common stock 

any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 

we may evaluate or make strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses products or technologies if so we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any such businesses products or technologies furthermore the integration of any acquisition may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations we may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserves and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders while we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses products and technologies and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations we have no present understandings commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 

we expect to record a significant net loss for the second quarter and full year of 2006 as a result of the donation of shares of our class a common stock and cash to the mastercard foundation and we may make additional cash donations to the mastercard foundation to allow it to meet its annual charitable disbursement requirements during the first four years of its operations 

at the time of the ownership and governance transactions we intend to donate 13500047 newlyissued shares of the new class a common stock representing approximately 10 of our equity to the mastercard foundation a private charitable foundation incorporated in canada we also expect to donate an estimated 40 million in cash to the foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable giving for the first four years of its operations and we may make additional cash contributions to the foundation during and after this period because the foundation’s operations are currently being established the overall size and timing of our expected initial cash donation have not been finally determined 

in connection with the donation of the shares of the class a common stock we expect to record an expense that is equal to the value of the shares we are donating the value of the shares of class a common stock we donate will be determined based on the initial public offering price per share of class a common stock in the initial public offering less a marketability discount this marketability discount and the methodology used to quantify it will be determined by management in consultation with independent valuation consultants retained by mastercard as a result of this expected expense we anticipate recording a significant net loss in the quarter the stock is donated and may record a net loss for the 2006 fiscal year we also expect to record an expense equal to the value of any cash we donate in the period or periods in which such donation or donations are made the expense of these donations will not be deductible to mastercard for tax purposes as a result of this difference between financial statement and tax treatments of the donations we expect there to be a significant increase to our effective tax rate in the periods in which the contributions are made 

  

changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect our benefit plans 

we provide certain retirement benefits to our us employees through the mastercard accumulation plan map a qualified cash balance benefit plan in 2003 a us federal district court ruled that international business machines corporation’s cash balance pension plan violated the age discrimination provisions of erisa if this decision is upheld on appeal and applied to cash balance plans generally we may be required to amend the map and like other us companies with cash balance plans may be exposed to claims from plan participants these developments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” and mastercard europe sprl “mastercard europe” together “mastercard” or the “company” included elsewhere in this report 

overview 

we are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers’ credit debit and related payment programs we manage a family of wellknown widely accepted payment card brands including mastercard ®  mastercard electronic ™  maestro ® and cirrus ®  which we license to our financial institution customers as part of managing these brands we also provide our customers with information and transaction processing services and establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system by customers and merchants we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing these transaction processing and other paymentrelated services operations fees and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gross dollar volume gdv of activity on the cards that carry our brands assessments our pricing for transactions and services is complex each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided in addition standard pricing varies among our regional businesses and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements operations fees are typically transactionbased and include authorization settlement and switch connectivity currency conversion warning bulletins and other fees for a variety of additional services assessments are based on gdv for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the nature of the transactions that generate gdv gdv includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage purchases cash disbursements balance transfers and convenience checks on mastercardbranded cards our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers our operating expenses are comprised primarily of general and administrative expenses such as personnel professional fees data processing telecommunications travel and advertising and marketing expenses to promote our brands including promotions and sponsorships 

we evaluate and monitor our business based on our results from operations including our percentage of revenue growth and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue and our financial position in addition we utilize growth in gdv and processed transactions to monitor the strength of our business 

our liquidity and capital position are strong we had 13 billion in cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities and 12 billion in stockholders’ equity as of december 31 2005 

we achieved doubledigit revenue growth of 13 in 2005 the increase in revenues was due to higher gross usage on cards carrying our brands for goods and services a larger number of transactions processed by mastercard higher crossborder travel by cardholders using our cards and certain pricing changes that went into effect on april 1 2005 the pricing changes including implementing new fees increasing existing fees or 

  

modifying our fee calculation methodology accounted for approximately 5 of net revenue growth in 2005 significant changes in the methodology for calculating fees primarily related to a component of settlement fees being changed from tiered pricing to a flat rate a component of authorization fees being changed from monthly pricing to weekly pricing which increased utilization and connectivity fees being expanded to include a charge for the volume of information being transmitted in addition to the fixed fee initially charged operating expenses excluding the impact of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements increased 11 in 2005 we continued to reduce our operating expenses excluding the impact of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements as a percentage of total revenues to 84 in 2005 from 86 in 2004 

in june 2002 we acquired europay international sa now mastercard europe in 2004 we acquired a research firm and a consulting firm both of which were immaterial to our operations the results of operations for these acquisitions are included from their respective acquisition dates 

we successfully complied with sarbanesoxley section 404 testing three years ahead of the us securities and exchange commission’s deadline for nonaccelerated filers we concluded based on our assessment that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of december 31 2005 

we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paperbased forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business our strategy is to drive growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and highergrowth segments of the global payments industry such as corporate payments prepaid cards and chip based cards enhancing our merchant relationships maintaining unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands we intend to expand our role in targeted geographies by among other things pursuing incremental payment processing opportunities in the european union in connection with the implementation of the single european payment area initiative and in latin america and asiapacific countries we are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to leverage our expertise in payment programs brand marketing product development technology processing and consulting services for these customers by investing in strong customer relationships over the longterm we believe that we can increase our volume of business with key customers over time and in support of this strategy we are hiring additional resources and developing sales and other personnel 

there is increased regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees and other aspects of the payments industry which could have an adverse impact on our business in addition we face exposure to antitrust and other types of litigation competition and pricing pressure within the global payments industry is increasing due in part to consolidation within the banking sector and the growing power of merchants regulatory actions litigation and pricing pressure may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues see item 1a—risk factors of this report for these and other risks facing our business 

we are party to a number of currency conversion litigations as discussed in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements herein based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these cases and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” mastercard recorded an additional 75 million of legal reserves in 2005 as a result of these additional reserves we have now established total legal reserves of 89 million in connection with these currency conversion cases this estimate may be revised based on future developments in these cases 

proposed new ownership and governance structure 

we are pursuing a plan for new ownership and governance structure that will include the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors that will be independent of mastercard and our members the establishment of a charitable foundation and the transition to being a publicly traded company 

  

under the proposed ownership and governance structure mastercard’s current stockholders are expected to retain a 44 equity interest or 41 of our equity if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full in the company through ownership of new nonvoting class b common stock in addition existing stockholders are expected to receive a new class m common stock that will have no economic rights but will provide them with certain rights including the right to approve specified significant corporate actions and entitle them to elect up to three of mastercard’s directors but not more than one quarter of all directors but are otherwise nonvoting 

mastercard also intends to issue shares of a new voting class a common stock to public investors through an initial public offering upon successful completion of the offering these public investors will hold shares representing an expected 46 of the company’s equity and 82 of its general voting power or 49 of our equity and 83 of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full additional shares of class a common stock representing approximately 10 of the company’s equity and 18 of its voting rights or 17 of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full are expected to be issued as a donation to the mastercard foundation a charitable foundation incorporated in canada the “foundation” this donation will have a dilutive effect on each existing stockholders’ equity interest in the company the foundation will build on mastercard’s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education understand and utilize technology and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force in addition the foundation will work in conjunction with organizations that provide microfinance programs and services to financially disadvantaged persons and communities in order to enhance local economies and develop entrepreneurs we are in the process of identifying directors of the foundation that will be required to be independent of us and our members 

in connection with this donation we expect to record an expense that is equal to the aggregate value of the class a common stock we are donating at the time of the offering together with approximately 40 million in cash to be donated to the foundation over a period of up to four years in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations and we may make additional cash contributions to the foundation after this period because the foundation’s operations are currently being established the overall size and timing of our expected initial cash donation have not been finally determined the value of the shares of class a common stock we donate will be determined based on the initial public offering price per share of class a common stock in the initial public offering less a marketability discount this marketability discount and the methodology used to quantify it will be determined by management in consultation with independent valuation consultants to be retained by mastercard as a result of this expense we expect to record a significant net loss for the quarter in which the offering is completed and may record a net loss for the 2006 fiscal year we also expect to record expense equal to the value of any cash we donate in the period or periods in which such donation or donations are made these donations will generally not be deductible to mastercard for tax purposes accordingly as a result of the difference between financial statement and tax treatments of the donations we expect there to be a significant increase to our effective tax rate in the periods in which the contributions are made 

we intend to use all but 650 million of our net proceeds from the initial public offering including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to redeem a number of shares of class b common stock from our existing stockholders that is equal to the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock that we issue to investors in the initial public offering including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares and to the foundation as a result our existing stockholders will own 41 of the company’s equity we intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes however we have not determined the amounts of such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to these purposes implementation of the new ownership and governance structure is subject to various approvals including requisite regulatory filings our stockholders approved the new ownership and governance structure at a special meeting on november 28 2005 

  

in addition in connection with our new ownership and governance structure we intend to implement equity based compensation plans the implementation date of these plans has not been determined as the underlying transactions have not been completed we expect to convert our existing long term incentive cash award plans into an equity based compensation plan based on the proposal for this conversion we may recognize 11 million additional personnel expense in future periods based on vesting within the plans our compensation committee has also granted 2006 awards under the equity based long term incentive plan we also intend to grant a one time restricted stock unit award to nonexecutive management employees which will result in deferred stockbased compensation equal to the fair value of the restricted stock units on the grant date which will be amortized over the threeyear vesting period 

impact of foreign currency rates 

our operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates assessment fees are calculated based on local currency volume which is converted to us dollar volume using average exchange rates for the quarter as a result assessment revenues increased in each period due to the devaluation of the us dollar in 2005 and 2004 a 13 and 15 increase in gdv on a us dollar converted basis respectively exceeded local currency gdv growth of 12 and 11 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year 

we are especially impacted by the movements of the euro relative to the us dollar since the functional currency of mastercard europe our principal european operating subsidiary is the euro the devaluation of the us dollar against the euro and the impact of the translation of mastercard europe’s operating results into us dollar amounts are summarized as follows 

 

 revenues 

we earned approximately 66 63 and 64 of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 34 37 and 36 of our net revenues from net assessments in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operations fees are user fees for facilitating the processing of payment transactions and information management among our customers mastercard’s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us issuers the cardholders’ banks acquirers the merchants’ banks merchants and cardholders operations fees are charged to issuers acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services specific programs to promote mastercardbranded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses the significant components of operation fees are as follows 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 generally we process all mastercardbranded domestic transactions in the us and in a few international markets we process substantially all crossborder mastercard maestro and cirrus transactions we charge relatively higher operations fee rates for settlement authorization and switch fees on crossborder transactions and earn currency conversion fees if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies offline debit transactions are generally signaturebased debit transactions and are processed and priced similar to credit transactions operation fees for processing online debit transactions maestro and cirrus transactions are priced in a similar manner as offline debit and credit transactions 

assessments are calculated based on our customers’ gdv assessment rates vary by region most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles these rates also vary by the type of transaction we generally assess at higher rates for crossborder volumes compared to domestic volumes we also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals credit and offline transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions in addition from time to time the company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs these assessments are often introduced at the request of customers in a particular region or country assessments that are based on quarterly gdv are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance 

  

in 2005 and 2004 gross revenue grew 21 and 16 respectively a component of our revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2005 was the result of implementing new fees and changes to existing fees charged to our customers on april 1 2005 however this growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives accordingly we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide gdv and other performancebased support incentives rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 22 16 and 17 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively these pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry and the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers and merchants the rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period that performance occurs 

we establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer’s transactions on a global basis our customers may choose to engage third parties for transaction processing and are responsible to ensure that these third parties comply with our standards cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards extend credit to cardholders determine the interest rates if applicable or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands 

the united states remains our largest geographic market based on revenues however international revenues grew at a faster rate than us revenues in 2005 and 2004 in 2005 the international revenue growth was not specifically related to one region in which we do business however in 2004 the growth was primarily in the european region due to new assessment revenue streams and increased transactions accordingly revenue generated in the united states was approximately 55 58 and 63 of total revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively no individual country other than the united states generated more than 10 of total revenues in any period 

our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors in the past our revenues have been impacted by specific events such as the war in iraq the sars outbreak and the september 11 2001 terrorist attack consumer behavior can be impacted by a number of factors including confidence in the mastercard brand 

  

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

  

      

operations fees 

the significant components in operations fees are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

assessments 

assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers’ gdv the components of assessments are as follows 

 

 gdv growth was 12 and 11 in 2005 and 2004 respectively when measured in local currency terms and 13 and 15 respectively when measured on a us dollar converted basis in addition to the increase in gdv assessments grew due to the following factors 

 

  

  

 rebates and incentives provided to customers and merchants relating to assessments reduce revenue moderate assessments growth and are generally based on gdv as well as a fixed component for the issuance of new cards or the launch of new programs rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 39 29 and 31 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in the percentage of rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments was the result of new or revised pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants in 2005 and 2004 we expect our agreements with our customers and merchants to continue to moderate net revenue growth in 2006 and subsequent years 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses we reduced our operating expenses excluding the impact of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements as a percentage of total revenues to 84 in 2005 from 86 in 2004 and 93 in 2003 operating expenses increased 299 million or 13 in 2005 compared to a decrease of 587 million or 21 in 2004 excluding the charges to earnings related to the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements there would have been an increase in operating expenses of 246 million or 11 in 2005 and 154 million or 7 in 2004 operating expenses increased in 2004 by 31 million in connection with the acquisition of a research firm and a consulting firm 

  

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel professional fees data processing telecommunications and travel in 2005 2004 and 2003 these activities accounted for approximately 46 46 and 49 of total revenues respectively general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in personnel expenses the major components of general and administrative expenses were as follows 

 

  

       

  

  

  

  

 advertising and market development 

advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships which promote our brands and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands in 2005 2004 and 2003 these activities accounted for approximately 34 35 and 38 of total revenues respectively advertising and market development expenses increased 92 million or 10 in 2005 and 65 million or 8 in 2004 

  

our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets our approach to marketing activities combines advertising sponsorships promotions interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated package designed to increase mastercard brand awareness and preference and usage of mastercard cards we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brands and image through advertising and marketing efforts on a global scale 

merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 

in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded a pretax charge of 721 million 469 million aftertax consisting of i the monetary amount of the us merchant lawsuit settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant lawsuit settlement and iii costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit the 721 million pretax charge amount was an estimate which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors 

we are party to a number of currency conversion litigations which are more fully described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included herein based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these currency conversion cases and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we recorded a 14 million reserve in 2004 and an additional 75 million reserve in 2005 this estimate may need to be revised based on future developments 

total liabilities for the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements changed as follows in millions 

 

 depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 12 million in 2005 and increased 2 million in 2004 the decrease is primarily related to the maturity of certain capital leases and certain assets becoming fully depreciated our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions this technology is continuously updated and improved during 2004 we completed a five year upgrade of all of mastercard’s core systems to improve productivity and lower overall processing costs 

in addition in 2003 our coprocessing technology center was moved from lake success new york to kansas city missouri our lake success coprocessing facility would have required a significant investment to rehabilitate its aging infrastructure and improve security kansas city missouri was selected as the new location for the coprocessing facility due to its relative proximity to our other processing facility in st louis missouri the cost of the new facility and equipment was 36 million 

  

other income and expense 

other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income interest expense and other gains and losses investment income increased 12 million in 2005 and decreased 8 million in 2004 the increase in 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates the decrease in 2004 resulted from a decline in the market value of our trading securities portfolio interest expense was the same in 2005 and 2004 and increased 7 million in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to interest expense related to imputed interest on the us merchant lawsuit settlement in 2005 we recognized 17 million in other gains relating to a settlement of a dispute of a customer business agreement and 9 million in gains relating the sale of two affiliated investments 

income taxes 

the effective income tax expense benefit rate for years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 was 345 265 and 361 respectively the rate in 2005 was higher than 2004 primarily attributable to the settlement and reassessment during 2004 of various tax audit issues discussed below the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 as compared to 2003 is attributable to the reassessment during 2004 of tax issues under examination in the us internal revenue service “irs” audit for the years 1998 through 2000 and issues under examination in japan for the years 2000 through 2003 in the course of the irs audit affirmative refund claims were filed and the related tax benefits were recognized in addition mastercard favorably settled a foreign tax audit in india for the years 1996 through 2001 the 2003 tax benefit was primarily driven by the us merchant lawsuit settlement the amount of the litigation settlement and its impact on pretax income was such that the permanent differences for 2003 which are shown in the table below did not significantly affect the tax rate resulting in a tax benefit at the highest marginal tax rate the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 

 liquidity 

we need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had 13 billion and 11 billion respectively of cash cash equivalents and availableforsale securities with which to manage operations we expect that the cash generated from operations and our 

  

borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital needs in 2006 however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see item 1a—“risk factors—legal and regulatory risks” in part i item 1a of this report 

 

 for the year ended december 31 2005 our operations provided 273 million of cash compared to 344 million in 2004 in 2005 and 2004 we made 115 million and 149 million respectively in payments related to the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and 40 million and 15 million respectively of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan the decrease in cash from operations in 2005 from 2004 period was due to higher income tax payments and prepayments made in accordance with new customer incentive agreements maintaining our customer relationships pursuant to these incentive agreements has required mastercard to provide more as well as higher prepayments of rebates and incentives than in previous periods these cash outflows are offset by stronger operating performance and an increase in accruals for personnel costs associated with the company’s employee incentive and severance plans the increase in cash from operations in 2004 from 2003 was primarily due to stronger operating performance in 2004 compared to 2003

      related parties 

we have approximately 1493 existing stockholders who are also our customers see part iii item 13—“certain relationships and related transactions”—of this report for a description of certain agreements between us and our principal stockholders 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers in 2005 the net revenues from these customers were approximately 981 million or 33 of total net revenue in january 2006 one of these customers purchased another of our key customers not among our top five revenue contributors accordingly the amounts for 2005 for this customer include the revenues of the other customer acquired the loss of any of these members could adversely impact our revenues and net income see “risk factors—business risks—consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report in addition as part of our business strategy mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with customers these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances see “risk factors—business risks—we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in part i item 1a of this report 

seasonality 

portions of our business are seasonal our gross revenue is favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period however advertising holiday promotions and incentives also increase correspondingly generally causing our profitability to decline in the fourth quarter 

  

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

 

   

   

   

 recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fas 1092 “fsp 1092” “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” the “act” fsp 1092 provides enterprises more time beyond the financial reporting period during which the act took effect to evaluate the act’s impact on the enterprise’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” we are not presently intending to repatriate any foreign earnings as defined under the act therefore fsp 1092 is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas 123 revised 2004 “sfas 123r” “sharebased payment” sfas 123r provides guidance on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for sharebased payments the company intends to adopt sfas 123r in connection with the implementation of equity based compensation plans as part of the company’s new ownership and governance structure the implementation date of these plans has not been determined and the underlying transactions remain subject to approval by the company’s stockholders the adoption of sfas 123r is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections—a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” “sfas 154” sfas 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements for changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas 154 also requires that a change in depreciation amortization or depletion method for longlived nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the implementation of sfas 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies which have been approved by the board of directors governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2005 as compared to december 31 2004 

foreign exchange risk 

we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies principally the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 forward currency contracts against the us dollar were both purchased with notional amounts of 78 million and 41 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 33 million and 20 million respectively based on the yearend 2005 and 2004 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at 4 million and 2 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased with notional amounts of 218 million and 128 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 39 million and no open contracts respectively based on the yearend 2005 and 2004 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at 16 million and 11 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of nineteen other stable transaction currencies the remaining 146 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

interest rate risk 

our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as availableforsale investments they are rated aa or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and mediumterm instruments with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity 

  

and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure based on the net present value of expected future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in interest rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of 19 million and 17 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively our heldtomaturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements 

our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities a 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of 5 million and 9 million for december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement there were 4 million euros and no amounts outstanding at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively under these credit facilities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

equity price risk 

we own trading securities which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of 2 million and 3 million in the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively to the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense

  mastercard incorporated was incorporated as a delaware stock corporation in may 2001 we conduct our business principally through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” a delaware membership corporation that was formed in november 1966 through mastercard international our business is structured as an open bankcard association in which cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly we do not issue cards set cardholder fees or determine the interest rates if applicable or fees charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands our customers are the principal and affiliate members of mastercard international which we refer to collectively as our “customers” or “members” we refer to the customers that issue our cards as “issuers” and those that enroll merchants into programs to accept our cards as “acquirers” we use the term “card” to refer to the plastic cards carrying our brands or those of our competitors together with the underlying credit charge deposit or asset account we use the term “mastercard” to refer to the mastercard brand generally and to the business conducted by mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international and mastercard europe sprl “mastercard europe” the common stock of mastercard incorporated is owned by principal members of mastercard international 

  in 2004 our gdv as reported by our customers was 1455 trillion a 106 increase on a local currency basis over the gdv generated in 2003 on a regional basis 2004 gdv growth was 93 in the united states 128 in canada 142 in europe 333 in latin america 255 in south asia middle east africa “samea” and 18 in asia pacific gdv has increased 932 on a local currency basis since 1999 gdv represents gross usage purchase and cash transactions on mastercardbranded cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks these figures exclude maestro and cirrus transactions at december 31 2004 the total number of mastercard cards in circulation worldwide as reported by our customers was 6795 million an 86 increase from december 31 2003 

  in recent years our corporate strategy has been to focus on our key customers to drive our business growth to strengthen our brands technology and acceptance network and to differentiate mastercard from our competition by developing innovative payment solutions and customized consulting services we remain committed to this strategic direction and have begun to implement initiatives to expand our customerfocused approach to a broader group of customers as well as to further develop relationships with merchants that accept our cards we will also seek to leverage our expertise in payment programs consulting services brand marketing technology and processing to expand the valueadded services we provide our customers we believe that debit and prepaid programs as well as corporate payment solutions offer particularly attractive opportunities for further growth 

1   we believe there are significant opportunities for continued strong growth in our core business particularly in international markets these opportunities take two forms first we continue to benefit from a worldwide trend in which payments are migrating from paperbased forms such as cash and checks to electronic forms such as payment cards this trend has helped to drive our volume and revenue growth for a number of years and we expect it to continue in 2005 second we believe there is an opportunity to increase mastercard’s share of our customers’ overall spending on their payments businesses by such means as pursuing additional transaction processing opportunities and by continuing to enter into business agreements with key customers these business agreements allow us to support the individual needs of our customers with tailored pricing and other business arrangements in exchange for significant volume and other commitments to mastercard in particular we believe that there are significant opportunities to pursue transaction processing arrangements and additional business agreements outside the united states 

  we operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving regulatory environment particularly with respect to interchange fees interchange fees represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours generally interchange fees are paid by acquirers to issuers in connection with transactions initiated with our cards these fees are collected from acquirers and passed to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services which are of benefit to all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants we establish multilateral interchange fees “mifs” in certain circumstances as default fees that apply when there are no other interchange fee arrangements in place between an issuer and an acquirer we administer the collection of mifs through the settlement process however we generally do not earn revenues from them mifs are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards and are subject to regulatory or legal challenges in a number of jurisdictions we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of mifs and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face as described more fully below in “risk factors” 

  as a global business we have structured our organization to be sensitive to the requirements of the regions and countries in which we operate our global board of directors has delegated authority over a variety of matters including certain rulemaking enforcement and feesetting decisions to regional boards of directors covering each of asia pacific canada europe latin america and the caribbean samea and the united states 

2 payment services 

   we operate a network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe for transaction processing services and through them permits mastercard cardholders to use their cards at millions of merchants worldwide a typical transaction processed over our network involves four participants in addition to ourselves issuers acquirers merchants and cardholders consequently the payment system we operate is often referred to as a “fourparty” payment system in a typical transaction a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card after the transaction is authorized by the issuer using our network the acquirer pays the amount of the purchase net of a discount to the merchant this discount which we refer to as the merchant discount takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction minus any interchange fee and posts the transaction to the cardholder’s account we provide transaction processing services to facilitate the authorization clearing and settlement of these transactions and similar transactions through our proprietary worldwide computer and telecommunications network a significant portion of our revenues — approximately 35 in 2004 — are earned in connection with our provision of these authorization clearing and settlement services our transaction processing services are provided principally through our global technology and operations headquarters in o’fallon missouri 

  authorization clearing and settlement authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is approved by the issuer or in certain circumstances by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions mastercard’s network provides for the transmission of authorization requests and results among issuers acquirers and other transaction processors or networks our rules which may vary across regions establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions we processed over 92 billion mastercardbranded authorizations on our global processing systems in 2004 

  clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between the issuer and the acquirer after a transaction has been completed mastercard transactions are generally cleared through our centralized processing system known as the global clearing management system gcms and the related information is typically routed among customers via our data transport network which we refer to as banknet 

  once transactions have been authorized and cleared mastercard provides services in connection with the settlement of the transaction — that is the exchange of funds along with associated fees settlement is provided through our settlement account management sam system once clearing is completed a daily 

3 reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position the actual exchange of funds takes place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer and approved by mastercard and a settlement bank chosen by mastercard customer settlement occurs in us dollars or in other selected currencies in accordance with established rules 

  we also operate the mastercard debit switch “mds” which principally supports the processing of cirrus and maestro debit transactions the mds switches financial messages provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs clearing and settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks unlike the authorization and clearing processes described above which involve the exchange of transaction data in two discrete messages one for authorization and again for clearing the mds generally operates as a “single message” system in which clearing occurs simultaneously with the initial authorization request 

  our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day every day of the year in the event that our main processing facility in o’fallon missouri becomes disabled we have a coprocessing facility in kansas city missouri our transaction processing systems have redundant power supplies and backup processes to ensure continued operation in the event of a fault we consistently maintain core systems availability for our global processing systems at a rate in excess of 999 

  we also generate a significant amount of revenue from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers on a global scale we have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies these revenues are the result of crossborder transactions by cardholders that require currency conversion to settle the transactions between issuers and acquirers mastercard generally uses a wholesale rate increased by a certain percentage or a governmentmandated rate to convert transactions in foreign currencies into us dollars revenues from processing currency conversion transactions fluctuate with crossborder travel which is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  in addition to revenues associated with transaction processing we earn a significant portion of our revenues — approximately 37 in 2004 — from assessments on our customers calculated on the gdv on cards carrying our brands 

  regional transaction processing we provide transaction processing authorization clearing and settlement services for customers in the europe region through our subsidiary mastercard europe these services which allow european customers to facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout europe are provided via our european payment systems network “epsnet” for authorization services and european common clearing and settlement system “eccss” for clearing and settlement services we are presently in the midst of a multiyear technical convergence project to fully integrate eccss with our global clearing and settlement systems we also operate a separate regional processing facility for the asia pacific region in australia 

  outside of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most intracountry as opposed to crossborder transaction activity conducted with mastercard maestro and cirrus cards is authorized cleared andor settled by our customers or other processors without the involvement of mastercard’s central processing systems we do not earn transaction processing fees for such activity accordingly a significant portion of our nonus revenues are derived from processing crossborder transactions and therefore our business is dependent on trends in crossborder travel for example the recovery of crossborder travel in 2004 from the depressed levels in 2003 due to sars and the war in iraq was a significant source of our 2004 revenue growth as part of our strategy we are developing and promoting domestic processing solutions for our customers that are designed to leverage our significant investments in our global and regional processing systems during 2003 mastercard europe began authorizing and clearing transactions for the members of s2 limited formerly known as switch card services limited which operate an electronic domestic debit card network in the united kingdom under the switch® brand as part of an agreement to migrate switch branding to maestro by 2007 

   to facilitate our customerfocused strategy we have teams of employees dedicated to managing our relationships with our key customers we believe the coordinated high quality services provided by these teams is a significant advantage for mastercard that distinguishes us from our competitors we also seek to enter into business agreements with key customers through which we offer financial incentives and other financial support to issue and promote our cards these incentives often consist of a reduction in our volumebased fees and assessments for certain customers based on the achievement of gdv hurdles or other performance metrics 

  we believe that our business agreements with key customers have contributed to our strong volume and revenue growth in recent years and that these agreements will continue to drive our business performance in 2005 however as consolidation in the banking industry produces a smaller number of larger customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and other financial support in order to stay competitive which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  in 2004 jp morgan chase bank and its affiliates contributed to over 10 of our consolidated revenues net fees earned from jp morgan chase bank and its affiliates were approximately 315 million loss of a substantial amount of revenues from jp morgan chase bank and its affiliates could have a material adverse effect on our business see “risk factors”

7 others fees for its professional services at this time mastercard advisors does not make a significant contribution to our revenues

   our customers are responsible for fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or the merchants from whom they acquire transactions however we have implemented a series of programs and systems to aid our customers in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands generally we charge our customers fees for these antifraud programs and services we have a number of prevention initiatives targeted at fraudulent cardholder activity as well as programs targeted at merchant fraud security and cardholder authentication for remote channels are particularly critical issues facing mastercard’s customers and merchants who engage in electronic commerce transactions where a signed cardholder sales receipt is generally unavailable mastercard is seeking to address these issues through among other things the implementation of mastercard securecode tm  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer through the use of a unique personal code and site data protection a program that assists customers and online merchants in protecting electronic commerce sites from hacker intrusions and subsequent account data compromises 

marketing 

  we manage and promote the mastercard brand for the benefit of all customers through umbrella advertising promotional and sponsorship initiatives we strive to have our cardholders associate the mastercard brand with “the best way to pay for everything that matters®” our approach to marketing activities combines advertising sponsorships promotions interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated package designed to increase consumer awareness of mastercard and to drive usage of mastercard cards we also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by optimizing their use in individual countries while maintaining a common global theme our brand building initiatives which are conducted for our benefit as well as for the benefit of our customers represent a substantial portion of our overall expenses — approximately 41 in 2004 

  our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility usage and loyalty among cardholders globally our awardwinning “priceless®” advertising campaign launched in the united states in 1997 has run in 48 languages across 96 countries the “priceless” campaign promotes mastercard’s acceptance and usage benefits that permit cardholders to pay for what they need when they need it it also provides mastercard with a consistent recognizable message that supports our brand positioning in order to promote usage of our cards we also sponsor frequent promotions on a regional and national basis often in conjunction with merchants or our customers 

8   we seek to increase mastercard brand awareness and preference and to encourage card usage and loyalty by sponsoring a variety of sporting and entertainment properties that support the “priceless” campaign and mastercard brand positioning in soccer mastercard is the exclusive payment system sponsor of the fifa world cup which we believe is the single largest sporting event in the world we also sponsor other leading soccer events including the union of european football associations “uefa” european championship and the uefa champions league in europe in golf we are a sponsor and the preferred card of the pga tour the champions tour the pga of america the lpga the european pga tour the pga tour of australasia and other events in baseball we are the exclusive payments brand sponsor of major league baseball “mlb” we have also established separate marketing and sponsorship arrangements with over half of the mlb teams in football we have established sponsorship arrangements with the majority of the national football league teams finally as part of our marketing strategy in family entertainment we have a longterm sponsorship arrangement with certain business units of nbc universal that entitles mastercard to marketing and promotional programs with certain of universal’s motion picture theme park music and video properties 

merchant acceptance initiatives 

  based on information from our customers and other sources we estimate that at december 31 2004 cards carrying mastercard brands were accepted at over 24 million locations around the world acceptance locations include merchant locations atms and other locations where cash may be obtained 

  merchants are an important constituency in the mastercard payment system and we are working to further develop our relationships with them we believe that consolidation in the retail industry is producing a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope these merchants are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry including mastercard we believe that the growing role of merchants in the payments system represents both an opportunity and a challenge for mastercard on the one hand large merchants are supporting many of the legal and regulatory threats to interchange that mastercard is now defending since interchange represents a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards see “risk factors” in addition we may be required to increase the amount and scope of incentives that we provide to merchants to encourage the acceptance and usage of our cards which may adversely affect our business on the other hand we believe there are many opportunities to enhance our relationships with merchants and to continue to expand acceptance of our cards which provide numerous benefits to merchants for example in 2004 we made available directly to merchants those portions of our rules that apply to card acceptance and related activities and we continue to pursue multiple initiatives to encourage merchant acceptance of our cards 

  in the area of acceptance we aim to maintain the unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded programs by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the number of payment channels where mastercard programs are accepted such as by introducing mastercard acceptance in connection with remote payment applications second we seek to increase the number of categories of merchants that accept our programs we are focused presently on expanding acceptance in electronic commerce environments in fast throughput businesses such as fast food restaurants and in connection with public sector payments including those involving taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories third we seek to increase usage of our programs at selected merchants by sponsoring a range of promotional programs we also enter into arrangements with selected merchants under which these merchants provide incentives or discounts for the use of mastercardbranded programs or otherwise indicate a preference for mastercardbranded programs when accepting payments from consumers 

  we also support technical initiatives designed to make mastercard card acceptance more attractive for specific merchants such as our quick payment service for fast food restaurants and other merchants where rapid transactions are required mastercard paypass tm  a “contactless” payment solution that enables consumers simply to tap or wave their payment card on a specially equipped terminal is designed to help our customers grow their business by capturing transactions that were previously cashbased and increasing card activity on underutilized card accounts in 2004 mcdonald’s agreed to accept paypass at thousands of its 

9 locations in the united states paypass pilot programs have been expanded to include customers and merchants in the asiapacific region and canada 

  we view recurring payments as a significant opportunity to expand mastercard card acceptance and usage and we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make recurring bill payments in a variety of categories — including telephone cable utilities and insurance — on their mastercardbranded cards 

  finally we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and a marketing partner such as an airline or retail merchant affinity cards are similar to cobranded cards except that the issuer’s marketing partner is typically a charity educational or similar organization 

membership standards 

  we establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding membership in mastercard international and the use and acceptance of cards carrying our brands 

   membership in mastercard international and its affiliates is generally open only to banks and other regulated and supervised financial institutions applicants for membership must meet membership eligibility requirements and must be approved by the appropriate regional mastercard board of directors in general mastercard grants licenses by territory to applicants able to perform all obligations required of members licenses convey intellectual property rights to members including access to the network and usage of mastercard’s brands risk management reviews and antimoney laundering “aml” due diligence reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission as well as on existing members all applicants and members must meet the requirements of mastercard’s aml program 

  as a condition of our licenses members agree to comply with our bylaws policies rules and operating regulations “standards” mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce the standards the standards relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement member failures and allocation of losses 

  to help ensure that members conform to the standards we run a number of compliance programs including reviewing card programs proposed by members and requiring members to undergo an annual audit by an independent certified public accountant or similar examination by a regulatory authority to tailor mastercard’s programs and services to the needs of local markets our global andor regional boards have approved a number of variations to the standards applicable to specific regions 

   as a secondary obligor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2200 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 3000 affiliate debit licensees principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members approximately 21500 

  to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor principal members’ and affiliate debit licensees’ financial health economic and political operating environments and compliance with our rules and standards if the financial condition of a member or the state of a national economy in which a member operates indicates that a member may not be able to satisfy its mastercard settlement obligations to other members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of letters of credit and bank guarantees in the event that a member becomes unable or 

10 unwilling to meet its mastercard settlement andor program obligations we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral account in order to minimize any potential loss to our members or ourselves in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership 

  for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure we have established a 195 billion committed credit facility which is subject to annual renewal in addition we have the right to assess all or a portion of our members for reimbursement for settlement or any other operating losses subject to certain limitations set forth in the bylaws and other standards of mastercard for a description of our exposure to settlement and travelers cheque risk see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

enterprise risk management 

  mastercard faces a number of risks in operating its business for a description of material risks see “risk factors” the extent to which we effectively manage risk is critical to our financial condition and profitability managing risk is the responsibility of our business units and is an integral component of our business activities in 2004 a dedicated enterprise risk management group was created to provide risk management analysis support coordination and oversight across the organization through enterprise risk management we seek to identify assess mitigate and monitor key business risks in a consistent and disciplined manner 

intellectual property 

  we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard® maestro® and cirrus® through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our future business operations 

competition 

  mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house “ach” payments as a result of a global trend in which electronic forms of payment such as payment cards are increasingly displacing paper forms of payment we have gained market share versus cash and checks in recent years however cash and checks still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide transaction volume 

  the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards may be credit charge or deposit access cards within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa including plus electron and interlink american express and jcb among others in specific countries we face significant competition from other competitors such as discovernovus in the united states within the global general purpose card industry visa has significantly greater volume than we do in certain countries other competitors also have leading positions such as jcb in japan our deposit access programs also encounter substantial and increasingly intense competition from atm and pointofsale debit networks in various countries such as star nyce and pulse in the united states and interac in canada we also encounter competition from businesses such as retail stores and petroleum gasoline companies that issue their own payment cards 

  our competitors include operators of proprietary endtoend payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders such as american express 

11 these competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy among other things these competitors do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers because they have direct relationships with both merchants and cardholders interchange fees which are characteristics of fourparty payments systems such as ours are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide see “risk factors” because they do not utilize formal interchange fees operators of endtoend payment networks to date have avoided the same regulatory scrutiny we face and accordingly may enjoy a competitive advantage over fourparty payment systems 

  in addition ongoing litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit us merchants now have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states in addition as a result of the court’s decision in our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our competitive programs policy some of our customers may now do business with american express or discover in the united states which could adversely affect our business mbna corporation has already begun to issue american express cards to its customers and in december 2004 american express announced that it had reached an agreement for citibank to offer american express credit cards to citibank’s customers finally we are being sued in several state and federal courts because of our currency conversion practices the outcome of these lawsuits potentially could require us to change our currency conversion practices which may have a negative impact on our business we do not know what the final outcome will be of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings 

  in addition to proprietary endtoend networks we compete intensely with other bankcard associations principally visa for the loyalty of our customers in most countries throughout the world including the united states financial institutions typically issue both mastercard and visabranded payment cards as a result of this structure known as “duality” we compete with visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs in some countries particularly canada card issuers are “nondual” meaning that they issue either mastercard or visa payment cards but not both issuance of mastercard and visa debit cards is generally nondual in the united states as well due to visa’s historical debit exclusivity rule as a result of the litigation with the us department of justice visa’s debit exclusivity rule is no longer enforceable however visa enacted a bylaw that imposes a fee on its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states if they reduce their visa debit volume by more than 10 in nondual countries we compete with visa for the entire book of a customer’s business 

  over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat for mastercard because our business strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with visa or another competitor resulting in the loss of business for mastercard in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 

  in the united states we believe that mastercardbranded transactions account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low market penetration in the united states in recent years we believe that offline and online debit has grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions if we are unable to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states the reputation of our brands and overall business may suffer in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by atmdebit pointofsale networks as opposed to us 

12   we also face competition from transaction processors such as first data corporation some of which are seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services certain of these transaction processors including first data have significantly greater scale than we do which may provide them with a cost advantage over us in bidding for transaction processing business if these processors grow their transaction volumes more quickly than we do there is a risk that their scale advantages over us may accelerate and they could capture some of our core processing business similarly some of our competitors provide currency conversion services at the pointofsale through dynamic currency conversion or dcc which is an alternative to the mastercard currency conversion system these networks could reduce our transaction processing volumes which could adversely affect our revenues 

  we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems among other things these competitors provide internet currencies that can be used to buy and sell goods online “virtual checking” programs that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for online payments and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do 

  in mobile commerce we face competition from established network operators who today manage millions of consumer relationships and possess key advantages for facilitating payments across mobile devices whereas the mastercard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment account as established by their card issuer network operators may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the customer’s monthly bill 

  we believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive position in the global payments industry are 

 government regulation 

  government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many countries in which our cards are used in particular interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems such as mastercard’s are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

  mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is at times impacted by such regulations certain of mastercard’s operations are periodically reviewed by the federal financial institutions examination council in addition aspects of our operations or business may be subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium “nbb” pursuant to standards 

13 published by the european central bank the nbb’s oversight of mastercard europe is principally addressed at managing financial legal and operations risk 

  mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” the usa patriot act has required mastercard to create and implement a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and has imposed similar requirements on some of our customers 

employees 

  as of december 31 2004 we employed approximately 4000 persons of which approximately 1200 were employed outside the united states we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 

sec reports 

  our periodic reports filed with the us securities and exchange commission are available for review on our website at wwwmastercardintlcom the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report 

risk factors 

 interchange fees are the subject of increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may adversely affect our business 

  interchange fees are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay to accept payment cards and merchants and regulators are seeking to reduce these costs through litigation or regulatory action accordingly interchange fees including mastercard’s mifs are the subject of increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide for example in the european union the european commission has issued a statement of objections challenging mastercard’s crossborder mif under european union competition rules if mastercard is unsuccessful in obtaining a favorable ruling the european commission could order mastercard to change the manner in which it calculates its crossborder mif in the united kingdom the office of fair trading “oft” has issued a statement of objections under the uk competition act 1998 challenging the mastercard mif and multilateral service fee “msf” claiming that the mif and msf infringed uk competition law and do not qualify for an exemption in their present forms in australia the reserve bank of australia “rba” has enacted regulations which impose a number of changes on the operation of fourparty credit card systems in the united states a classaction suit has been filed by merchants alleging among other things that our interchange fees violate federal antitrust laws additional litigations with respect to interchange fees have also been threatened by merchants and plaintiffs’ lawyers in the united states interchange fees are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions including poland spain new zealand portugal mexico colombia south africa and switzerland we believe that regulators are increasingly adopting a coordinated approach to interchange matters as a result of which developments in any one jurisdiction may influence regulators’ approach to interchange in other jurisdictions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for a complete description of these proceedings we are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of mifs and to the other legal and regulatory challenges we face 

  if issuers are unable to collect interchange fees or are forced to reduce interchange fees they may be unable to recoup the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks such as those offered by american express or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also attempt to balance the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge if mastercard is less successful than visa in defending interchange fees we could also be competitively disadvantaged against visa in australia we believe that the rba’s regulations 

14 have already benefited our competitors operating proprietary endtoend networks if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of our and our members’ interchange fees regulation of interchange fees could have an adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business 

in addition to interchange fees the payments industry is the subject of increased regulatory focus in the united states and elsewhere which may impose costly new compliance burdens on mastercard and its customers and lead to decreased transaction volumes through mastercard’s systems 

  regulation of the payments industry including regulation applicable to mastercard and our customers has increased significantly in recent years for example in 2002 mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act the usa patriot act has required mastercard to create and implement a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and has imposed similar requirements on our customers the us congress is presently considering regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet gambling internet prescription drug purchases copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on mastercard or our customers most states in the us are considering a variety of legislation as well various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering identity theft account maintenance guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact our customers directly in 2004 a number of regulations were issued implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act or fact act which among other things makes permanent the preemptive effect of several key provisions of the fair credit reporting act that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses additional implementing regulations are anticipated in 2005 in addition privacy and data use and security are issues of sensitivity to regulators and legislators and we and our members could be impacted by attempts to regulate such issues 

  outside of the united states a number of jurisdictions have begun implementing legal frameworks to regulate their domestic payment systems for examples regulators in mexico and malaysia have recently been given statutory authority to regulate certain respects of the payments systems in those countries and similar initiatives have been proposed in singapore and elsewhere at present it is not possible to predict the impact of these developments on mastercard’s business or prospects 

  increased regulatory focus on mastercard may increase our costs which would negatively impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues and also negatively impact our financial performance 

 as a result of the court’s decision in our litigation with the us department of justice we have repealed our competitive programs policy and our business may suffer as a result 

  in 1998 the united states department of justice “doj” filed suit against mastercard international visa usa inc and visa international corp in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that certain aspects of the governance of mastercard and visa were unlawful and that mastercard’s competitive programs policy “cpp” and a visa bylaw provision that prohibited financial institutions participating in the respective associations from issuing competing proprietary payment cards such as american express or discover acted to restrain competition although we were successful in defending our governance structure at trial the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that our cpp and visa’s bylaw constituted unlawful restraints of trade under the us federal antitrust laws after the us supreme court denied our petition for certiorari on october 4 2004 thereby exhausting all avenues for further appeal in this case we repealed the cpp as a result our issuers are now permitted to issue general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network such as american express or discover the repeal of the cpp could cause our members to issue fewer cards with our brand and enter into arrangements with our competitors to issue cards thereby reducing the volume of transactions that we process mbna corporation has already begun to issue american express cards to its customers and in december 2004 american express announced that it had reached an agreement for citibank to offer american express credit cards to citibank’s customers similarly discover announced 

15 that ge finance will issue walmart branded cards that will run on the discover network accordingly the repeal of the cpp could have an adverse affect on our business and revenues see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

if we are found liable in any of the cases brought by american express or discover we may be forced to pay damages which may have an adverse effect on our revenues 

  after the supreme court denied our petition for a writ of certiorari of the decision in our litigation with the doj discover and american express respectively filed suit against mastercard incorporated mastercard international incorporated visa usa inc and visa international services association alleging that the cpp and visa’s bylaw provision caused each injury by unlawfully restraining trade under the us federal antitrust laws discover also alleges that it suffered injury by reason of mastercard’s rules which required merchants in the us to accept mastercardbranded debit cards if they accepted other mastercard products before these rules were modified as part of the us merchant lawsuit american express also names a number of member banks as codefendants 

  if we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits we may have to pay treble damages which could have an adverse effect on our business see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein for a description of these and our other material legal proceedings 

visa’s settlement service fee and the ability of us merchants to not accept mastercardbranded debit cards as a result of the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit card business in the united states 

  in june 2003 visa enacted a bylaw requiring its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states to pay a socalled “settlement service fee” if the issuers reduce their debit visa volume by more than 10 this bylaw was later modified to clarify that the settlement service fee would only be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of debit cards to mastercard visa implemented this bylaw provision following the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements herein for a description of mastercard’s response to this bylaw provision see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein if visa is permitted to impose this settlement service fee on issuers of debit cards according to this bylaw it would penalize visa members seeking to do debit business with mastercard and would effectively prohibit them from converting their debit card programs to the mastercard brand in addition under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa either of these scenarios would be detrimental to mastercard’s ability to maintain and grow its debit card business in the united states 

if we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices or if dynamic currency conversion services reduce the volume of foreign currency transactions we process our business may be adversely affected 

  we generate a significant amount of revenue from processing foreign currency transactions for members however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful a trial judge in california has found that our currency conversion practice is deceptive under california state law and ordered that we mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to california cardholders the final judgment and restitution process have been stayed pending mastercard’s appeal in addition we have been served with similar complaints in several state courts seeking to in effect extend the judge’s decision to mastercard cardholders outside of california we have succeeded in having several of these cases transferred to the us district court for the southern district of new york and combined with putative federal class actions alleging that our currency conversion practices violate federal antitrust laws see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

  if we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards in another country or may otherwise be required to modify our 

16 currency conversion practices in addition some of our competitors provide currency conversion services at the point of sale known as dynamic currency conversion or dcc which if chosen by the cardholder could replace our own currency conversion processing services if we are forced to change our pricing or practices for our currency conversion processing or if we process fewer transactions because of competing dcc services or otherwise our business would be adversely affected 

if we are found liable in any of the other material litigations that have been brought against us we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

  there are currently actions against mastercard international in 19 different state courts and the district of columbia in a number of these state courts there are multiple complaints against mastercard international brought under state unfair competition statutes on behalf of putative classes of consumers the claims in these actions mirror the allegations made in the us merchant lawsuit and assert that merchants faced with excessive merchant discount fees have passed these overcharges to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold the consumer class actions are not covered by the terms of the settlement agreement described in notes 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein in addition to these litigations we are also being sued in us district court for the eastern district of new york the superior court of california and in the district court of rhode island in connection with our assessment of chargeback transactions we may also be sued in the future in the united states or in other jurisdictions by our customers merchants or consumers for substantial damages or injunctive relief in connection with our business practices 

  if we are unsuccessful in our defense against the consumer class actions the merchant chargeback litigations or any other material litigation we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices and pricing structure any of which could have an adverse affect on our business see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements herein for a description of these and our other material legal proceedings 

 we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands some of our competitors are larger or have greater financial resources than we do in addition continued consolidation in the banking industry is producing a smaller number of larger customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard in addition we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives also as merchants consolidate and become increasingly larger we may be required to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to merchants to date our rapid overall volume growth has allowed us to mitigate the impact of pricing reductions or incentive increases however we may not be able to process additional transaction volume or provide additional services to our customers to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not be successful in these efforts 

global economic political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in crossborder travel which may significantly impact our revenues and profitability 

  the global payments industry is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands in addition a significant portion of the volume generated on cards carrying our brands and a 

17 significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the united states are associated with crossborder business and leisure travel which may be adversely affected by world geopolitical and other conditions in particular revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross border travel and are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are significantly dependent on our relationships with our customers to manage the mastercard payment system if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our customers or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or with the merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be adversely affected 

  we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services most of our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services in particular the payments industry is currently undergoing significant consolidations and the merger of one or more of our customers with financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in 2004 jp morgan chase bank and its affiliates contributed over 10 of our consolidated revenues loss of business from jp morgan chase bank or another large customer could adversely affect our business 

  our business strategy calls for us to grow our business by among other things entering into customized agreements with customers around the globe like our other customer relationships these agreements are terminable by our customers in a variety of circumstances 

  a number of our key customers are represented on our board of directors if any one of these customers were to lose its representation on the board this could have a detrimental effect on our business relationship with that customer conversely a number of customers from which we earn substantial revenues are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of revenues or transaction volumes from these customers could have an adverse impact on our business 

  in addition until october 15 2006 we are required to permit issuers with which we have entered into business agreements in the united states before october 15 2004 to terminate those agreements without penalty in order to enter into agreements with american express or discover as a result of the antitrust litigation that was brought against us by the doj which is described in a separate risk factor above accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 

  we do not issue cards set cardholder fees or determine the interest rates if applicable charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each mastercard issuer is responsible for determining these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not solicit merchants to process transactions or establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which are responsibilities of our acquirers as a result much of our business depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our customers in turn our customers’ success is dependent upon a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

  outside of the united states and a select number of other jurisdictions most incountry as opposed to crossborder transaction activity conducted with mastercard maestro and cirrus cards is authorized cleared and settled by our customers or other processors without the involvement of mastercard’s central processing systems because we do not provide domestic processing services in these countries and do not as described above have direct relationships with cardholders or merchants we are dependent on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage the mastercard brand together with the perception of the mastercard payment system among regulators merchants and consumers in these countries from time to time our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of the mastercard payment system overall which may adversely impact our business 

18   we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although it is our business strategy to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer 

our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

  the global payments industry is highly competitive some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have we may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these threats in addition as discussed under the heading “competition” our business faces a number of specific and increasingly intense competitive pressures worldwide we may not be able to continue to effectively address these competitive pressures in the future as a result our revenues or income may decline 

as a secondary obligor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss in the event that any of our members default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations 

  mastercard settlement exposure materializes when an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical reasons liquidity shortfall insolvency or other reasons we quantify each member’s settlement credit risk exposure by estimating the dollar value of issuing and chargeback transactions that we would have to fund in order to satisfy such member’s mastercard maestro or cirrusrelated obligations to other members if a principal member or affiliate debit licensee is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other members we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not contractually obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole in the event that an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations in order to maintain the integrity and acceptance of our brands accordingly one or more member defaults could expose us to significant losses and reduce our net income for more information on our settlement exposure see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of mastercardbranded cards could decline which would reduce our revenues and income 

  the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes such as continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and to provide endtoend payment solutions for our customers 

if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions securely efficiently or at all our revenues or income would be materially reduced 

  our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access terrorism or accident most of our transaction processing systems are operated out of a single facility supported by a separate coprocessing facility a natural disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services additionally we rely on third party service providers such as att for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we 

19 require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services and adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and our revenues or income 

  in addition our security protection measures including with respect to the security of transaction information processed on our systems or the systems or processing technology of third parties participating in our network may not be sufficient to prevent the fraudulent or other improper use of cards carrying our brands unauthorized use of our network potentially could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or transmitted by our customers or others these factors may result in liabilities for us or our customers and could reduce our revenues and income 

adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenues we receive from our international operations 

  during 2004 approximately 42 of our revenues were generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenues we generate outside the united states are subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of international currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could have a adverse impact on our business

overview 

  our corporate strategy has been to focus on our key customers to drive our business growth to strengthen our brands technology and acceptance network and to differentiate mastercard from our competition by developing innovative payment solutions and customized consulting services we remain committed to this strategic direction and have begun to implement initiatives to expand our customerfocused approach to a broader group of customers as well as to further develop relationships with merchants that accept our cards we will also seek to leverage our expertise in payment programs consulting services brand marketing technology and processing to expand the valueadded services we provide our customers we also intend to proactively address the legal regulatory and other industry risks that impact our business 

  in a challenging operating environment with legal economic and industry pressures we were able to exceed our planned revenue growth and attain our expense objectives in 2004 we achieved doubledigit revenue growth of 14 in 2004 from the comparable period in 2003 adjusted for a 2 impact of favorable foreign currency fluctuation against the euro the increase in revenue was due to higher gross dollar volume “gdv” and more transactions processed by mastercard primarily from the expansion of our customer relationships economic recovery in many countries and higher crossborder travel in 2003 our revenues were negatively impacted by the war in iraq the sars outbreak reduced travel and a general economic slowdown worldwide during 2004 we continued to realign our operations and limit the growth of our operating expenses through successful vendor negotiations our operating expenses increased 7 in 2004 excluding the impact of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements of which 1 was due to the impact of acquisitions during 2004 in 2004 the translation of mastercard europe’s operating results from euro into us dollar combined with the devaluation of the us dollar compared to the euro resulted in a 2 increase in both revenues and operating expenses compared to 2003 we reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of 

23 total revenues to 86 from 93 in 2003 excluding the impact of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 

  our financial position reflects strong liquidity we have 11 billion in cash cash equivalents and available for sale securities and 975 million in stockholders’ equity as of december 31 2004 we intend to continue to focus on building our financial position we believe our cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard in 2005 

  we successfully completed our sarbanesoxley 404 testing one year ahead of the required deadline for nonaccelerated filers with the us securities and exchange commission the consolidated financial statements herein include a report from management which concludes that based on our assessment our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of december 31 2004 

results of operations 

  

 — not meaningful 

  the acquisition of mastercard europe formerly europay international sa “epi” on june 28 2002 affected the comparability of our financial data the results of mastercard europe’s operations have 

24 been included in our consolidated statements of operations from june 28 2002 however mastercard europe’s gdv and transactions are included in all periods 

   our operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates quarterly assessment fees are calculated based on local dollar volume which is converted to us dollar volume using average exchange rates for the quarter in 2004 the increase in gdv of 14 on a us dollar converted basis exceeded local gdv growth of 11 resulting in increased assessment revenues due to the devaluation of the us dollar in addition consumer behavior particularly international travel and purchases varies with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  we are especially impacted by the movements of the euro to the us dollar since mastercard europe’s functional currency is the euro the devaluation of the us dollar against the euro and the impact of the translation of mastercard europe’s operating results into us dollar amounts are summarized below 

  

 revenues 

  our revenues are generated from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services and from assessments calculated on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands we establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer transactions on a global basis we do not issue cards set fees or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on cards carrying our brands our issuing customers have the responsibility for determining these and most other competitive card features our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance 

  mastercard enters into business agreements with certain customers that provide for fee rebates when those customers meet certain performance based criteria such rebates are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the discounted rates for the services provided in addition mastercard enters into agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide gdvbased and other performance support incentives rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned or the performance has occurred 

  the us remains our largest geographic market based on revenues however international revenues grew at a faster rate than us revenues in 2004 particularly in the european region accordingly revenue generated in the us was approximately 58 63 and 61 of total revenues in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the growth in the european region is primarily due to new assessment revenue streams and increased transactions no individual country other than the us generated more than 10 of total revenues in either period 

  in addition to the expansion of our business relationships and the global recovery in crossborder travel we believe that our 2004 revenue growth was positively impacted by the worldwide trend in which payments are migrating from paperbased forms to electronic forms such as payment cards this trend has helped drive our volume and revenue growth for a number of years and we expect it to continue in 2005 however we expect our net revenue growth in 2005 to be moderated by pricing arrangements with certain large customers 

25 these pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry and the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers and merchants 

   operations fees primarily represent user fees for authorization clearing settlement and other payment services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis operations fees increased 206 million or 14 in 2004 and 199 million or 16 in 2003 in each case compared to the prior year the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 111 million or 56 of the increase in operations fees in 2003 the significant changes in operations fees were as follows 

 

 26 

 assessments 

  assessments are charges that are calculated based on our customers’ gdv gdv represents gross usage purchase and cash disbursements on cards carrying our brands for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks in 2004 and 2003 assessments revenue grew 156 million or 20 and 140 million or 21 respectively gdv growth was 11 and 6 in 2004 and 2003 respectively when measured in local currency and 14 and 10 respectively when measured on a us dollar converted basis the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 94 million or 68 of the increase in assessments in 2003 excluding mastercard europe assessments revenue growth was 8 in 2003 

  in addition to the increase in gdv assessments grew due to the following factors 

   as described above rebates and incentives provided to our customers and merchants increased in 2004 and 2003 these rebates and incentives reduce revenue moderate assessments growth and are generally based on gdv as well as a fixed component for the issuance of new cards or the launch of new programs rebates and incentives increased 29 million and 72 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 29 and 31 in 2004 and 2003 respectively during 2004 and 2003 we increased the incentives offered to certain customers and merchants to promote usage and acceptance of our brands additionally the increase in rebates in 2003 can be attributed to the addition of new member contracts by mastercard europe subsequent to its acquisition by mastercard 

27 operating expenses 

  our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses in 2004 there was a decrease in operating expenses of 587 million or 21 compared to the prior year excluding the charges to earnings related to the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements there would have been an increase in operating expenses of 154 million or 7 in 2004 compared to the prior year approximately 31 million of the increase in 2004 related to the acquisition of the two consulting firms described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements herein in 2003 there was an increase in operating expenses of 11 billion or 62 compared to the prior year of which 763 million or 70 was a result of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and 197 million or 18 was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe 

   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel professional fees data processing telecommunications and travel in 2004 and 2003 these activities accounted for approximately 46 and 49 of total revenues respectively general and administrative expenses increased 87 million in 2004 and 134 million in 2003 primarily due to increases in personnel expenses the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 110 million or 82 of the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2003 the major components of changes in general and administrative expenses are as follows 

 

 28 

   advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships which promote our brand and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands in 2004 and 2003 these activities accounted for approximately 35 and 38 of total revenues respectively advertising and market development expenses increased 65 million or 8 in 2004 and 157 million or 23 in 2003 the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 70 million or 45 of the increase in advertising and market development expenses in 2003 

  our brands principally mastercard are valuable strategic assets which convey symbols that can be readily identified by our customers as well as our cardholders creating value for our business our advertising and marketing efforts are focused on ensuring that our services are identified communicated and marketed in a clear efficient and consistent manner not only on a local level but also on a global scale we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our mastercard brand reputation image and ultimate value our “priceless” campaign has run in 96 countries and 48 languages and we continue to invest significantly in this campaign in 2004 increased media advertising occurred in our european region in addition mastercard has corporate sponsorships and conducts promotions to generate usage of cards carrying our brands during 2004 and 2003 we sponsored the uefa champions league certain national football league teams major league baseball the professional golf association and universal studios 

  mastercard implemented a fouryear plan in 2002 to accelerate our growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard and its customers by significantly expanding its spending in advertising and market development for the year ended december 31 2004 and 2003 we spent 192 million and 152 million on advertising and marketing relating to this plan the primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition promote brand acceptance and enhance the development of our programs and services in certain markets we will continue to evaluate the extent of these initiatives in light of changing market conditions 

   in the first quarter of 2003 we recorded a pretax charge of 721 million 469 million aftertax consisting of i the monetary amount of the us merchant lawsuit settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant lawsuit settlement and iii costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit the 721 million pretax charge amount was an estimate which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the us merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors in addition other legal settlements were made in 2004 and 2003 total liabilities for the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements changed as follows 

 29 

   depreciation and amortization expenses increased 2 million in 2004 and 29 million in 2003 in 2003 depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly due to the acquisition of mastercard europe as well as additional capitalized computer software the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 17 million or 59 of the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2003 

  our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions this technology is continuously updated and improved therefore our investment in capitalized software and related amortization also continues to increase in recent years we have made the following significant changes to our technology and technology centers which have caused an increase in our depreciation and amortization 

 

   other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income and interest expense investment income decreased 8 million in 2004 and increased 31 million in 2003 the decrease in 2004 resulted from a decline in the market value of our trading securities portfolio the increase in 2003 was primarily due to the consolidation of the variable interest entity see the discussion in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements herein and appreciation of the market value of our trading securities portfolio interest expense increased 7 million and 53 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively primarily due to interest expense of 51 million and 43 million respectively related to imputed interest on the us merchant lawsuit settlement in addition in 2003 the consolidation of the variable interest entity increased interest expense 

   the effective income tax expense benefit rate for years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 was 265 361 and 265 respectively the decrease in the rate in 2004 was primarily attributable to the settlement and reassessment of various tax audit matters the filing and recognition of refund claims and a onetime increase in our deferred state tax assets as a result of additional income subject to higher state and local tax rates the 2003 tax benefit was primarily driven by the us merchant lawsuit settlement the amount of the litigation settlement and its impact on pretax income was so large that the permanent differences did not significantly affect the tax rate resulting in a tax benefit at the highest marginal rate the increase in the rate from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to a onetime revaluation in 2002 of mastercard europe’s deferred tax liabilities due to the reduction in the belgium statutory tax rate from 402 to 340 in december 2002 the components impacting the effective tax rate are 

 31 liquidity 

  we believe our ability to generate cash to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths we need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development to provide for credit and settlement risk to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit at december 31 2004 we had 11 billion of cash cash equivalents and available for sale securities with which to manage operations compared to 880 million at december 31 2003 we expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital needs in 2005 in addition we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard in 2005 however our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “legal regulatory and other industry risks” 

  

 — not meaningful 

  net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 and 2003 was generated principally by current period earnings losses exclusive of noncash charges for depreciation and amortization and legal settlements the liabilities related to the us merchant lawsuit settlement and other legal settlements discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements herein will be funded through existing cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity we recorded expense of 22 million and 763 million for legal settlement costs in 2004 and 2003 respectively and had related cash payments totaling 149 million and 134 million respectively 

  the utilization of cash for investing activities in 2004 was primarily due to purchases of availableforsale securities and the acquisition of certain businesses as described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements herein in 2004 and 2003 we also invested in the internal development of capitalized software and purchase of fixed assets to support our business our capitalized software is essential to providing payment card transaction processing to our customers through our proprietary global computer and telecommunications system our investing activities in 2003 included funding for a coprocessing facility in kansas city missouri and associated equipment 

  in addition to our liquid investments we provide for liquidity through a committed 195 billion revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with certain financial institutions which expires on june 17 2005 the credit facility replaced mastercard incorporated’s prior 12 billion credit facility which expired on june 18 2004 borrowings under the credit facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by mastercard international members and subject to a limit of 300 million for general corporate purposes interest on borrowings under the credit facility is charged at the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 28 basis points an additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate 

32 borrowings under the credit facility exceed 33 of the commitments mastercard agreed to pay a facility fee which varies based on mastercard’s credit rating and is currently equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment mastercard was in compliance with the credit facility covenants as of december 31 2004 there were no borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2004 the majority of credit facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of mastercard international 

  due to standard  poor’s assessment of mastercard’s vulnerability to legal risk on may 16 2003 standard  poor’s lowered mastercard’s counterparty credit rating to aa2 subordinated debt rating to bbb and placed mastercard on negative outlook these ratings were reaffirmed in 2004 this rating has not materially impacted our liquidity 

legal regulatory and other industry risks 

  our business has many industry risks most significantly the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate these risks have increased in recent years although we are proactively seeking to address them for a complete description of the risks facing our business see “risk factors” in item 1 — business of this report the following risks among others may have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 33 future obligations 

  the following table summarizes as of december 31 2004 our obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances 

  

 member relationships and related parties 

  we have a diversified member base of approximately 2200 principal members and approximately 21500 affiliate members our stockholders are principal members of mastercard international in the normal course of business we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of mastercard international 

  one customer jp morgan chase bank generated 12 of our revenue in 2004 in addition certain other customers generate in excess of five percent of our revenue the loss of any of these members could adversely impact mastercard’s net income in addition as part of our business initiative to grow our business mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with members these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances under certain circumstances we may be required to permit members in the united states that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the antitrust litigation brought against us by the us department of justice any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition however we believe 

34 that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

critical accounting estimates 

  our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

 35  36  37 recent accounting pronouncements 

  in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 132 revised 2003 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 and 106” “sfas 132” this statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas no 88 “employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” sfas 132 requires additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans we have fully implemented sfas 132 for the year ended december 31 2004 

  in march 2004 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on eitf issue no 0301 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” “eitf 0301” eitf 0301 provides guidance to determine whether an otherthantemporary impairment exists for availableforsale or heldtomaturity investments under sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity investments” and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method eitf 0301 also requires certain disclosures related to investments that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date the fasb has indefinitely deferred the recognition and measurement guidance in eitf 0301 through fasb staff position “fsp” no eitf issue 0311 we have fully implemented all of the required disclosures for the year ended december 31 2004 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1092 “fsp 1092” “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” the “act” fsp 1092 provides enterprises more time beyond the financialreporting period during which the act took effect to evaluate the act’s impact on the enterprise’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas 109 “accounting for income taxes” we are not intending to repatriate under the act therefore fsp 1092 is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies which have been approved by the board of directors governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis there have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2004 as compared to december 31 2003 

foreign exchange risk 

  we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months 

  at december 31 2004 and 2003 forward currency contracts against the us dollar were both purchased with notional amounts of 41 million and 64 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 20 million and 60 million respectively based on the yearend 2004 and 2003 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at 20 million and 04 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

38   at december 31 2004 and 2003 forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased with notional amounts of 128 million and 178 million respectively based on the yearend 2004 and 2003 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at 11 million and 16 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the us dollar or one of seventeen other stable transaction currencies the remaining 143 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure 

interest rate risk 

  our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as availableforsale investments they are rated aa or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and mediumterm instruments with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure based on the net present value of expected future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in interest rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of 17 million for each of 2004 and 2003 respectively our heldtomaturity investments are not be subject to interest rate movements 

  our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities a 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of 9 million and 12 million for december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

  at december 31 2004 and 2003 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement there were no amounts outstanding at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively under these credit facilities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements herein 

equity price risk 

  we own trading securities which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of 3 million in each of the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively to the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense

mastercard international our business is structured as an open bankcard association in which cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers our customers are the principal and affiliate members of mastercard international which we refer to collectively as our “customers” or “members” accordingly we do not issue cards set cardholder fees or determine the interest rates if applicable charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands we refer to the customers that issue our cards as “issuers” and those that enroll merchants into programs to accept our cards as “acquirers”   because our business is global we have structured our organization to be sensitive to the requirements of the regions and countries in which we operate our global board of directors has delegated authority over a variety of matters including certain rulemaking enforcement and feesetting decisions to regional boards of directors covering each of asia pacific canada europe latin america and the caribbean south asia — middle east africa “samea” and the united states we enter into business agreements with key customers around the globe which allow us to support the individual needs of these customers with tailored pricing and other business arrangements in exchange for significant volume share and other commitments to mastercard at the same time we seek to provide bestinclass service to all of our customers irrespective of their size   we establish a multilateral interchange fee “mif” in certain circumstances as a default fee that applies when there is no other interchange fee arrangement in place between an issuer and an acquirer interchange fees represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as ours generally interchange fees are paid by acquirers to issuers in connection with transactions initiated with our cards these fees reimburse the issuer for a portion of the costs 1 incurred by it in providing services which are of benefit to all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants we establish a variety of mif rates depending on such considerations as the location and the type of transaction and collect the mif on behalf of the institutions entitled to receive it as described more fully below in “risk factors — interchange fees are the subject of increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may adversely affect our business” mifs are subject to regulatory or legal review andor challenges in a number of jurisdictions

   as a secondary obligor of certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any of our approximately 2600 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 2300 affiliate debit licensees principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members numbering approximately 22300 in total   to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor principal members’ and affiliate debit licensees’ financial health economic and political operating environments and compliance with our rules and standards if the financial condition of a member or the state of a national economy in which a member operates indicates that a member may not be able to satisfy its mastercard settlement obligations to other members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral typically in the form of letters of credit and bank guarantees in the event that a member becomes unable or unwilling to meet its mastercard settlement andor program obligations we are able to draw upon such member’s collateral account in order to keep ourselves and other members from incurring losses in addition to obtaining collateral from members in situations where a member is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us or other members we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership   for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure we have established a 12 billion committed credit facility which is subject to annual renewal in addition we have the right to assess all or a portion of our members for reimbursement for settlement or any other operating losses subject to certain limitations set forth in the bylaws and other standards of mastercard for a description of our exposure to settlement and travelers cheque risk see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included herein intellectual property   we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard® maestro® and cirrus® through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses in addition we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards security systems and other matters some of which may be important to our future business operations competition   mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house “ach” payments while we have gained share versus cash and checks in recent years these forms of payment still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide transaction volume within the global general purpose card industry we believe that visa may have significantly greater volume than us in certain countries other competitors also have leading positions such as jcb in japan   the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards may be credit charge or deposit access cards within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa including plus electron and interlink american express jcb diners club and carte blanche among others in specific countries we face significant competition from other competitors such as discover novus united states interac canada and bankcard and eftpos australia we also encounter competition from businesses such as retail stores and petroleum gasoline companies that issue their own payment cards as well as from atm pointofsale networks such as nyce star pulse and others 11   our competitors include operators of proprietary endtoend payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders such as american express these competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy among other things these competitors do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs among issuers and acquirers because they have direct relationships with both merchants and cardholders interchange fees which are characteristics of fourparty payments systems such as ours are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for information regarding interchange fees and the related regulatory challenges because they do not utilize formal interchange fees operators of endtoend payment networks to date have avoided the same regulatory scrutiny we face and accordingly may enjoy a competitive advantage over fourparty payment systems such as ours   in addition ongoing litigation has and may continue to affect our ability to compete in the global payments industry see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit us merchants now have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards issued in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards which may adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states following the settlement a small number of merchants including walmart have announced that they will no longer accept mastercardbranded debit cards in addition if we ultimately are unsuccessful in our litigation with the us department of justice concerning our competitive programs policy some of our customers may choose to do business with american express or discover which would adversely affect our business on january 29 2004 mbna corporation announced its intention to offer american express credit cards to its customers finally we are being sued in several state and federal courts because of our currency conversion practices the outcome of these lawsuits potentially could require us to change our currency conversion practices which may have a negative impact on our business we do not know what the final outcome will be of our various litigations and other regulatory proceedings   in addition to proprietary endtoend networks we compete intensely with other bankcard associations principally visa for the loyalty of our customers in most countries throughout the world including the united states financial institutions typically issue both mastercard and visabranded payment cards as a result of this structure known as “duality” we compete with visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs in some countries particularly canada card issuers are “nondual” meaning that they issue either mastercard or visa payment cards but not both issuance of mastercard and visa debit cards is generally nondual in the united states as well in nondual countries we compete with visa for the entire book of a customer’s business significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with visa resulting in the loss of business for mastercard in particular in the first quarter of 2004 jp morgan chase the parent of one of our largest principal members and stockholders announced its intention to acquire bankone a financial institution principally aligned with visa the loss of a material portion of our current business with chase as a result of this transaction could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and business prospects   in the united states we believe that mastercardbranded transactions account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low market penetration in the united states in recent years we believe that offline and online debit has grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions if we are unable to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states the reputation of our brands and overall business may suffer in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by atm debit pointofsale networks as opposed to us   we also face competition from transaction processors such as first data corporation some of which are seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services in particular we believe that first data’s acquisition of concord efs 12 will enable first data to process significant debit transaction volumes similarly some of our competitors provide currency conversion services at the pointofsale through dynamic currency conversion or dcc which is an alternative to the mastercard currency conversion system these networks could reduce our transaction processing volumes which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues 

  we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems among other things these competitors provide internet currencies that can be used to buy and sell goods online “virtual checking” programs that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for online payments and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do   in mobile commerce we face competition from established network operators who today manage millions of consumer relationships and possess key advantages for facilitating payments across mobile devices whereas the mastercard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment account as established by their card issuer network operators may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the customer’s monthly bill   we believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive position in the global payments industry are  government regulation   government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payment industry in the many jurisdictions in which our cards are used in particular interchange fees associated with fourparty payment systems such as mastercard’s are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein   mastercard is subject to a variety of employment health and safety environmental and other forms of government regulation in the ordinary course of its business mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is at times impacted by such regulations certain of mastercard’s operations are periodically reviewed by the federal financial institutions examination council in addition aspects of our operations or business may be subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us treasury’s office of foreign assets control mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and effective in 2003 is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium “nbb” pursuant to standards published by the european central bank the nbb’s oversight of mastercard europe is principally addressed at managing financial legal and operations risk   mastercard and other participants in the payment industry are subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” the usa patriot act has 13 required mastercard to create and implement a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and has imposed similar requirements on some of our customers 

employees   as of december 31 2003 we employed approximately 4000 persons of which approximately 1200 were employed outside the united states we consider our relationship with our employees to be good sec reports   our periodic reports filed with the us securities and exchange commission are available for review on our website at wwwmastercardintlcom the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report risk factors interchange fees are the subject of increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide which may adversely affect our business   interchange fees including mastercard’s mifs are the subject of increasingly intense regulatory scrutiny worldwide for example in the european union the european commission has issued a statement of objections challenging mastercard’s crossborder mif under european union competition rules if mastercard is unsuccessful in obtaining an exemption to these rules the european commission could order mastercard to change the manner in which it calculates its crossborder mif in the united kingdom the office of fair trading “oft” has issued a rule 14 notice under the uk competition act 1998 challenging the mastercard mif and multilateral service fee “msf” claiming that the mif and msf may infringe uk competition law and do not qualify for an exemption in their present forms in australia the reserve bank of australia “rba” has enacted regulations which impose a number of changes on the operation of fourparty credit card systems in the united states a classaction suit has been filed by merchants alleging among other things that our interchange fees violate federal antitrust laws interchange fees are also being reviewed in a number of other jurisdictions including poland spain new zealand and switzerland see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for a complete description of these proceedings   if issuers are unable to charge interchange fees or are forced to reduce interchange fees they may be unable to recoup the costs incurred for their services this could reduce the number of financial institutions willing to participate in a fourparty payment card system lower overall transaction volumes andor make proprietary endtoend networks such as those offered by american express and diners club or other forms of payment more attractive issuers could also attempt to balance the expense of their card programs by seeking a reduction in the fees that we charge if mastercard is less successful than visa in defending interchange fees we could also be competitively disadvantaged against visa in australia we believe that the rba’s regulations have already benefited our competitors operating proprietary endtoend networks if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of our and our members’ interchange fees regulation of interchange fees could have an adverse impact on our revenues our prospects for future growth and our overall business in addition to interchange fees the payments industry is the subject of increased regulatory focus in the united states and elsewhere which may impose costly new compliance burdens on mastercard and its customers and lead to decreased transaction volumes through mastercard’s systems   regulation of the payments industry including regulation applicable to mastercard and our customers has increased significantly in recent years for example in 2002 mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act the usa patriot act has required mastercard to create and implement a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and has imposed similar requirements on our customers the us congress is presently considering regulatory initiatives in the areas of internet gambling internet prescription drug purchases and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burdens on mastercard or our customers most states in the us are considering a 14 variety of legislation as well various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering identity theft account maintenance guidelines privacy disclosure rules and account breach notification that would impact our customers directly in 2004 a number of regulations will be issued implementing the fair and accurate credit transactions act or fact act which among other things makes permanent the preemptive effect of several key provisions of the fair credit reporting act that could have a material impact on our customers’ businesses increased regulatory focus on mastercard may increase our costs which would negatively impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues and also negatively impact our financial performance 

our business may be adversely impacted by the european union’s adoption of regulation on crossborder payments denominated in euros   in december 2001 the european parliament and the council of the european union adopted a new regulation requiring that bank charges for crossborder payments denominated in euros be the same as for similar transactions within a single member state this regulation is being adopted incrementally through january 2006 payments in noneuro currencies will also be subject to the regulation if the member states where those currencies are used notify the european commission that they want the rules to apply because a reduction in crossborder transaction fees will reduce the profitability of certain services offered by mastercard’s european customers it may cause them to modify or withdraw these services if such changes result in an overall decline in transaction volumes our revenues from european operations may decline visa’s settlement service fee and the ability of us merchants to not accept mastercardbranded debit cards as a result of the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our debit card business in the united states   in june 2003 visa enacted a bylaw requiring its 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states to pay a socalled “settlement service fee” if the issuers reduce their debit visa volume by more than 10 this bylaw was later modified to clarify that the settlement service fee would only be imposed if an issuer shifted its portfolio of debit cards to mastercard visa implemented this bylaw provision following the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit described in item 3 — legal proceedings for a description of mastercard’s response to this bylaw provision see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein if visa is permitted to impose this settlement service fee on issuers of debit cards according to this bylaw it would penalize visa members seeking to do debit business with mastercard and would effectively prevent them from converting their debit card programs to the mastercard brand in addition under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit merchants have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa to date a small number of merchants including a walmart have announced that they will no longer accept mastercardbranded debit cards either of these scenarios would be detrimental to mastercard’s ability to maintain and grow its debit card business in the united states if we ultimately are unsuccessful in our litigation with the us department of justice our competitive programs policy would be repealed and our business may suffer   in 1998 the united states department of justice “doj” filed suit against mastercard international visa usa inc and visa international corp in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that certain aspects of the governance of mastercard and visa were unlawful and that mastercard’s competitive programs policy “cpp” and a visa bylaw provision that prohibit financial institutions participating in the respective associations from issuing competing proprietary payment cards such as american express or discover acted to restrain competition although we were successful in defending our governance structure at trial the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the trial court judge’s ruling that our cpp and visa’s bylaw constitute unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws we will petition the us supreme court for a writ of certiorari requesting that it review the decision of the second circuit if we ultimately lose our appeal we would be forced to repeal the cpp insofar as it applies to issuers and would be prevented from enacting or enforcing any bylaw rule policy or practice that prohibits our issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose 15 card network such as american express or discover a repeal of the cpp could cause our members to issue fewer cards with our brand and enter into arrangements with our competitors to issue cards thereby reducing the volume of transactions that we process on january 29 2004 mbna corporation announced its intention to offer american express credit cards to its customers in addition for a period of two years we would also be required to permit any issuer with which we entered into a longterm business agreement related to mastercardbranded cards to terminate such agreements without penalty provided that the reason for the termination is to permit the issuer to enter into agreements with american express or discover accordingly a repeal of the cpp would have an adverse affect on our business and revenues we cannot predict the final outcome of our lawsuit with the doj see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

if we lose any of our various lawsuits relating to our currency conversion practices our business would be adversely affected   we generate a significant amount of revenue from processing foreign currency transactions for members however we are defendants in several state and federal lawsuits alleging that our currency conversion practices are deceptive anticompetitive or otherwise unlawful a trial judge in california has found that our currency conversion practice is deceptive under california state law and ordered that we mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to california cardholders on december 29 2003 we filed a notice of appeal in addition we have been served with similar complaints in several state courts seeking to in effect extend the judge’s decision to mastercard cardholders outside of california we have succeeded in having several of these cases transferred to the us district court for the southern district of new york and combined with putative federal class actions alleging that our currency conversion practices violate federal antitrust laws see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein   if we are unsuccessful in defending against these lawsuits we may have to pay restitution to cardholders who make claims that they used their cards abroad or may otherwise be required to modify our currency conversion practices in addition some of our competitors provide pointofsale currency conversion services which if chosen by the cardholder could disintermediate our services from the relevant transaction if we are forced to change our pricing or practices for our currency conversion processing or if we process fewer transactions because of competing services or otherwise our business would be adversely affected if we are found liable in any of the other material litigations that have been brought against us we may be forced to pay damages and change our business practices or pricing structure any of which could have an adverse affect on our revenues   there are currently actions against mastercard international in 18 different state courts and the district of columbia in a number of these state courts there are multiple complaints against mastercard international brought under state unfair competition statutes on behalf of putative classes of consumers the claims in these actions mirror the allegations made in the us merchant lawsuit and assert that merchants faced with excessive merchant discount fees have passed these overcharges to consumers in the form of higher prices on goods and services sold also several lawsuits have been commenced by merchants who have opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the us merchant lawsuit neither the consumer class actions nor the “opt out” merchant litigations described above are covered by the terms of the settlement agreement described in item 3 — legal proceedings in addition to these litigations we are also being sued in us district court for the eastern district of new york and in the superior court of california in connection with our assessment of chargeback transactions we may also be sued in the future by our customers merchants or consumers for substantial damages or injunctive relief in connection with our business practices   if we are unsuccessful in our defense against the consumer class actions the “opt out” merchant lawsuits the merchant chargeback litigations or any other material litigation we may be forced to pay damages andor change our business practices and pricing structure any of which could have an adverse affect on our business see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a description of these and our other material legal proceedings 16 we face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability   mastercard generates revenues from the fees that it charges its customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands some of our competitors are larger or have greater financial resources than we do in addition continued consolidation in the banking industry is producing a smaller number of larger customers which generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts with mastercard accordingly we may be forced to limit the growth of or lower our fees and assessments in addition we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our cards in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentives to date our rapid overall volume growth has allowed us to mitigate the impact of pricing reductions or incentive increases however we may not be able to process additional transaction volume or provide additional services to our customers to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability in addition increased pressure on prices enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives we may not be successful in these efforts if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our customers or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or with the merchants that accept our cards for payment our business may be adversely affected   we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on a number of relationships with other parties principally our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services most of our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of our customers our customers can reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future andor develop their own competitive services in particular the payments industry is currently undergoing significant consolidations and the merger of one or more of our customers with financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects   our business strategy calls for us to grow our business by among other things entering into customized agreements with customers around the globe like our other customer relationships these agreements are terminable by our customers in a variety of circumstances examples of provisions appearing in various agreements currently in effect that may permit a customer to terminate its agreement include    a number of our key customers are represented on our board of directors if any one of these customers were to lose its representation on the board this could have a detrimental effect on our business relationship with that customer conversely a number of customers that we earn substantial revenues from are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of revenues or transaction volumes from these customers could have an adverse impact on our business   in addition we may be required to permit issuers with which we have entered into business agreements in the united states to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the antitrust litigation currently on appeal that was brought against us by the doj which is described in a separate risk factor above accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us 17   we do not issue cards set cardholder fees or determine the interest rates if applicable charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each mastercard issuer is responsible for determining these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not solicit merchants to process transactions or establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which are responsibilities of our acquirers as a result much of our business depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our customers in turn our customers’ success is dependent upon a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below   we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands and programs although it is our business strategy to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry   the global payments industry is highly competitive some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have we may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these and the other threats discussed under the heading “competition” as a result our revenues or income may decline   over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat for mastercard because our business strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard accordingly the merger of one or more of our significant customers with financial institutions that have strong relationships with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in particular in the first quarter of 2004 jp morgan chase the parent of one of our largest principal members and stockholders announced its intention to acquire bank one a financial institution principally aligned with visa the loss of a material portion of our current business with chase as a result of this transaction could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and business prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects   in the united states we believe that mastercardbranded transactions account for a smaller share of all offline signaturebased debit transactions than they do credit or charge transactions in addition many of our competitors process a greater number of online pinbased debit transactions at the point of sale than we do since our maestro brand has relatively low market penetration in the united states in recent years we believe that offline and online debit has grown more rapidly than credit or charge transactions if we are unable to maintain and grow our debit business in the united states the reputation of our brands and overall business may suffer in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signaturebased debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by atmdebit pointofsale networks as opposed to us as a secondary obligor of certain obligations of principal members and affiliate debit licensees we are exposed to risk of loss in the event that any of our members default on their mastercard cirrus or maestro settlement obligations   mastercard settlement exposure materializes when an issuer or acquirer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical reasons liquidity shortfall insolvency or other reasons we quantify each member’s settlement credit risk exposure by estimating the dollar value of issuing and chargeback transactions that we would have to fund in order to satisfy such member’s mastercard maestro or cirrusrelated obligations to other members if a principal or affiliate member is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to 18 other members we may bear the loss even if we do not process the transaction in addition although we are not contractually obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole in the event that an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations in order to maintain the integrity and acceptance of our brands accordingly one or more member defaults could expose us to significant losses and reduce our net income for more information on our settlement exposure see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

  the continuation of negative economic conditions in 2003 caused significant increases in consumer bankruptcies which led to increased writeoffs of consumer credit card loans by some of our members these conditions caused the credit quality of certain of our members to deteriorate during 2003 we generally responded to these instances of member credit quality deterioration by increasing the level of collateral held from members any decrease in the credit quality of a member increases the risk of member default and can cause a member to reduce the scope of its programs with mastercard or voluntarily terminate its mastercard memberships andor license which could have a negative impact on our revenues and net income global economic political and other conditions may adversely affect our revenues   the global payments industry is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands in addition a significant portion of the volume generated on cards carrying our brands is associated with crossborder business and leisure travel which may be adversely affected by world geopolitical and other conditions if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of mastercardbranded cards could decline which would reduce our revenues and income   the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes such as continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and to provide endtoend payment solutions for our customers if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions securely efficiently or at all our revenues or income would be materially reduced   our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access terrorism or accident most of our transaction processing systems are operated out of a single facility supported by a separate backup facility a natural disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers such as att for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services and adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and our revenues or income   in addition our security protection measures including with respect to the security of transaction information processed on our systems or the systems or processing technology of third parties participating in our network may not be sufficient to prevent the fraudulent or other improper use of cards carrying our brands unauthorized use of our network potentially could jeopardize the security of confidential information 19 stored in our computer systems or transmitted by our customers or others these factors may result in liabilities for us or our customers and could reduce our revenues and income 

the growth of mastercard advisors and purchase street research may produce risks for our business   we are making significant investments in the development of our consulting business mastercard advisors and our research business purchase street research at this time neither of these businesses make a significant contribution to our revenues and because these businesses are still in their early stages their ability to generate future revenue and to achieve profitability is uncertain the continued development of these businesses will require significant cash and time investments and could have an adverse impact on our overall profitability result in the assumption of material additional liabilities make financial and operational consistency more difficult to maintain and create other risks under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business because we have significant international operations we face additional risks related to political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate our business   we operate in and intend to expand our business further in countries throughout the world we cannot be sure that we will be able to broaden our global operations in a costeffective manner or compete effectively in all of our targeted countries there are risks inherent in conducting business internationally any of which could adversely affect our operations including    if these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot assure you that we will continue to develop and implement effective policies and strategies in each location where we do business adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenues we receive from our international operations   during 2003 approximately 37 of our revenues were generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenues we generate outside the united states are subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of international currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our revenue currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 








 item 2 properties   as of december 31 2003 mastercard and its subsidiaries owned or leased 58 properties we own our corporate headquarters a threestory 472600 square foot building located in purchase new york there is no outstanding debt on this building our principal technology and operations center is a 528000 square foot leased facility located in o’fallon missouri known as “winghaven” the term of the lease on this facility is 10 years which commenced on august 31 1999 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 20 included herein our leased properties in the united states are located in 9 states and in the district of columbia we also lease properties in 36 other countries these facilities primarily consist of corporate and regional offices as well as our operations centers

 item 3 legal proceedings   refer to notes 3 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein settlement of us merchant lawsuit   in addition as summarized in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included herein commencing in october 1996 several class action suits were brought by a number of us merchants — including walmart stores inc sears roebuck  co inc the limited inc and safeway inc — against mastercard international and visa usa inc “visa” challenging certain aspects of the payment card industry under us federal antitrust law those suits were later consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of new york the plaintiffs challenged mastercard’s “honor all cards” rule and a similar visa rule which requires merchants who accept mastercard cards to accept for payment every validly presented mastercard card plaintiffs claimed that mastercard and visa unlawfully tied acceptance of debit cards to acceptance of credit cards in essence the merchants desired the ability to reject offline signaturebased debit transactions for example mastercard card transactions in favor of other payment forms including online pinbased debit transactions for example maestro or regional atm network transactions which generally impose lower transaction costs for merchants the plaintiffs also claimed that mastercard and visa conspired to monopolize what they characterized as the pointofsale debit card market thereby suppressing the growth of regional networks such as atm payment systems plaintiffs alleged that the plaintiff class had been forced to pay unlawfully high prices for debit and credit card transactions as a result of the alleged tying arrangement and monopolization practices   on april 30 2003 in lieu of proceeding with trial mastercard international signed a memorandum of understanding “mou” with plaintiffs establishing an agreement in principle subject to execution of a settlement agreement and approval by the district court to settle all claims resulting from the litigation in return for certain payments and injunctive relief on june 4 2003 mastercard and plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement the “settlement agreement” that embodies the terms originally set forth in the mou the settlement agreement required mastercard to pay 125000000 in 2003 and requires us to pay 100000000 annually from 2004 through 2012 also mastercard was required to adopt rules by january 1 2004 which permit us merchants to elect not to accept mastercardbranded debit or credit cards implement programs to allow merchants to identify debit cards and provide signage to merchants in addition the settlement agreement required mastercard to lower the effective debit interchange rate by 33 during the period from august 1 2003 to december 31 2003 the settlement agreement also contains certain provisions relating to the administration of the settlement subject to the orders of the district court in addition the settlement agreement provides that members of the plaintiff class in existence on june 21 2002 who did not opt out of the class pursuant to the order of the district court of that date will not be provided with another opportunity to opt out of the class   mastercard denies all claims in this litigation and nothing in the mou or the settlement agreement constitutes an admission of wrongdoing or liability by mastercard for the full text of the settlement agreement see exhibit 101 to the quarterly report on form 10q of mastercard for the quarter ending june 30 2003 for a narrative description of the terms of the settlement agreement see paragraphs 5 and 6 of part ii item 1 of the quarterly report on form 10q of mastercard for the quarter ending june 30 2003 incorporated by reference herein 21   on december 19 2003 the court issued an order and decision granting final approval to the settlement and allocation plan on january 23 2004 the court entered its final judgment in this matter several members of the plaintiff class have appealed the court’s approval of the final judgment   on september 19 2003 the global board of directors of mastercard international determined that it would not impose a special assessment on members in order to satisfy the financial obligations in the settlement agreement 


 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders   no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2003

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters   there is currently no established public trading market for the common stock of mastercard incorporated there were approximately 1275 holders of record of the common stock of mastercard incorporated as of february 11 2004 we do not pay any cash dividends on our common stock and intend to retain future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business accordingly we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future payment of future dividends if any would be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results and current and anticipated cash needs the common stock of mastercard incorporated is not currently authorized to be issued in connection with any compensation plan   during the period covered by this report mastercard incorporated did not make any sales of its equity securities that were not registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended 


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” and mastercard europe sprl “mastercard europe”together “mastercard” or the “company” included elsewhere in this report forwardlooking statements   this report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report the words “believe” “expect” “could” “may” “will” and similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements these statements relate to our future prospects developments and business strategies many factors and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control influence whether any forwardlooking statements can or will be achieved any one of those factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in writing in any forwardlooking statements made by mastercard or on its behalf we believe there are certain risk factors 24 that are important to our business and that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations please see a complete discussion of these risk factors under the caption “risk factors” in item 1 — business of the form 10k 

overview   our revenues continued to grow in spite of the weakened economy in the first half of 2003 coupled with decreased travel as a result of sars and the conflict in the middle east in certain markets we are seeing positive results from the expansion of our advertising and marketing support initiatives the primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition promote brand acceptance and enhance the development of our programs and services in 2003 revenues increased by 18 of which 9 was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe and 2 was due to the weakening of the dollar against the euro creating a favorable currency translation our operating expenses grew by 62 in 2003 of which 44 was due to the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 10 was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe and 1 was due to the weakening of the dollar against the euro creating an unfavorable currency translation   the global payments industry is highly competitive we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services most of our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of our customers currently the payments industry is undergoing significant consolidations and the merger of one or more of our customers with financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues   our financial results have been significantly influenced by the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate our business during the current year we settled the us merchant lawsuit and contract disputes with certain customers resulting in a pretax charge of 763 million we decided not to assess our members for these settlements and plan on funding the settlement costs from operations as payments are due due to the nature of our business we believe the legal and regulatory environment will remain a challenge in the coming year and we expect to devote a considerable amount of time and resources to addressing it 

 

   we earn a portion of our revenues in connection with mastercardbranded offline debit cards in the united states following the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included herein visa usa inc implemented a bylaw requiring visa’s 100 largest issuers of debit cards in the united states to pay a fee if they reduce their debit volume by more than 10 if visa is permitted to enforce this bylaw it would penalize visa members seeking to do debit business with mastercard and effectively prevent them from converting their debit cards to the mastercard brand mastercard has challenged the validity of this bylaw provision as described more fully in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in addition under the settlement agreement in the us merchant lawsuit merchants will have the right to reject mastercardbranded debit cards in the united states while still accepting other mastercardbranded cards and vice versa either of these scenarios would be detrimental to mastercard’s ability to maintain and grow its debit card business in the united states   we establish multilateral interchange fees on behalf of certain customers while we do not receive or record interchange fees as revenue the impact of the global interchange proceedings described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein could impact our customers’ use of card programs carrying our brands thereby negatively impacting our future revenues results of operations   key selected financial and operating data for the three years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is included in the table below the acquisition of mastercard europe formerly europay international sa “epi” on june 28 2002 affected the comparability of our financial data the results of mastercard europe’s operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations from june 28 2002 however mastercard europe’s gross dollar volume and transactions are included in all periods 25     our functional currency is the us dollar except for mastercard europe whose functional currency is the euro therefore our results of operations have been impacted by movements of the euro against the us dollar as the euro strengthened against the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2003 mastercard europe’s revenue and expenses increased as a result of translation into us dollar amounts in addition we assess our members based on the us dollar volume of their card programs since the us dollar devalued against most major currencies in 2003 our revenues increased accordingly however it is not practical to estimate the impact of the us dollar devaluation on our assessment revenue revenues   our revenues are generated from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services and from assessments calculated on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands we establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer transactions on a global basis we do not issue cards set fees or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on mastercardbranded cards our issuing customers have the responsibility for determining these and most other competitive card features our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information historical and projected customer performance   the us market remains our largest geographic market revenue generated in the us accounted for approximately 63 and 61 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively no other country accounted for more than 5 of the company’s revenue in 2003 and 2002 26 

 

   operations fees primarily represent user fees for authorization clearing settlement and other payment services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis operations fees increased 199 million or 16 in 2003 and 149 million or 14 in 2002 from the prior year the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 111 million or 56 and 69 million or 46 of the increase in operations fees in 2003 and 2002 respectively the significant changes in operations fees were as follows   27    our pricing structure rewards customers with lower prices in exchange for certain volume share and other commitments core revenue growth rates are affected by the consolidation of our customers competition in our industry and continued organic growth in transactions and volumes since we offer tiered pricing for our services as our customers merge and grow they are moving into lower relative pricing for the same level of services in addition to the tiered pricing incentives and rebates are provided to certain customers incentives and rebates increased 9 million in 2003 and 13 million in 2002 

 

   assessments are based on our customers’ gross dollar volume “gdv” of mastercard transactions gdv represents gross usage purchase and cash disbursements on mastercardbranded cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks in 2003 and 2002 assessment revenue growth was 140 million or 21 and 132 million or 25 respectively the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 94 million or 68 and 75 million or 57 of the increase in assessments in 2003 and 2002 respectively excluding mastercard europe assessment revenues grew 8 in 2003 and 11 in 2002   gdv growth including mastercard europe when measured in local currency was 6 and 16 in 2003 and 2002 respectively and 10 and 17 respectively when measured on a us dollar converted basis moderating the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers which increased by 72 million and 53 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively these rebates and incentives generally are based on card generated volume as well as a fixed component for marketing support for the launch of new programs as volumes increase the rebates and incentives also increase additionally the increase in rebates in 2003 can be attributed to the addition of new member contracts particularly in mastercard europe which adopted the practice of offering rebates and incentives after the integration operating expenses   our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses in 2003 there was an increase in operating expenses of 11 billion or 62 of which 763 million or 44 was a result of the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and 197 million or 11 was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe in 2002 there was an increase in operating expenses of 360 million or 26 of which 169 million or 12 was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe 28 

 

   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel professional fees data processing telecommunications and travel in 2003 and 2002 these activities accounted for approximately 39 and 55 of operating expenses respectively general and administrative expenses increased 134 million in 2003 and 151 million in 2002 primarily due to increases in personnel expenses the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 110 million or 82 and 78 million or 52 of the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2003 and 2002 respectively    

 

   advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising and marketing and promotions and sponsorships which promote our brand and assist our customers in achieving their goals in 2003 and 2002 these activities accounted for approximately 30 and 40 of operating expenses respectively advertising and market development expenses increased 157 million or 23 in 2003 and 188 million or 37 in 2002 the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 70 million or 45 and 73 million or 39 of the increase in advertising and market development expenses in 2003 and 2002 respectively   our advertising and market development expenses increased as a result of a number of key initiatives in 2003 and 2002 the major advertising and market development activities increased as follows  29   the mastercard family of brands principally mastercard maestro and cirrus are valuable strategic assets which convey a symbol that can be readily identified by our customers as well as our customers’ customers which create value for our business our advertising and marketing efforts are focused on ensuring that our services are identified communicated and marketed in a clear efficient and consistent manner not only on a local level but also on a global scale we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brand reputation and image   in 2002 mastercard implemented a fouryear plan to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard and its customers by significantly expanding its spending in advertising and market development for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we spent 152 million and 87 million respectively on advertising and marketing relating to this plan the primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition promote brand acceptance and enhance the development of our programs and services in certain markets we will continue to evaluate the extent of these initiatives in light of changing market conditions 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 the total pretax charge recorded for the us merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements was 763 million the primary components of this charge were i the monetary amount of the us merchant settlement discounted at 8 percent over the payment term ii certain additional costs in connection with and in order to comply with other requirements of the us merchant settlement and iii costs to address certain merchants who opted not to participate in the us merchant lawsuit in addition in 2003 mastercard settled contract disputes with certain customers and incurred additional costs in connection with the conclusion of certain litigation discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein certain of these amounts are estimates the company will evaluate these estimates if circumstances change and if necessary make refinements 

 

   depreciation and amortization expenses increased 29 million in 2003 and 21 million in 2002 depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly between the periods due to the acquisition of mastercard europe as well as additional capitalized computer software the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 17 million or 59 and 18 million or 86 of the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2003 and 2002 respectively our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions this technology is continuously updated and improved therefore our investment in capitalized software and related amortization also continues to increase in recent years we have made the following significant changes to our technology and technology centers which have caused an increase in our depreciation and amortization  

 

   other income expense is comprised primarily of investment income and interest expense investment income increased 31 million in 2003 and 3 million in 2002 the increase in 2003 is primarily due to the consolidation of the variable interest entity see the discussion in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included herein and appreciation of the market value of our trading securities portfolio interest expense increased 53 million in 2003 primarily due to 43 million of imputed interest on the us merchant lawsuit settlement obligation and the consolidation of the variable interest entity interest expense was 10 million in 2002 and 2001 30 

 

   the effective income tax benefit rate for the year ended december 31 2003 was 361 versus an effective income tax rate of 265 for the year ended december 31 2002 the 2003 tax benefit is primarily driven by the merchant lawsuit settlement the 2002 rate was primarily attributable to a onetime revaluation of the 2002 mastercard europe deferred tax liabilities due to the reduction in the belgium statutory tax rate from 402 to 340 in december 2002   the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased to 265 from 390 for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to several items some of which are not expected to recur in december 2002 the belgium statutory tax rate was reduced from 402 to 340 as a result deferred income tax liabilities established in connection with the acquisition of mastercard europe were reduced based on the lower belgian income tax rate the effective tax rate was also decreased by a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income in the united states from jurisdictions with higher state tax rates to those with lower rates furthermore we realized significant foreign tax credits that we were previously unable to claim the benefits of these items in lowering the effective tax rate were partially offset by a onetime increase in state income tax expense attributable to lower deferred state tax assets as a result of lower state tax rates 

 

   effective january 1 2003 the company changed its method of calculating the marketrelated value of plan assets used in determining the expected returnonasset component of its annual pension cost under the previous method 80 percent of the gains and losses on plan assets were deferred and recognized in the calculated marketrelated value over the following four years under the new method the marketrelated value equals the current fair value of the plan assets the new method is considered preferable because annual pension expense will reflect changes in the market performance of plan assets on a more timely basis   on january 1 2003 the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” and consolidated a variable interest entity on its consolidated balance sheet the consolidation resulted in recording a heldtomaturity municipal bond longterm debt and minority interest liquidity   we believe our ability to generate cash from our business to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths we need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development to provide for settlement risk to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the us merchant lawsuit at december 31 2003 we had 880 million of liquid investments with which to manage operations compared to 841 million at december 31 2002 we expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital needs in 2004 in addition we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard in 2004 31     cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was generated principally by current period earnings exclusive of noncash charges for depreciation and amortization and legal settlements we recorded expense of 763 million for legal settlement costs in 2003 of which related cash payments totaled 134 million in 2002 cash provided by operating activities was principally due to changes in settlement due to and from members and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as a result of higher advertising spending and our focus on working capital management   the utilization of cash by investing activities in 2003 was primarily due to the purchase of property plant equipment and capitalized software the primary capital expenditure was the purchase of a building in kansas city missouri for a coprocessing center see discussion in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included herein our capitalized software is essential to providing payment card transaction processing to our members through a proprietary global computer and telecommunications system in 2002 our outlay of cash was primarily due to purchases of data center equipment capitalized software and investment securities availableforsale offset by 31 million of cash received net of acquisitionrelated expenses from the acquisition of mastercard europe during the second quarter of 2002   in 2002 financing activities relate to repayments of mastercard’s net settlement overdraft positions see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included herein   as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included herein we recorded liabilities in connection with certain legal settlements we believe that we will be able to fund amounts payable in connection with these legal settlements through existing cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity   due to standard  poor’s assessment of mastercard’s vulnerability to legal risk on may 16 2003 standard  poor’s lowered mastercard’s counterparty credit rating to a a2 subordinated debt rating to bbb and placed mastercard on negative outlook we do not believe this rating action will materially impact our liquidity   in addition to our liquid investments we provide for liquidity through a committed 12 billion revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with certain financial institutions which expires on june 18 2004 the primary purpose of the credit facility is to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by mastercard members interest on borrowings under the credit facility is charged at the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 28 basis points an additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate borrowings exceed 33 of the commitments mastercard agreed to pay a facility fee equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment mastercard was in compliance with the credit facility covenants as of december 31 32 2003 there were no borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2003 the lenders under the credit facility are members or affiliates of members of mastercard international 

future obligations   the following table summarizes as of december 31 2003 our obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances  

 

 member relationships and related parties   we have a diversified member base of 2600 principal members and 22300 affiliate members our stockholders are all principal members of mastercard international in the normal course of business we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of mastercard international these members do not constitute related parties pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 57 “related party disclosures”   certain of our members generate in excess of five percent of our revenue the loss of any of these members could adversely impact mastercard’s net income in addition as part of our business initiative to increase our share mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with members these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances under certain circumstances we may be required to permit members in the united states that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those 33 agreements without penalty as a result of the current antitrust litigation being brought against us by the us department of justice any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition however we believe that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

critical accounting policies   our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 

 

   the company’s revenue is comprised principally of operations fees and assessments generally revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or selfreported by our customers certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information historical and projected customer performance   we have business agreements with certain customers that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet certain hurdles such rebates are generally calculated on a monthly basis based upon the estimated customers’ performance and the contracted discount rates for the services provided and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned   in addition we enter into agreements with certain customers to provide volumebased and support incentives that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” incentives are based on management’s estimate of the customer’s performance in a given period   our estimate of customers’ performance is a critical component in the calculation of rebates and incentives rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimates of customer performance and the terms in the related customer agreements customers’ performance is estimated by using historical performance member reported information discussions with our customers and transactional information accumulated from our systems actual results may differ from these estimates 

 

   we are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters except as described in notes 3 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements included herein mastercard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “sfas no 5” our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel   we accrued legal costs that are expected to be incurred to defend mastercard relating to certain litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 the accrual was estimated based upon management’s expectations of foreseeable costs as determined in consultation with outside counsel changes in the estimated amount of accrued legal costs can significantly impact our results of operations   due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may not reflect the actual outcomes 34 

 

   we estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the settlement agreement to be 8 the discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement which considered our expected postsettlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms   a 1 increase in the discount rate would decrease the amount we recorded as an aftertax charge for the year ended december 31 2003 by approximately 20 million and increase annual interest expense by approximately 42 million 40 million and 38 million in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively and declining amounts thereafter the reverse impact would be experienced for a 1 decrease in the discount rate 

 

   goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses in accordance with sfas 142 on january 1 2002 we stopped amortizing goodwill prior to january 1 2002 goodwill was amortized under the straightline method over the related useful life of 20 years   principally all of our goodwill relates to the integration of mastercard europe on an annual basis we will evaluate whether an impairment of the goodwill may exist goodwill is tested for impairment using a twostep approach the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss if any impairment is measured as the excess of carrying amount over fair value   in conducting our impairment analyses we utilized independent valuation experts to perform the analyses and tests of our goodwill the test methods employed involved assumptions concerning interest and discount rates growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions the assumptions employed were based on management’s judgment using internal and external data based on our testing we concluded that goodwill was not impaired 

 

   other intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs franchise rights trademarks tradenames and other intangible assets which have finite lives and customer relationships which have indefinite lives intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives under the straightline method   sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” requires intangible assets with finite lives to be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable the primary component of our definite lived assets is our capitalized software our capitalized software which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use is included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with statement of position 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” and related guidance development costs are expensed during the preliminary project management phase until it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended thereafter all qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the design development and testing phase are capitalized and upon the project being substantially complete and ready for its intended use are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software not to exceed three years costs related to postimplementation activities for software that is developed or obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred   we are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use and the phase of each project in addition we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design development and testing phases of the project these judgments and estimates impact the accounting for capitalized software in our consolidated financial statements during the year we discontinued the use of various technologies and as such we performed an impairment analysis on the related technologies and 35 concluded that the carrying value of these assets was in excess of fair value fair value was estimated as zero due to discontinued future use and an impairment charge was recorded 

  sfas 142 also requires intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested for impairment at least annually we consider our customer relationships to be an indefinite lived intangible asset and as such test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment we utilized independent valuation experts to assist us in determining the fair value of our customer relationships during 2003 based on our testing we concluded that our customer relationships were not impaired 

 

   certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual pension costs and the disclosure of the funded position of our pension plans key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure the plans’ projected benefit obligation and the expected rate of return on plan assets we utilized a discount rate of 625 percent in measuring the pension projected benefit obligation at december 31 2003 675 percent in calculating the 2003 expense and an expected return on plan assets of 85 percent a quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation by 2 million and would increase our annual pension expense by 03 million an equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate a quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by 03 million recent accounting pronouncements   in november 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” “eitf 0021” eitf 0021 addresses how to determine when a revenue arrangement for multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and if separation is appropriate how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units the provisions of eitf 0021 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 the company may enter into contracts with its customers that provide for free or discounted services that are required to be separately identified under eitf 0021 the discount from the fair value of the services is recorded as a reduction of revenue related to other elements of the contract the company adopted eitf 0021 on july 1 2003 and the impact of adopting this accounting pronouncement was negligible   in january 2003 fin 46 was issued and in december 2003 fin 46 was revised fin 46 clarifies that companies may need to consolidate certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after january 31 2003 the company adopted fin 46 on january 1 2003 the impact of consolidating the variable interest entity is discussed in detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included herein the revised provisions of fin 46 will be effective in the first quarter of 2004 our adoption of the revisions to fin 46 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   in december 2003 the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab 104” which supercedes sab no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” “sab 101” the primary purpose of sab 104 is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf 0021 additionally sab 104 rescinds the sec’s “revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers” “the faq” issued with sab 101 that had been codified in sec topic 13 “revenue recognition” selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab 104 the adoption of sab 104 did not have an impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations   in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 revised 2003 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 and 106 and a 36 revision of fasb statement no 132” “fas 132” this statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by fasb statements no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” no 88 “employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” and no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” sfas 132 requires additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the company has adopted those aspects of sfas 132 which are required for fiscal year ended 2003 and will fully implement the revised standard in fiscal year ending 2004 

  in january 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 106 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” “fsp 1061” fsp 1061 permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a onetime election to defer accounting for any effects of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” without fsp 1061 plan sponsors would be required under sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” to account for the effects of the act in the fiscal period that includes december 8 2003 the date the president of the united states signed the act into law if deferral is elected the deferral must remain in effect until the earlier of a the issuance of guidance by the fasb on how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan sponsors under the act or b the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations subsequent to january 31 2004 mastercard made the onetime election to defer accounting for any effects of the act until guidance is issued by fasb and will determine the impact if any that the act will have on the financial position and results of operations of the company   in november 2003 the eitf reached a partial consensus on eitf issue no 0301 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” “eitf 0301” eitf 0301 addresses determining the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either availableforsale or heldtomaturity under sfas 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” “sfas 115” and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method although the eitf requested further revisions to the underlying impairment models the eitf reached a consensus that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be required for debt and marketable equity securities classified as availableforsale or heldtomaturity under sfas 115 that are below cost at the balance sheet date but for which an otherthantemporary impairment has not been recognized the consensus on quantitative and qualitative disclosures is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 the company adopted the disclosure provisions of eitf 0301 for fiscal year ended 2003 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies which have been approved by the board of directors governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments we monitor aggregate risk exposures on an ongoing basis there have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at december 31 2003 as compared to december 31 2002 foreign exchange risk   we enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies we also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the us dollar and euro the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months 37   at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 forward currency contracts against the us dollar were both purchased with notional amounts of 64 million and 39 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 60 million and 25 million respectively based on the yearend 2003 and 2002 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at 04 million and 13 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively   at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 forward currency contracts against the euro were both purchased with notional amounts of 178 million and 199 million respectively and sold with notional amounts of 8 million at december 31 2002 there were no forward currency contracts sold against the euro at december 31 2003 based on the yearend 2003 and 2002 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at 16 million and 17 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively   our settlement activities may be subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to usd or one of seventeen other stable transaction currencies the remaining 144 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure interest rate risk   our interest sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as availableforsale investments they are rated aa or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and mediumterm notes with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure based on the net present value of expected future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in interest rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of 17 million and 15 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively our heldtomaturity investments are considered nontrading securities and would not be subject to interest rate movements   our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities a 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of 12 million and 13 million for december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included herein   at december 31 2003 and 2002 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement there were no amounts outstanding at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively under these credit facilities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included herein equity price risk   we own trading securities which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of 3 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 since these securities are part of a deferred executive compensation plan and to the extent the plan remains in a net appreciation position an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense 38

   revenue was 1892 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1611 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 281 million or 17 of which 143 million or 9 was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe our revenue is comprised of operations fees and assessments on january 1 2002 we implemented emerging issues task force issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” “eitf 019” and reclassified as a reduction of revenue certain payments to customers and merchants that were previously recognized as advertising and market development expense we anticipate that future revenue growth will be moderated by additional investments in our business   operations fees represent user fees for authorization clearing settlement and other products and services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis operations fees are generally driven by transactions the number of transactions processed increased to approximately 8943 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to approximately 7765 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of approximately 15 the preceding figure reflects certain revisions to the previously reported number of transactions processed using the revised information processed transactions for the three and nine months ended september 30 2002 were 2339 billion and 6479 billion respectively during the yearended december 31 2002 mastercard brandedtransactions including transactions not processed by the company increased to approximately 13577 billion from approximately 11731 billion in the prior year an increase of approximately 16 mastercard europe transactions are included in both 26 periods operations fees were 1231 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1083 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 149 million or 14 approximately 69 million of operations fees in 2002 were due to the acquisition of mastercard europe increases in operations fees were partially offset by a 9 million decline in warning bulletin revenue in the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 exclusive of mastercard europe’s warning bulletin revenue operations fees were also offset by lower average pricing based on the company’s pricing structure which rewards customers with lower prices for incremental volume and a 13 million increase in rebates provided to customers in the year ended december 31 2002 over the same period in 2001 

  assessments predominantly represent payments made by members of mastercard international in respect of their card programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within the mastercard family of brands principally the mastercard maestro and cirrus brands assessments were approximately 660 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 528 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of approximately 132 million or 25 approximately 75 million of our assessments in 2002 were due to our acquisition of mastercard europe in addition the increase in assessments was attributable to an increase in gross dollar volume “gdv” between the periods gdv represents gross usage purchase and cash disbursements on mastercard cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks gdv growth in 2002 as compared to 2001 was approximately 15 when measured in local currency and approximately 16 when measured on a us dollar converted basis gdv was 1142 trillion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 986 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 gdv includes mastercard europe activity in both periods presented offsetting the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers which increased by 53 million in the year ended december 31 2002 over the same period in 2001 a significant portion of the increase was related to the acquisition of mastercard europe   operating expenses were 1750 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1390 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 360 million or 26 our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development depreciation and amortization expenses operating expenses increased 169 million due to our acquisition of mastercard europe we expect to continue to invest significantly primarily in advertising and marketing support over the next several years to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard and its customers the primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition promote brand acceptance and to enhance the development of our programs and services there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful we expect operating expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as a result of these initiatives   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel telecommunications data processing travel and professional fees general and administrative expenses were 965 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 814 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 151 million or 19 this increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs of 105 million resulting from increases in additional personnel including the impact of the acquisition of mastercard europe and salary increases in 2002 approximately 78 million of general and administrative expenses in 2002 were due to the acquisition of mastercard europe general and administrative expenses include net foreign exchange losses of 2 million and 7 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively these net foreign exchange losses primarily result from forward contracts   for the year ended december 31 2002 we made significant investments in advertising and market development to build value in our brands and to develop programs to differentiate ourselves from our competition advertising and market development expenses were 694 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 506 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 188 million or 37 primarily consisting of a 91 million increase in advertising expense a 74 million increase in promotions and sponsorships expense and a 23 million increase in marketing expense approximately 73 million of advertising and market development expenses in 2002 were due to the acquisition of mastercard europe   our increased advertising and market development expenses were related to a number of key initiatives in 2002 mastercard was a sponsor of the 2002 fifa world cup which required a significant amount of resources in 2002 for the sponsorship fee special programming promotions and event marketing other 27 significant sponsorships during 2002 included major league baseball and the professional golf association mastercard also incurred increased advertising spending for special programming associated with the grammy and academy awards in 2002 we significantly increased our investment in advertising and market support to increase brand recognition and promote brand acceptance we plan to accelerate and increase the investment in advertising as well as other programs and sponsorships in 2003 and for several years thereafter 

  depreciation expense was 40 million in each of the years ended december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 during 2001 certain assets were written off due to the move to our winghaven technology center see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included herein accordingly the company’s depreciation expense decreased in 2002 this decrease in depreciation was offset by approximately 7 million of depreciation expense that was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe   amortization expense was 51 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 20 million this increase was primarily driven by 11 million of amortization expense due to the acquisition of mastercard europe as well as additional amortization of capitalized computer software   other income expense was 16 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 11 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 5 million other income expense comprises primarily interest dividend and other investment income related to the portfolio of investments held as well as interest expense minority interest and other expense the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 2 million of the increase in other income and expense   the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased to 265 from 390  for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to several items some of which are not expected to recur in december 2002 the belgium statutory tax rate was reduced from 402 to 340 as a result deferred income tax liabilities established in connection with the acquisition of mastercard europe were reduced based on the lower belgian income tax rate in addition we anticipate settling certain tax examinations on a favorable basis the effective tax rate was also decreased by a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income in the united states from jurisdictions with higher state tax rates to those with lower rates furthermore we realized significant foreign tax credits that we were previously unable to claim the benefits of these items in lowering the effective tax rate were partially offset by a onetime increase in state income tax expense attributable to lower deferred state tax assets as a result of lower state tax rates   as a result of the foregoing our net income was 116 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 142 million for the year ended december 31 2001 a decrease of 26 million or 18 the net loss of 7 million resulting from the acquisition of mastercard europe contributed to the decrease in net income for the year ended december 31 2002 the initiatives discussed above which involve significant expenditures to support and build value in the mastercard family of brands could result in lower net income or slower net income growth over the next several years 

 

   revenue was 1611 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 1445 billion for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 166 million or 12 our revenue is comprised of operations fees and assessments   operations fees represent user fees for authorization clearing settlement and other products and services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis operations fees were 1083 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 970 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 113 million or 12 this increase was primarily attributable to the number of transactions processed by mastercard operations fees were offset by lower average pricing based on the company’s pricing structure which rewards customers with lower prices for incremental volume and a 27 million increase in rebates provided to customers in the year ended december 31 2001 over the same period in 2000 during the same period mastercard brandedtransactions including transactions not processed by the company increased to approximately 11731 billion from approximately 9994 billion an increase of approximately 17 28   assessments predominantly represent payments made by members of mastercard international in respect of their card programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within the mastercard family of brands principally mastercard maestro and cirrus brands assessments were 528 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 475 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 53 million or 11 the increase in assessments was attributable primarily to an increase in gdv between the periods gdv represents gross usage purchase and cash disbursements on mastercard cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks gdv growth in 2001 as compared to 2000 was approximately 18 when measured in local currency and approximately 14 when measured on a us dollar converted basis offsetting the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers which increased 54 million in the year ended december 31 2001 over the same period in 2000   while the events of september 11 2001 did not have a significant impact on mastercard’s total volume they did impact the mix between domestic and international volumes experienced by mastercard international volume decreased dramatically in the weeks following september 11th due to decreased international travel and related expenditures however this decrease was partially offset by higher domestic volume toward the end of the year volumes began to recover which helped drive the overall increase in revenue over the prior year   operating expenses were 1390 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 1267 billion for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 122 million or 10 our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development depreciation and amortization expenses   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel telecommunications data processing travel and professional fees general and administrative expenses were 814 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 737 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 77 million or 10 this increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs resulting from increases in additional personnel and compensation   for the year ended december 31 2001 mastercard made significant investments in advertising and market development to support and build value in the mastercard family of brands and to develop new and distinct programs to differentiate ourselves from our competition advertising and market development expenses were 506 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 471 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 35 million or 7 our promotions and sponsorship fees increased between the periods primarily as a result of incremental promotions in the year ended december 31 2001 such as the national hockey league celebrity cup faceoff as well as increased contractual sponsorship fees associated with the fifa world cup copa america national hockey league major league baseball and pga golf organizations these increases were partially offset by reductions in media expenditures between the periods in traditional television venues and the internet   depreciation expense was 40 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 35 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 5 million or 14 primarily due to purchases of equipment in 2001   amortization expense was 30 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 25 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of approximately 6 million or 23 this increase was primarily the result of additional amortization of capitalized computer software partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of franchise rights in 2001 due to the writedown of mondex franchise rights in certain asian countries to their estimated fair value in 2000   other income expense was 11 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2000 a decrease of 11 million or 49 other income expense comprises primarily interest dividend and other investment income related to the portfolio of investments held as well as interest expense minority interest and other expense the decrease in other income expense was primarily the result of a devaluation of the trading securities portfolio 29   the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2001 decreased to 390 from 410 for the year ended december 31 2000 the lower rate for the year ended december 31 2001 was primarily due to the utilization for income tax purposes of a loss related to foreign operations the apportionment of pretax income to states with a lower tax rate and a larger amount of taxexempt interest income as a percentage of pretax income than in the year ended december 31 2000   as a result of the foregoing our net income was 142 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 118 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 24 million or 20 liquidity and capital resources   we need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development to cover any settlement risk to finance our capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and other contractual commitments at december 31 2002 we had 841 million of liquid investments with which to manage operations we expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital needs in 2003 in addition we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard in 2003   for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was 306 million compared to 196 million and 260 million for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december 31 2002 was principally due to changes in settlement due to and from members our accrued expenses and accounts payable increased for the year ended december 31 2002 due to increased spending for advertising and our focus on working capital management   net cash used in investing activities was 112 million 219 million and 322 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the outlay of cash in 2002 was primarily due to capital expenditures expenditures for capitalized software and purchases of investment securities availableforsale capital expenditures were predominantly associated with investments in data center equipment investment securities availableforsale increased as a result of investments made with excess funds those uses were offset by 31 million of cash received net of acquisitionrelated expenses from the acquisition of mastercard europe during the second quarter of 2002   net cash used in provided by financing activities for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 was 35 million 5 million and 6 million respectively in all years financing activities relate to repayments advances of mastercard’s net settlement overdraft positions see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included herein   our financial position continues to reflect strong liquidity working capital consisting of current assets less current liabilities was 526 million at december 31 2002 and 468 million at december 31 2001 representing a working capital ratio of 16 and 17 in 2002 and 2001 respectively   in addition to our liquid investments we provide for liquidity through a 364day revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with certain financial institutions that expires on june 3 2003 under the terms of the credit facility mastercard has commitments of 12 billion that can be borrowed in the form of revolving loans interest is charged at the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 28 basis points and the rate increases depending upon the amount of any draw down under the credit facility mastercard has agreed to pay a facility fee equal to 7 basis points per annum on each lender’s commitment see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 30   we have entered into contractual commitments associated with operating lease agreements for office space and equipment as well as for sponsorship licensing and other agreements obligations relating to these contractual commitments are estimated to be payable in the following periods    in the normal course of business mastercard operates systems for clearing and settling payment transactions among its members net settlements are generally cleared daily among members by wire transfer or other bank clearing means via settlement cash accounts however some transactions may not settle until subsequent business days due to varying local currency settlement value date intervals and other timing differences these timing differences result in amounts from members or amounts due to members for a duration normally ranging from one to four calendar days and are included in the balance sheet of mastercard as settlement due todue from members the net impact of the settled transactions was the main contributor to the net settlement cash account overdraft position of 10 million at december 31 2001 which was recorded in other current liabilities no overdraft positions existed at december 31 2002   primarily due to uncertainty surrounding lawsuits in particular the merchant antitrust litigation described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included herein on june 17 2002 standard  poor’s placed mastercard on negative outlook however standard  poor’s reaffirmed mastercard’s credit rating on september 4 2002   the adverse outcome of certain of the legal proceedings described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included herein could have a detrimental impact on liquidity and capital resources if they result in adverse awards of damages to the relevant plaintiffs   overall we believe our cash provided by operating activities our liquid investments and the credit facility provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing business requirements economic fluctuations   although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations we do not believe our operations have been significantly affected by inflation for the most part we have utilized technology and operating efficiencies to offset increased operating expenses in addition a portion of our revenues is based upon a percentage of gdv which partially insulates operating margins on these revenues from the effects of inflation   portions of our business can be seasonal revenue is generally favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period member relationships and related parties   we have a diversified member base of approximately 2300 principal members and approximately 23000 affiliate members our stockholders are all principal members of mastercard international in the normal course of business we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of mastercard international these members do not 31 constitute related parties pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 57 “related party disclosures” 

  certain of our members generate in excess of five percent of our revenue the loss of any of these members could adversely impact mastercard’s net income in addition as part of our business initiative to increase our share mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with members these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances under certain circumstances we may be required to permit members in the united states that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the current antitrust litigation being brought against us by the us department of justice any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition however we believe that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows critical accounting policies  estimates   our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgment 

 

   certain revenues are estimated based upon transactional information accumulated from our systems and using historical performance   we have business agreements with certain members that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet certain hurdles such rebates are generally calculated on a monthly basis based upon the estimated customer’s performance and the contracted discount rates for the services provided and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned   in addition we enter into agreements with certain customers to provide volumebased and support incentives that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” “eitf 019” incentives are based on management’s estimate of the customer’s performance in a given period   our estimate of customers’ performance is a critical component in the calculation of rebates and incentives customers’ performance is estimated by using historical performance discussions with our customers and transactional information accumulated from our systems the estimated performance is used to calculate the rebates and incentives based upon the related customer agreements actual results may differ from these estimates 

 

   our capitalized software which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use is capitalized in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with statement of position 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” and related guidance development costs are expensed during the preliminary project management phase until it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended thereafter all qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the 32 design development and testing phase are capitalized and upon the project being substantially complete and ready for its intended use are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software not to exceed three years costs related to postimplementation activities for software that is developed or obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred 

  we are required to make judgments to determine the feasibility of the project for its intended use and the phase of the projects in addition we estimate the internal costs based on hours spent on the design development and testing phases of the project these judgments and estimates impact the accounting for capitalized software in our financial statements 

 

   we test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” and test property plant and equipment for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we test equity investments for a loss in value which is other than temporary in accordance with accounting principles board no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” whenever indicators of impairment exist these assets are tested goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually   our test for impairment requires management to make assumptions regarding the expected net future cash flows of each asset these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts if the sum of expected net future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows or other methodologies   goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our balance sheet therefore an impairment could result in a material reduction of our assets as well as our net income

and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and supercedes fasb statement no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” sfas 144 also supersedes certain aspects of apb no 30 “reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently

from a vendor to a customer in connection with the customer’s purchase of the vendor’s products or to promote sales of the vendor’s products on january 1 2002 mastercard implemented eitf 019 which resulted in certain payments to customers and merchants previously classified as advertising and market development expense being reclassified as a reduction of revenue the amounts of such consideration were 167 million and 127 million for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively incentives are based on management’s estimate of the customer’s performance as detailed in the agreements in a given period and actual results may differ from these estimates   in june 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas 146” sfas 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes eitf issue no 943 “liability

with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan costs associated with exit or disposal activities for entities newly acquired in a business combination are not within the scope of sfas 146 the provisions of sfas 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 with early application encouraged the company early adopted sfas 146 on july 1 2002 the adoption of sfas 146 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations   in

the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december 15 2002 mastercard has complied with the disclosure requirements and is in

issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” fin 46 clarifies that companies may need to consolidate certain entities in which equity investors do not have the

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in both interest rates and foreign exchange rates management establishes and oversees the implementation of board of director approved policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments and we monitor aggregate risk exposures on an ongoing basis   we enter into forward currency contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies this activity minimizes our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the us dollar and euro as a result of the acquisition of mastercard europe mastercard’s market risk exposures at december 31 2002 are greater than december 31 2001   at december 31 2002 and 2001 forward currency contracts against the dollar were both sold with notional amounts of 25 million and 3 million respectively and purchased with notional amounts of 39 million and 11 million respectively based on the yearend 2002 and 2001 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at 13 million and 07 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively   in 2002 due to the acquisition of mastercard europe forward currency contracts against the euro were both sold with notional amounts of 8 million and purchased with notional amounts of 199 million a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at 17 million at december 31 2002 the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 12 months and are utilized to manage anticipated cash flows in major overseas markets for the subsequent year   our settlement activities may be subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rate for financial transactions and the clearing of settlement positions is typically one business day and is limited to seventeen stable transaction currencies the remaining 145 transaction currencies are settled in us dollars or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure   our interest sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as investments they are rated aa or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and mediumterm notes with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure based on the net present value of expected future cash flows a 35 100 basis point increase in interest rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of 15 million and 14 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  we own trading securities which are comprised of equity securities held in connection with an executive compensation plan the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of 3 million and 4 million for december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively these securities are part of a deferred executive compensation plan therefore an offsetting gain of 2 million and 3 million for december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively would be recorded in general and administrative expense   at december 31 2002 and 2001 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 36

  because our business is global we have structured our organization to be sensitive to the requirements of the regions and countries in which we operate our global board of directors has delegated authority over a variety of matters including certain rulemaking enforcement and feesetting decisions to regional boards of directors covering each of asia pacific canada europe latin america and the caribbean south asia – middle east africa “samea” and the united states we enter into business agreements with key customers around the globe which allow us to support the individual needs of these customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard at the same time we continue to provide bestinclass service to all our customers irrespective of their size   we conduct our business through mastercard incorporated’s principal operating subsidiary mastercard international incorporated “mastercard international” a delaware membership corporation the principal members of mastercard international and its affiliates are approximately 2300 financial institutions worldwide that participate directly in our payment programs in addition there are approximately 23000 affiliate members of mastercard international and its affiliates that participate in our payment programs through one or more principal members our customers are our principal and affiliate members which we refer to collectively as our “customers” or “members” the common stock of mastercard incorporated is owned by principal members of mastercard international   in europe we conduct our business principally through mastercard europe sprl “mastercard europe” formerly europay international sa a wholly owned subsidiary of mastercard incorporated acquired on june 28 2002 in a transaction that we refer to as the “integration” for a description of the integration and mastercard’s related conversion to a stock company see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein   we refer to the customers that issue our cards as “issuers” and those that enroll merchants into programs to accept our cards as “acquirers” we use the term “mastercard” to refer to the mastercard brand generally and to the business conducted by mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries including mastercard international and mastercard europe payment services   transaction processing   our transaction processing primarily authorization clearing and settlement services are provided to customers through our proprietary worldwide computer and telecommunications network we provide global transaction processing services principally through our global technology and operations headquarters in o’fallon missouri   authorization clearing and settlement the authorization clearing and settlement process facilitates the movement of transaction data and funds among customers on a global basis in a timely and efficient manner   authorization is the process by which a transaction is approved by the issuer or in certain circumstances by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions we processed over 76 billion mastercardbranded authorizations on our global processing systems in 2002 mastercard’s authorization network provides for the transmission of pertinent card account data and authorization results among issuers acquirers and other transaction processors or networks our rules which vary across regions establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 2   clearing is the exchange of financial transaction information between the issuer and the acquirer after a transaction has been completed mastercard transactions are generally cleared through our centralized processing system known as the global clearing management system gcms and the related information is typically routed among customers via our banknet data transport network   once transactions have been authorized and cleared mastercard provides services in connection with the settlement of the transaction—that is the exchange of funds along with associated fees settlement is provided through our settlement account management system sam once clearing is completed a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position the actual exchange of funds takes place between a clearing bank chosen by the customer and approved by mastercard and one of mastercard’s settlement banks customer settlement occurs in us dollars or in other selected currencies in accordance with established rules   we also operate the mastercard debit switch “mds” which principally supports the processing of cirrus and maestro transactions the mds switches financial messages provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs clearing and settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks unlike the authorization and clearing processes described above which involve the exchange of transaction data in two discrete messages one for authorization and again for clearing the mds generally operates as a “single message” system in which clearing occurs simultaneously with the initial authorization request   a significant portion of the domestic as opposed to crossborder transaction activity conducted with mastercard maestro and cirrus cards is authorized cleared andor settled by our customers or other processors without the involvement of mastercard’s central processing systems we do not earn transaction processing fees for such activity we are developing and promoting domestic processing solutions for our customers that are designed to leverage our significant investments in our global and regional processing systems   operations and systems our transaction processing services are available 24 hours per day 365 days per year in the event that our main processing facility in o’fallon missouri becomes disabled we have a backup system located at a separate facility in lake success new york we expect to migrate this backup facility to kansas city missouri during 2003 see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included herein our transaction processing systems have redundant power supplies and backup processes to ensure continued operation in the event of a fault we consistently maintain core systems availability for our global processing systems at a rate in excess of 9999   in 2002 we substantially completed our fiveyear systems enhancement strategy “ses” which was designed to significantly upgrade our core global processing systems to increase flexibility achieve operating efficiencies and improve timetomarket for new services as part of the ses program among other things we migrated our banknet global data transport network to a “virtual private network” “vpn” in conjunction with att our vpn enhancements have significantly reduced transaction processing times and enhanced data security for customers we also successfully introduced gcms to replace our prior clearing system enhancing our processing flexibility and through the introduction of an integrated product message ipm format enhanced our ability to support a richer set of transaction data as of december 31 2002 approximately 98 of all gcms volume was being cleared using the new ipm format   regional transaction processing following the integration we provide transaction processing authorization clearing and settlement services for customers in the europe region through our subsidiary mastercard europe these services which allow european customers to facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants throughout europe are provided via our european payment systems network “epsnet” epsnet is a telecommunications network that interfaces directly with our global banknet system for worldwide retail payment and atm transaction interchange we are presently undertaking a multiyear technical convergence project to fully integrate epsnet with our global processing systems in connection with this initiative we intend to integrate key applications and systems and standardize formats to enhance customer service increase operating efficiencies and reduce processing costs we also operate a separate regional processing facility for the asia pacific region in australia 3   antifraud initiatives   our customers are principally responsible for fraud losses associated with the cards they issue or the merchants from whom they acquire transactions however we develop programs and systems to aid our customers and merchants in detecting and preventing the fraudulent use of cards carrying our brands we prepare sell and distribute a “warning bulletin” to customers showing invalid and other recently terminated account numbers as identified by our customers in addition our member protection program provides among other things a daily report to all card issuers identifying accounts with unusual activity based on the number or size of transactions   we have a number of other prevention initiatives targeted at fraudulent cardholder activity as one example our system to avoid fraud effectively safe program compiles customersubmitted data regarding fraudulent transactions into reports designed to help issuers and acquirers improve fraud detection and prevention in addition our riskfinder® system helps customers to predict fraud and reduce losses by evaluating transactions using a number of variables we also target fraudulent activity at the merchant level for example through our merchant audit program we identify high risk merchants with significant fraudrelated transaction activity and encourage these merchants to implement fraud control procedures our member alert to control highrisk merchants—match program assists acquirers to assess risk before signing a merchant into their mastercard acceptance programs and our merchant audit program monitors merchants worldwide once per month assessing each merchant’s fraud to sales ratio   security and cardholder authentication for remote channels are critical issues facing mastercard’s customers and merchants who engage in electronic commerce transactions where a signed cardholder sales receipt is generally unavailable disputed transactions resulting from “no cardholder authorization” represent a substantial portion of all disputed electronic commerce transactions processed through the mastercard network today mastercard is seeking to address these issues through the implementation of mastercard securecode tm  a global internet authentication solution that permits cardholders to authenticate themselves to their issuer through the use of a unique personal code in addition to help combat the security threats associated with electronic commerce mastercard has developed the mastercard site data protection program this program which is available through our acquirers calls for ecommerce merchants and service providers to assess their security situation on a regular basis for potential vulnerabilities   mastercard rpps   mastercard’s remote payment and presentment service “rpps” is a leading processor of electronic bill payments in the united states rpps provides

mastercard brand for the benefit of all customers through umbrella advertising promotional and sponsorship initiatives we appeal to cardholders to associate the mastercard brand with “the best way to

increase consumer awareness of mastercard and to drive activation usage and retention of mastercard cards we also seek to tailor our global marketing messages by optimizing their use in individual countries while maintaining a common global theme   advertising our advertising plays a critical role in building brand visibility usage and loyalty among cardholders globally our awardwinning

  merchant acceptance initiatives   based on information from our customers and other sources we estimate that at december 31 2002 cards carrying mastercard brands were accepted at over 30 million locations and terminals around the world these results are part of a longerterm trend of substantially increasing mastercard card acceptance in the area of acceptance we aim to maintain the unsurpassed acceptance of mastercardbranded cards by focusing on three core initiatives first we seek to increase the number of payment channels where mastercard cards are accepted such as by introducing mastercard card acceptance in connection with mobile commerce payment applications second we seek to increase the number of categories of merchants that accept our cards we are focused presently on expanding acceptance in electronic commerce environments fast food restaurants and in connection with public sector payments including those in connection with taxes fees fines and tolls among other categories third we seek to increase usage of our cards at selected merchants by sponsoring a range of promotional programs from time to time we also enter into brand preference agreements with merchants in connection with which merchants commit to expressing their preference for mastercardbranded cards when accepting payments from consumers   we also support technical initiatives designed to make card acceptance more attractive for specific merchants such as our quick payment service for fast food restaurants and other merchants where rapid transactions are required in december 2002 we initiated a market trial of mastercard paypass tm  a new “contactless” radio frequency chip solution that enables consumers simply to tap or wave their payment card on a specially equipped terminal for merchants mastercard paypass is designed to be simpler and faster than cash helping to speed consumers through the payment process   we view recurring payments as a significant opportunity to expand mastercard card acceptance and usage in the united states and elsewhere and we are working with customers to encourage consumers to make recurring bill payments in a variety of categories — including telephone cable utilities and insurance – on their mastercardbranded cards   cobranded affinity cards   we provide research marketing support and financial assistance to our customers and their partners in connection with the launch and marketing of cobranded and affinity card programs cobranded cards are payment cards bearing the logos or other insignia of an issuer and

acceptance network and the mastercard atm network debit cards carrying the mastercard brand allow cardholders to validate transactions at the point of sale either by signing a sales receipt or if the card also bears a maestro or atm network mark and the merchant has the necessary terminal by entering a personal identification number “pin” at a terminal like our consumer credit programs we support debit gold mastercard programs and debit platinum mastercard programs that issuers can offer as premium services to cardholders issuers may also provide enhancement services and loyalty rewards programs in connection with debit cards carrying our brands in the united states all mastercard debit cards benefit from the same core enhancements available on mastercard credit cards   maestro is mastercard’s online pinbased global debit program typically maestro cards allow cardholders to verify their identities by entering a pin although in certain countries cardholders are required to sign a sales receipt maestro cards are issued and maestro transactions are processed pursuant to a set of rules and procedures that are separate from the rules applicable to mastercard credit and debit transactions international travel and other services including emergency cash disbursement and lost and stolen card reporting are available on an optional basis to maestro cardholders through maestro global service from mastercard based on information from our customers and other sources we estimate that at december 31 2002 the maestro brand mark appeared on approximately 505 million cards

international and its affiliates is open to banks and other regulated and supervised financial institutions applicants for membership must meet membership eligibility requirements and must be approved by the appropriate regional mastercard board of directors in general mastercard staff grants licenses by territory to be approved as a member an applicant must be able to perform all obligations required of members risk management reviews and money laundering due diligence reviews are conducted on all new members prior to admission and are updated from time to time licenses for mastercardbranded payment programs are granted by mastercard international except in europe where mastercard europe acts as mastercard international’s licensing agent licenses for cirrus and maestrobranded programs are generally granted by the mastercard affiliates responsible for these brands   as a condition of membership and licenses to use our brands members agree to comply with our by laws policies rules and operating regulations in effect from time to time “standards” mastercard international and certain of its affiliates are the governing bodies that establish and enforce the standards the standards relate to such matters as membership eligibility and financial soundness criteria the standards design and features of cards and card programs the use of mastercard trademarks merchant acquiring activities including acceptance standards applicable to merchants and guaranteed settlement member failures and allocation of losses   to help ensure that members conform to the standards we run a number of compliance programs including reviewing card programs proposed to be issued by members and requiring members to undergo an annual audit by an independent certified public accountant or similar examination by a regulatory authority to tailor mastercard’s programs and services to the needs of local markets our global andor regional boards have approved a number of variations to the standards applicable to specific regions in 2002 in connection with the integration transaction the rules and regulations previously managed by europay international sa for the mastercard brand were incorporated into mastercard’s global standards with appropriate variations for that region   member risk management   as a secondary obligor for certain card obligations of principal members we are exposed to member credit risk arising from the potential failure of any of our approximately 2300 principal members of mastercard maestro and cirrus and approximately 2600 affiliate debit licensees principal members participate directly in mastercard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate members numbering approximately 23000 in total principal members and affiliate debit licensees that do not meet mastercard’s credit risk standards may be required to provide mastercard with collateral such as standby letters of credit or cash deposits when deemed necessary by management   to minimize the contingent risk to mastercard of a failure we monitor principal members’ and affiliate debit licensees’ financial health economic operating environments and compliance with our rules and standards if the financial condition of a member or the state of a national economy in which a member operates indicates that a member may not be able to satisfy its mastercard settlement obligations to other members or its payment obligations to mastercard merchants we may require the member to post collateral sufficient to cover the potential exposure in the event of such member’s failure if an issuing bank is potentially unable to meet its obligations to us we can block authorization and settlement of transactions and ultimately terminate membership   for liquidity protection in the event of member settlement failure we have established a 12 billion committed credit facility which is subject to annual renewal in addition we have the right to assess all or a portion of our members for reimbursement for settlement losses member credit losses or any other operating losses subject to certain limitations set forth in the bylaws and other standards of mastercard incorporated 11   for a description of our exposure to settlement and travelers’ cheque risk see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included herein intellectual property   we own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business including mastercard® maestro® and cirrus® through one or more affiliates we also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands programs and services offered by mastercard to support our payment programs through license agreements with our customers we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers’ card issuing and merchant acquiring businesses trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes and we emphasize the correct use of our trademarks both within our company and by our members in addition we own a number of patents relating to payments solutions transaction processing smart cards security systems and other matters none of our patents is material to our business operations competition   mastercard programs compete against all forms of payment including paperbased transactions principally cash and checks and electronic transactions such as wire transfers and automated clearing house “ach” payments while we have gained share versus cash and checks in recent years these forms of payment still capture the largest overall percentage of worldwide transaction volume within the global general purpose card industry we believe that visa may have approximately twice our volume in certain countries other competitors also have leading positions such as jcb in japan   the most common cardbased forms of payment are general purpose cards which are payment cards carrying logos that permit widespread usage of the cards within countries regions or around the world general purpose cards may be credit charge or deposit access cards within the general purpose payment card industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from systems such as visa including plus electron and interlink american express jcb diners club and carte blanche among others in specific countries we face significant competition from other competitors such as discover novus united states interac canada and bankcard and eftpos australia we also encounter competition from businesses such as retail stores and petroleum gasoline companies that issue their own payment cards as well as from atmpointofsale networks such as fdc nyce concord efs star pulse and others some of our competitors have substantially greater capital and resources than we have   our competitors include operators of proprietary endtoend payment networks that have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with cardholders such as american express these competitors have certain advantages that we do not enjoy through mastercard international the mastercard business is structured as an open bankcard association in which cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers accordingly in addition to proprietary endtoend networks we compete intensely with other bankcard associations principally visa for the loyalty of our customers in most countries throughout the world including the united states financial institutions typically issue both mastercard and visabranded payment cards as a result of this structure known as “duality” we compete with visa for business on the basis of individual card portfolios or programs in some countries particularly canada card issuers are “nondual” meaning that they issue either mastercard or visa payment cards but not both issuance of mastercard and visa debit cards is generally nondual in the united states as well in nondual countries we compete with visa for the entire book of a customer’s business significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with visa resulting in the loss of business for mastercard   we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems among other things these competitors provide internet currencies that can be used to buy and sell goods online “virtual checking” programs that permit the direct debit of consumer checking accounts for online payments and services that support payments to and from proprietary accounts for internet mobile commerce and other 12 applications a number of these new entrants rely principally on the internet to support their services and may enjoy lower costs than we do 

  we face competition from transaction processors such as first data corporation some of which are seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services these networks could reduce our transaction processing volumes   in mobile commerce we face competition from established network operators who today manage millions of consumer relationships and possess key advantages for facilitating payments across mobile devices whereas the mastercard approach to mobile commerce centers on the use of the consumer’s payment account as established by their card issuer network operators may apply mobile consumer payments directly to the customer’s monthly bill   we believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive position in the global payments industry are  government regulation   mastercard is subject to a variety of employment health and safety environmental and other forms of government regulation in the ordinary course of its business mastercard customers are subject to numerous regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in the united states and elsewhere and as a consequence mastercard is at times impacted by such regulations certain of mastercard’s operations are subject to periodic audits by the federal financial institutions examination council in addition aspects of our operations or business may be subject to privacy regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere as well as regulations imposed by the us office of foreign asset control   our subsidiary mastercard europe operates a retail payment system in europe and effective in 2003 is subject to oversight by the national bank of belgium “nbb” pursuant to standards published by the european central bank the nbb’s oversight of mastercard europe is principally addressed at managing financial legal and operations risk it will take the form of routine contacts between mastercard europe and the nbb an exchange of informationstatistical reporting and an obligation on the part of mastercard europe to report any major incidents in the areas of settlement network infrastructure and fraud to the nbb   in 2002 participants in the payment industry including mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 the “usa patriot act” the usa patriot act has required mastercard to create and implement a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and has imposed similar requirements on our customers   except as stated above or in the description of legal proceedings contained in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included herein government regulation did not have a material impact on mastercard in 2002 and mastercard does not expect that government regulation will have a material impact on its business or financial condition in 2003 13 employees   as of december 31 2002 we employed approximately 4000 persons of which approximately 1300 were employed outside the united states we consider our relationship with our employees to be good sec reports   our periodic reports filed with the us securities and exchange commission are available for review on our website at wwwmastercardintlcom risk factors if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our customers or if our customers are unable to maintain their relationships with cardholders or with the merchants who accept our cards for payment our business may be adversely affected   we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on a number of relationships with other parties principally our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their further relationships with cardholders and merchants to support our programs and services most of our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of our customers we cannot assure you that our customers will not reassess their commitments to us at any time in the future or that they will not develop their own competitive services in particular the payments industry is currently undergoing significant consolidations and the merger of one or more of our customers with financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects   our business strategy calls for us to increase our share by among other things entering into business agreements with customers around the globe like our other customer relationships these agreements are terminable by our customers in a variety of circumstances examples of provisions appearing in various agreements currently in effect that may permit a customer to terminate its agreement include    a number of our key customers are represented on our board of directors if any one of these customers were to lose its representation on the board this could have a detrimental effect on our business relationship with that customer conversely a number of customers that make substantial contributions to our revenues including bank one delaware na are principally aligned with one of our competitors a significant loss of revenues or transaction volumes from these customers could have an adverse impact on our business   in addition we may be required to permit issuers with which we have entered into business agreements in the united states to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the antitrust litigation currently on appeal that was brought against us by the united states department of justice which is described in a separate risk factor below accordingly our business agreements with customers may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of our competitors or for other reasons or might not meet their contractual obligations to us   we do not issue cards set cardholder fees or determine the interest rates if applicable charged to cardholders using cards that carry our brands each mastercard issuer is responsible for determining these and most other competitive card features in addition we do not solicit merchants to process transactions or establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for card acceptance which are responsibilities of our acquirers as a result much of our business depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our customers in turn our customers’ success is dependent upon a variety of factors over which we have little or 14 no influence if our customers become financially unstable we may lose the revenue that we generate by charging them operations fees and assessments or we may be exposed to settlement risk as described below 

  we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our brands of cards although it is our business strategy to invest in strengthening our brands and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry   the global payments industry is highly competitive we compete with all forms of payment including cash checks and electronic forms of payment among general purpose payment cards we encounter constant and intense competition from systems such as visa and its related brands including plus electron and interlink american express jcb diners club and carte blanche in specific countries we face significant competition from other competitors such as discover novus interac bankcard and eftpos we also encounter competition from businesses such as retail stores and petroleum gasoline companies that issue their own privatelabel cards as well as from atmpointofsale networks such as fdc nyce concord efs star pulse and others we also compete against new entrants that have developed alternative payment systems that can compete effectively with mastercard for payment transactions and volume in mobile commerce we compete against established network operators that possess key advantages for facilitating payments across mobile devices   some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have within the global general purpose card industry we believe that visa may have approximately twice our purchase volume in certain countries other of our competitors have leading positions such as jcb in japan in addition american express discover novus and others control proprietary endtoend payment systems in which they extend payment privileges to consumers and businesses and establish transaction processing relationships directly with merchants in our case both of these functions are the responsibility of our customers these endtoend systems provide our competitors with certain competitive advantages that we do not enjoy we may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these threats and as a result our revenues or income may decline   over the last several years the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation and we expect this trend to continue in the future consolidation represents a competitive threat for mastercard because our business strategy contemplates entering into business agreements with our largest customers in exchange for significant business commitments to mastercard accordingly the merger of one or more of our significant customers with financial institutions that have strong relationships with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects in addition one or more of our customers could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitors and any such transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects   we also face competition from transaction processors such as first data corporation some of whom are seeking to build networks that link issuers directly with pointofsale devices for payment card transaction authorization and processing services these networks could reduce our own transaction processing volumes which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues   in addition our business and revenues could be impacted adversely by any tendency among us consumers or financial institutions to migrate from offline signature based debit transactions to online pinbased transactions because the latter types of transactions are more likely to be processed by atmpointofsale networks as opposed to ourselves 15 global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our revenues   the global payments industry is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions particularly in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average ticket size of transactions involving payment cards carrying our brands in addition a significant portion of the volume generated on cards carrying our brands is associated with crossborder business and leisure travel which may be adversely affected by world geopolitical conditions if we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers merchants and cardholders with new and innovative payment programs and services the use of mastercardbranded cards could decline which would reduce our revenues and income   the payment card industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes such as continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards radio frequency and proximity payment devices electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our card programs and services our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and to provide endtoend payment solutions for our customers   in many circumstances we believe that the payment card industry should create and we are working to forge industry standards to allow for the compatibility of various card programs and technologies the industry however may not set standards on a timely basis or at all or we may develop a program or technology that is not adapted as an industry standard these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and income if our transaction processing systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions securely efficiently or at all our revenues or income would be materially reduced   our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire natural disasters power loss disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access terrorism or accident most of our transaction processing systems are operated out of a single facility supported by a separate backup facility a natural disaster or other problem at our primary andor backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities could interrupt our services additionally we rely on thirdparty service providers such as att for the timely transmission of information across our global data transportation network if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our services and adversely affect the perception of our brands’ reliability and our revenues or income   in addition our security protection measures including with respect to the security of transaction information processed on our systems or the systems or processing technology of third parties participating in our network may not be sufficient to prevent the fraudulent or other improper use of cards carrying our brands unauthorized use of our network potentially could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or transmitted by our customers or others these factors may result in liabilities for us or our customers and could reduce our revenues and income in every mastercard card transaction there is a risk that the issuer or acquirer will default in its payment obligations because we are a secondary obligor for certain card obligations among principal members one or more defaults could expose us to significant losses   as a secondary obligor for certain card obligations among principal members we are exposed to settlement risk from our members settlement exposure materializes when an issuer or acquirer fails to fund daily settlement obligations due to technical reasons liquidity shortfall or other reasons for any member our settlement exposure is comprised of the estimated dollar value of issuing and chargeback transactions that we would need to fund in order to satisfy the member’s mastercard maestro or cirrusrelated obligations to other members if a principal member is unable to fulfill its settlement obligations to other members we may 16 bear the loss even if we do not otherwise process the transaction in addition although we are not contractually obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchants whole in the event that an acquirer defaults on its merchant payment obligations in order to maintain the integrity and acceptance of our brands accordingly one or more member defaults could expose us to significant losses and reduce our net income 

  the continuation of negative economic conditions in 2002 has caused significant increases in consumer bankruptcies and writeoffs of consumer credit card loans by members these conditions have caused the credit quality of certain members to deteriorate in turn including in the united states argentina and brazil in other countries such as japan and turkey the banking system as a whole has been the subject of declining credit quality any decrease in the credit quality of a member would increase the risk of member default which as noted above could expose us to significant losses and reduce our net income in the alternative credit quality issues could cause certain of our members to reduce the scope of their businesses or exit the payment card business entirely which could negatively impact our revenues mastercard cannot predict the outcome or impact of antitrust claims by the us department of justice   in october 1998 the united states department of justice “doj” filed suit against mastercard international visa usa inc and visa international corp in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging that both mastercard’s and visa’s governance structure and policies violated us federal antitrust laws first the doj claimed that “dual governance” — the situation where a financial institution has a representative on the board of directors of mastercard or visa while a portion of its card portfolio is issued under the brand of the other association — was anticompetitive and acted to limit innovation within the payment card industry at the same time the doj conceded that “dual issuance” — a term describing the structure of the bank card industry in the united states in which a single financial institution can issue both mastercard and visabranded cards — was procompetitive second the doj challenged mastercard’s competitive programs policy “cpp” and a visa bylaw provision that prohibit financial institutions participating in the respective associations from issuing competing proprietary payment cards such as american express or discover the doj alleged that mastercard’s cpp and visa’s bylaw provision acted to restrain competition   mastercard denied the doj’s allegations mastercard believes that both “dual governance” and the cpp are procompetitive and fully consistent with us federal antitrust law   a bench trial concerning the doj’s allegations was concluded on august 22 2000 on october 9 2001 the district court judge issued an opinion upholding the legality and procompetitive nature of dual governance in so doing the judge specifically found that mastercard and visa have competed vigorously over the years that prices to consumers have dropped dramatically and that mastercard has fostered rapid innovations in systems product offerings and services   however the judge also held that mastercard’s cpp and the visa bylaw constitute unlawful restraints of trade under the federal antitrust laws the judge found that the cpp and visa bylaw weakened competition and harmed consumers by preventing competing proprietary payment card networks such as american express and discover from entering into agreements with banks to issue cards on their networks in reaching this decision the judge found that two distinct markets — a credit and charge card issuing market and a network services market — existed in the united states and that both mastercard and visa had market power in the network market mastercard strongly disputes these findings and believes that the doj failed among other things to demonstrate that us consumers have been harmed by the cpp   on november 26 2001 the judge issued a final judgment that orders mastercard to repeal the cpp insofar as it applies to issuers and enjoins mastercard from enacting or enforcing any bylaw rule policy or practice that prohibits its issuers from issuing general purpose credit or debit cards in the united states on any other general purpose card network the judge also concluded that during the period in which the cpp was in effect mastercard was able to “lock up” certain members by entering into longterm agreements with them pursuant to which the members committed to maintain a certain percentage of their general purpose card volume new card issuance or total number of cards in force in the united states on mastercard’s network accordingly the final judgment provides that there will be a period commencing on the effective date of the 17 judgment and ending on the later of two years from that date or two years from the resolution of any final appeal during which mastercard will be required to permit any issuer with which it entered into such an agreement prior to the effective date of the final judgment to terminate that agreement without penalty provided that the reason for the termination is to permit the issuer to enter into an agreement with american express or discover mastercard would be free to apply to the district court to recover funds paid but not yet earned under any terminated agreement the final judgment imposes parallel requirements on visa the judge explicitly provided that mastercard and visa would be free to enter into new partnership or member business agreements in the future 

  mastercard believes that it has a strong legal basis to challenge the judge’s ruling with respect to the cpp and has appealed the decision on that count on february 6 2002 the judge issued an order granting mastercard’s and visa’s motion to stay the final judgment pending appeal mastercard the doj and other parties to the doj antitrust litigation completed their submission of appellate briefs to the second circuit court of appeals in late august 2002 and presently are awaiting a date for oral argument on the appeal of the us district court’s decision in this case mastercard believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have on mastercard’s results of operations financial position or cash flows mastercard cannot predict the outcome or impact of a class action lawsuit by us merchants against mastercard   commencing in october 1996 several class action suits were brought by a number of us merchants — including walmart stores inc sears roebuck  co inc the limited inc and safeway inc — against mastercard international and visa usa inc challenging certain aspects of the payment card industry under us federal antitrust law those suits were later consolidated in the us district court for the eastern district of new york the plaintiffs challenge mastercard’s “honor all cards” rule and a similar visa rule which ensures universal acceptance for consumers by requiring merchants who accept mastercard cards to accept for payment every validly presented mastercard card plaintiffs claim that mastercard and visa unlawfully have tied acceptance of debit cards to acceptance of credit cards in essence the merchants desire the ability to reject offline signaturebased debit transactions for example mastercard card transactions in favor of other payment forms including online pinbased debit transactions for example maestro or regional atm network transactions which generally impose lower transaction costs for merchants the plaintiffs also claim that mastercard and visa have conspired to monopolize what they characterize as the pointofsale debit card market thereby suppressing the growth of regional networks such as atm payment systems plaintiffs allege that the plaintiff class has been forced to pay unlawfully high prices for debit and credit card transactions as a result of the alleged tying arrangement and monopolization practices there are related consumer class actions pending in two state courts that have been stayed pending developments in this matter   mastercard denies the merchant allegations and believes that the “honor all cards” rule and mastercard practices with respect to debit card programs in the united states are procompetitive and fully consistent with us federal antitrust law   on february 22 2000 the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification mastercard and visa subsequently appealed the decision to the second circuit court of appeals on october 17 2001 a threejudge panel affirmed the lower court decision by a twotoone majority mastercard filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the us supreme court on april 3 2002 which was denied on june 6 2002   motions seeking summary judgment have been filed by both sides and fully briefed in the district court arguments for summary judgment motions were held on january 10 2003 the district court judge reserved decision on the motions a trial date of april 28 2003 has been set   based upon publicly available information the plaintiffs previously have asserted damage claims in this litigation of approximately 8 billion before any trebling under us federal antitrust law other public estimates including estimates set forth in the dissenting opinion of the second circuit place the plaintiffs’ estimated damage claims at approximately 50 billion to 100 billion depending on the source in addition 18 the plaintiffs’ damage claims could be materially higher than these amounts as a result of the passage of time and substantive changes in the theory of damages presented by the plaintiffs these figures reflect claims asserted and should not be construed as an acknowledgement of the reliability of the figures presented mastercard believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have on mastercard’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  several lawsuits have been commenced by merchants who have opted not to participate in the class action litigation thus far separate lawsuits have been commenced by meijer stores toys “r” us giant eagle and home depot mastercard is seeking to have all of these cases transferred to the us district court for the eastern district of new york mastercard cannot predict the outcome or impact of various lawsuits relating to its currency conversion practices   mastercard international together with visa usa inc and visa international corp are defendants in a state court lawsuit pending in california the lawsuit alleges that mastercard and visa wrongfully imposed an asserted one percent currency conversion “fee” on every credit card transaction by us mastercard and visa cardholders involving the purchase of goods or services in a foreign country and that such alleged “fee” is unlawful this action titled schwartz v visa int’l corp et al was brought in the superior court of california in february 2000 purportedly on behalf of the general public trial of the schwartz matter commenced on may 20 2002 and concluded on november 27 2002 the schwartz action claims that the alleged “fee” grossly exceeds any costs the defendants might incur in connection with currency conversions relating to credit card purchase transactions made in foreign countries and is not properly disclosed to cardholders plaintiffs seek to prevent defendants from continuing to engage in use or employ the alleged practice of charging and collecting the asserted one percent currency conversion “fee” and from charging any type of purported currency conversion “fee” without providing a clear obvious and comprehensive notice that a fee will be charged plaintiffs also request an order 1 requiring defendants to fund a corrective advertising campaign and 2 awarding restitution of the monies allegedly wrongfully acquired by imposing the purported currency conversion “fee” the complaints assert that during the fouryear period that preceded the respective lawsuits mastercard collected approximately 200 million as a result of allegedly imposing the claimed one percent currency conversion “fee” mastercard denies these allegations   on february 5 2003 the trial court judge issued a preliminary decision in the schwartz matter which is under seal in his decision the trial judge found that mastercard’s currency conversion process does not violate the truth in lending act or regulations nor is it unconscionably priced under california law however the judge found that the practice is deceptive under california state law and ordered that mastercard mandate that members disclose the currency conversion process to cardholders in cardholder agreements applications solicitations and monthly billing statements the judge also ordered unspecified restitution to california cardholders the parties filed objections to the preliminary decision on february 27 2003 a hearing on the objections was held on march 4 2003 if the decision is not modified prior to becoming final mastercard presently intends to appeal the decision   mastercard international visa usa inc visa international corp several member banks including citibank south dakota na citibank nevada na chase manhattan bank usa na bank of america na usa mbna and diners club are defendants in a number of federal putative class actions that allege among other things violations of federal antitrust laws based on the asserted one percent currency conversion “fee”   pursuant to an order of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation the federal complaints have been consolidated in mdl no 1409 before judge william h pauley iii in the us district court for the southern district of new york in january 2002 the federal plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint “mdl complaint” adding mbna corporation and mbna america bank na as defendants this pleading asserts two theories of antitrust conspiracy under section 1 of the sherman act 15 usc §1 i an alleged “interassociation” conspiracy among mastercard together with its members visa 19 together with its members and diners club to fix currency conversion “fees” allegedly charged to cardholders of “no less than 1 of the transaction amount and frequently more” and ii two alleged “intra association” conspiracies whereby each of visa and mastercard is claimed separately to have conspired with its members to fix currency conversion “fees” allegedly charged to cardholders of “no less than 1 of the transaction amount” and “to facilitate and encourage institution — and collection — of second tier currency conversion surcharges” the mdl complaint also asserts that the alleged currency conversion “fees” have not been disclosed as required by the truth in lending act and regulation z 

  defendants have moved to dismiss the mdl complaint oral argument on that motion was held on june 21 2002 and judge pauley reserved decision pending determination of defendants’ motion to dismiss the parties may engage in discovery except for noncustodial depositions no trial date has been set   mastercard believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have on its results of operations financial position or cash flows mastercard cannot predict the outcome or impact of various legal andor regulatory proceedings in jurisdictions around the globe relating to interchange fees   interchange fees represent a sharing of payment system costs among the financial institutions participating in a fourparty payment card system such as mastercard’s generally interchange fees are paid by acquirers to issuers in connection with transactions initiated with the payment system’s cards these fees reimburse the issuer for a portion of the costs incurred by it in providing services which are of benefit to all participants in the system including acquirers and merchants mastercard establishes a multilateral interchange fee “mif” in certain circumstances as a default fee that applies when there is no other interchange fee arrangement between the issuer and the acquirer mastercard establishes a variety of mif rates depending on such considerations as the location and the type of transaction and collects the mif on behalf of the institutions entitled to receive it but does not itself receive the mif as described more fully below mifs are subject to regulatory or legal review andor challenges in a number of jurisdictions mastercard believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have on its results of operations financial position or cash flows   european union in september 2000 the european commission issued a “statement of objections” challenging visa international’s crossborder mif under european community competition rules on july 24 2002 the european commission announced its decision to exempt the visa mif from these rules based on certain changes proposed by visa to its mif among other things in connection with the exemption order visa agreed to adopt a costbased methodology for calculating its mif similar to the methodology employed by mastercard which considers the costs of certain specified services provided by issuers and to reduce its mif rates for debit and credit transactions to amounts at or below certain specified levels   although mastercard europe is not an addressee of the statement of objections its rules also contain a crossborder mif mastercard europe intends to engage in discussions with the european commission in order to determine under what conditions the european commission would grant a formal exemption or comfort letter for mastercard europe’s mif because the crossborder mif constitutes an essential element of mastercard europe’s operations changes to it could significantly impact mastercard international’s european members and the mastercard business in europe at this time it is not possible to determine what action the european commission will take with respect to mastercard europe’s mif   united kingdom office of fair trading on september 25 2001 the office of fair trading of the united kingdom “oft” issued a statement of objections “soo” under the uk competition act 1998 challenging the mastercard mif the fee paid by the acquiring bank to the issuing bank in connection with point of sale transactions and multilateral service fee “msf” the fee paid by issuing banks to acquiring banks when a customer uses a mastercardbranded card in the united kingdom either at an atm or over the counter to obtain a cash advance established by mastercard uk members forum limited formerly mepuk for domestic credit card transactions in the united kingdom the soo contained preliminary conclusions to the effect that the mastercard uk mif and msf may infringe uk competition law and do 20 not qualify for an exemption in their present forms in january 2002 mastercard mepuk and several mastercard uk members responded to the soo and an oral hearing concerning the matter was held on february 5 2002 on february 11 2003 the oft issued an amended soo which also contains preliminary conclusions that challenge mastercard’s uk mif under the competition act 

  because the mif and msf constitute essential elements of mastercard’s uk operations changes to these fees could significantly impact mastercard’s uk members and the mastercard business in the uk at this time it is not possible to determine what action the oft will take with respect to the mastercard mif and msf   australia on august 27 2002 the reserve bank of australia “rba” announced regulations under the payments systems regulation act 1998 the “act” applicable to fourparty credit card payment systems in australia including mastercard’s the rba regulations would impose a number of changes on the operation of fourparty credit card systems that could significantly impact mastercard international’s australian members and the mastercard business in australia among other things the rba regulations permit nondeposittaking institutions to issue credit cards and acquire credit card transactions in australia mandate a formula for calculating interchange fees that fails to account for certain costs incurred by issuers such as credit losses and effectively requires a reduction in domestic interchange fees and prohibit mastercard and other fourparty credit card systems from enforcing their respective “no surcharge” and “net issuer” rules the no surcharge rule generally prevents merchants from charging supplemental fees for the use of payment cards at the point of sale and the net issuer rule requires institutions participating in the relevant system to issue payment cards in addition to conducting merchant acquiring activities   on september 20 2002 mastercard filed an application with the federal court of australia seeking to overturn the rba regulations mastercard believes that in implementing the regulations the rba has failed to comply with the obligations imposed upon it by the act among other things mastercard believes that the rba regulations fail to satisfy the public interest test mandated by the act because they can be expected to impose additional costs on australian consumers place small businesses at a competitive disadvantage to larger retailers and encourage small or regional banks to exit the credit card business in australia visa international corp filed a similar application with the federal court of australia on september 19 2002 a hearing on the matter is scheduled to begin on may 19 2003 at this time it is not possible to determine the outcome of mastercard’s legal challenge to the rba regulations   united states in july 2002 a putative class action lawsuit was filed by a group of merchants in the us district court for the northern district of california against mastercard international visa usa inc visa international corp and several member banks in california alleging among other things that mastercard’s and visa’s interchange fees contravene the sherman act the suit seeks treble damages in an unspecified amount attorney’s fees and injunctive relief including the divestiture of bank ownership of mastercard and visa and the elimination of mastercard and visa marketing activities defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on september 10 2002 the motion has been fully briefed the case was recently reassigned to a new judge in federal district court in san francisco neither an oral argument date on the motion nor a trial date has been set in this matter   other jurisdictions mastercard is aware that regulatory authorities in certain other jurisdictions including japan poland and hong kong are reviewing mastercard’s andor its members interchange fee practices and may seek to regulate the establishment of such fees the payments industry is the subject of increased regulatory focus in the united states and elsewhere which may impose costly new compliance burdens on mastercard or lead to decreased transaction volumes through mastercard’s systems   regulation of the payments industry including regulations applicable to mastercard and our customers has increased significantly in recent years for example in 2002 mastercard became subject to the regulatory requirements of section 352a of the usa patriot act the usa patriot act has required mastercard to create and implement a comprehensive antimoney laundering program and has imposed similar requirements on our customers the us congress is presently considering regulatory initiatives in the 21 areas of identity theft and internet gambling that could impose additional compliance burdens on mastercard or our customers various regulatory agencies are also considering regulations covering identity theft account maintenance guidelines and telemarketing that would impact directly our customers increased regulatory focus on mastercard may increase our costs which would negatively impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customers may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems which would reduce our revenues and also negatively impact our financial performance 

our business may be adversely impacted by the european union’s adoption of regulation on crossborder payments denominated in euros   in december 2001 the european parliament and the council of the european union adopted a new regulation requiring that bank charges for crossborder payments denominated in euros be the same as for similar transactions within a single member state this regulation is being adopted incrementally through january 2006 payments in noneuro currencies will also be subject to the regulation if the member states where those currencies are used notify the european commission that they want the rules to apply because a reduction in crossborder transaction fees will reduce the profitability of certain services offered by mastercard’s european customers it may cause them to modify or withdraw these services if such changes result in an overall decline in transaction volumes our revenues from european operations may decline because we have significant international operations we face additional risks related to global political and economic conditions   we operate in and intend to expand our business further in countries throughout the world we cannot be sure that we will be able to broaden our global operations in a costeffective manner or compete effectively in all of our targeted countries there are risks inherent in conducting business internationally any of which could adversely affect our operations including    if these risks materialize they could have a material adverse effect on our business we cannot assure you that we will continue to develop and implement effective policies and strategies in each location where we do business adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenues we receive from our international operations   during 2002 approximately 39 of our revenues were generated from activities outside the united states some of the revenues we generate outside the united states are subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the values of international currencies change relative to the us dollar resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our revenue 22 currencies into us dollars the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business

   revenue was 1892 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1611 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 281 million or 17 of which 143 million or 9 was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe our revenue is comprised of operations fees and assessments on january 1 2002 we implemented emerging issues task force issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” “eitf 019” and reclassified as a reduction of revenue certain payments to customers and merchants that were previously recognized as advertising and market development expense we anticipate that future revenue growth will be moderated by additional investments in our business   operations fees represent user fees for authorization clearing settlement and other products and services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis operations fees are generally driven by transactions the number of transactions processed increased to approximately 8943 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to approximately 7765 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of approximately 15 the preceding figure reflects certain revisions to the previously reported number of transactions processed using the revised information processed transactions for the three and nine months ended september 30 2002 were 2339 billion and 6479 billion respectively during the yearended december 31 2002 mastercard brandedtransactions including transactions not processed by the company increased to approximately 13577 billion from approximately 11731 billion in the prior year an increase of approximately 16 mastercard europe transactions are included in both 26 periods operations fees were 1231 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1083 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 149 million or 14 approximately 69 million of operations fees in 2002 were due to the acquisition of mastercard europe increases in operations fees were partially offset by a 9 million decline in warning bulletin revenue in the year ended december 31 2002 compared to the year ended december 31 2001 exclusive of mastercard europe’s warning bulletin revenue operations fees were also offset by lower average pricing based on the company’s pricing structure which rewards customers with lower prices for incremental volume and a 13 million increase in rebates provided to customers in the year ended december 31 2002 over the same period in 2001 

  assessments predominantly represent payments made by members of mastercard international in respect of their card programs carrying the marks of one or more of the brands within the mastercard family of brands principally the mastercard maestro and cirrus brands assessments were approximately 660 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 528 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of approximately 132 million or 25 approximately 75 million of our assessments in 2002 were due to our acquisition of mastercard europe in addition the increase in assessments was attributable to an increase in gross dollar volume “gdv” between the periods gdv represents gross usage purchase and cash disbursements on mastercard cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks gdv growth in 2002 as compared to 2001 was approximately 15 when measured in local currency and approximately 16 when measured on a us dollar converted basis gdv was 1142 trillion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 986 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 gdv includes mastercard europe activity in both periods presented offsetting the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers which increased by 53 million in the year ended december 31 2002 over the same period in 2001 a significant portion of the increase was related to the acquisition of mastercard europe   operating expenses were 1750 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 1390 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 360 million or 26 our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development depreciation and amortization expenses operating expenses increased 169 million due to our acquisition of mastercard europe we expect to continue to invest significantly primarily in advertising and marketing support over the next several years to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard and its customers the primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition promote brand acceptance and to enhance the development of our programs and services there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful we expect operating expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as a result of these initiatives   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel telecommunications data processing travel and professional fees general and administrative expenses were 965 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 814 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 151 million or 19 this increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs of 105 million resulting from increases in additional personnel including the impact of the acquisition of mastercard europe and salary increases in 2002 approximately 78 million of general and administrative expenses in 2002 were due to the acquisition of mastercard europe general and administrative expenses include net foreign exchange losses of 2 million and 7 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively these net foreign exchange losses primarily result from forward contracts   for the year ended december 31 2002 we made significant investments in advertising and market development to build value in our brands and to develop programs to differentiate ourselves from our competition advertising and market development expenses were 694 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 506 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 188 million or 37 primarily consisting of a 91 million increase in advertising expense a 74 million increase in promotions and sponsorships expense and a 23 million increase in marketing expense approximately 73 million of advertising and market development expenses in 2002 were due to the acquisition of mastercard europe   our increased advertising and market development expenses were related to a number of key initiatives in 2002 mastercard was a sponsor of the 2002 fifa world cup which required a significant amount of resources in 2002 for the sponsorship fee special programming promotions and event marketing other 27 significant sponsorships during 2002 included major league baseball and the professional golf association mastercard also incurred increased advertising spending for special programming associated with the grammy and academy awards in 2002 we significantly increased our investment in advertising and market support to increase brand recognition and promote brand acceptance we plan to accelerate and increase the investment in advertising as well as other programs and sponsorships in 2003 and for several years thereafter 

  depreciation expense was 40 million in each of the years ended december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 during 2001 certain assets were written off due to the move to our winghaven technology center see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included herein accordingly the company’s depreciation expense decreased in 2002 this decrease in depreciation was offset by approximately 7 million of depreciation expense that was due to the acquisition of mastercard europe   amortization expense was 51 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 20 million this increase was primarily driven by 11 million of amortization expense due to the acquisition of mastercard europe as well as additional amortization of capitalized computer software   other income expense was 16 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 11 million for the year ended december 31 2001 an increase of 5 million other income expense comprises primarily interest dividend and other investment income related to the portfolio of investments held as well as interest expense minority interest and other expense the acquisition of mastercard europe accounted for 2 million of the increase in other income and expense   the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased to 265 from 390  for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to several items some of which are not expected to recur in december 2002 the belgium statutory tax rate was reduced from 402 to 340 as a result deferred income tax liabilities established in connection with the acquisition of mastercard europe were reduced based on the lower belgian income tax rate in addition we anticipate settling certain tax examinations on a favorable basis the effective tax rate was also decreased by a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income in the united states from jurisdictions with higher state tax rates to those with lower rates furthermore we realized significant foreign tax credits that we were previously unable to claim the benefits of these items in lowering the effective tax rate were partially offset by a onetime increase in state income tax expense attributable to lower deferred state tax assets as a result of lower state tax rates   as a result of the foregoing our net income was 116 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 142 million for the year ended december 31 2001 a decrease of 26 million or 18 the net loss of 7 million resulting from the acquisition of mastercard europe contributed to the decrease in net income for the year ended december 31 2002 the initiatives discussed above which involve significant expenditures to support and build value in the mastercard family of brands could result in lower net income or slower net income growth over the next several years

of brands principally mastercard maestro and cirrus brands assessments were 528 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 475 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 53 million or 11 the increase in assessments was attributable primarily to an increase in gdv between the periods gdv represents gross usage purchase and cash disbursements on mastercard cards for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks gdv growth in 2001 as compared to 2000 was approximately 18 when measured in local currency and approximately 14 when measured on a us dollar converted basis offsetting the increase in assessments were rebates and incentives provided to customers which increased 54 million in the year ended december 31 2001 over the same period in 2000   while the events of september 11 2001 did not have a significant impact on mastercard’s total volume they did impact the mix between domestic and international volumes experienced by mastercard international volume decreased dramatically in the weeks following september 11th due to decreased international travel and related expenditures however this decrease was partially offset by higher domestic volume toward the end of the year volumes began to recover which helped drive the overall increase in revenue over the prior year   operating expenses were 1390 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 1267 billion for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 122 million or 10 our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative advertising and market development depreciation and amortization expenses   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel telecommunications data processing travel and professional fees general and administrative expenses were 814 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 737 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 77 million or 10 this increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs resulting from increases in additional personnel and compensation   for the year ended december 31 2001 mastercard made significant investments in advertising and market development to support and build value in the mastercard family of brands and to develop new and distinct programs to differentiate ourselves from our competition advertising and market development expenses were 506 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 471 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 35 million or 7 our promotions and sponsorship fees increased between the periods primarily as a result of incremental promotions in the year ended december 31 2001 such as the national hockey league celebrity cup faceoff as well as increased contractual sponsorship fees associated with the fifa world cup copa america national hockey league major league baseball and pga golf organizations these increases were partially offset by reductions in media expenditures between the periods in traditional television venues and the internet   depreciation expense was 40 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 35 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 5 million or 14 primarily due to purchases of equipment in 2001   amortization expense was 30 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 25 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of approximately 6 million or 23 this increase was primarily the result of additional amortization of capitalized computer software partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of franchise rights in 2001 due to the writedown of mondex franchise rights in certain asian countries to their estimated fair value in 2000   other income expense was 11 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 22 million for the year ended december 31 2000 a decrease of 11 million or 49 other income expense comprises primarily interest dividend and other investment income related to the portfolio of investments held as well as interest expense minority interest and other expense the decrease in other income expense was primarily the result of a devaluation of the trading securities portfolio 29   the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2001 decreased to 390 from 410 for the year ended december 31 2000 the lower rate for the year ended december 31 2001 was primarily due to the utilization for income tax purposes of a loss related to foreign operations the apportionment of pretax income to states with a lower tax rate and a larger amount of taxexempt interest income as a percentage of pretax income than in the year ended december 31 2000   as a result of the foregoing our net income was 142 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 118 million for the year ended december 31 2000 an increase of 24 million or 20 liquidity and capital resources   we need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development to cover any settlement risk to finance our capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and other contractual commitments at december 31 2002 we had 841 million of liquid investments with which to manage operations we expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital and capital needs in 2003 in addition we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of mastercard in 2003   for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash provided by operating activities was 306 million compared to 196 million and 260 million for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december 31 2002 was principally due to changes in settlement due to and from members our accrued expenses and accounts payable increased for the year ended december 31 2002 due to increased spending for advertising and our focus on working capital management   net cash used in investing activities was 112 million 219 million and 322 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the outlay of cash in 2002 was primarily due to capital expenditures expenditures for capitalized software and purchases of investment securities availableforsale capital expenditures were predominantly associated with investments in data center equipment investment securities availableforsale increased as a result of investments made with excess funds those uses were offset by 31 million of cash received net of acquisitionrelated expenses from the acquisition of mastercard europe during the second quarter of 2002   net cash used in provided by financing activities for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 was 35 million 5 million and 6 million respectively in all years financing activities relate to repayments advances of mastercard’s net settlement overdraft positions see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included herein   our financial position continues to reflect strong liquidity working capital consisting of current assets less current liabilities was 526 million at december 31 2002 and 468 million at december 31 2001 representing a working capital ratio of 16 and 17 in 2002 and 2001 respectively   in addition to our liquid investments we provide for liquidity through a 364day revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with certain financial institutions that expires on june 3 2003 under the terms of the credit facility mastercard has commitments of 12 billion that can be borrowed in the form of revolving loans interest is charged at the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 28 basis points and the rate increases depending upon the amount of any draw down under the credit facility mastercard has agreed to pay a facility fee equal to 7 basis points per annum on each lender’s commitment see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 30   we have entered into contractual commitments associated with operating lease agreements for office space and equipment as well as for sponsorship licensing and other agreements obligations relating to these contractual commitments are estimated to be payable in the following periods    in the normal course of business mastercard operates systems for clearing and settling payment transactions among its members net settlements are generally cleared daily among members by wire transfer or other bank clearing means via settlement cash accounts however some transactions may not settle until subsequent business days due to varying local currency settlement value date intervals and other timing differences these timing differences result in amounts from members or amounts due to members for a duration normally ranging from one to four calendar days and are included in the balance sheet of mastercard as settlement due todue from members the net impact of the settled transactions was the main contributor to the net settlement cash account overdraft position of 10 million at december 31 2001 which was recorded in other current liabilities no overdraft positions existed at december 31 2002   primarily due to uncertainty surrounding lawsuits in particular the merchant antitrust litigation described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included herein on june 17 2002 standard  poor’s placed mastercard on negative outlook however standard  poor’s reaffirmed mastercard’s credit rating on september 4 2002   the adverse outcome of certain of the legal proceedings described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included herein could have a detrimental impact on liquidity and capital resources if they result in adverse awards of damages to the relevant plaintiffs   overall we believe our cash provided by operating activities our liquid investments and the credit facility provide sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing business requirements economic fluctuations   although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations we do not believe our operations have been significantly affected by inflation for the most part we have utilized technology and operating efficiencies to offset increased operating expenses in addition a portion of our revenues is based upon a percentage of gdv which partially insulates operating margins on these revenues from the effects of inflation   portions of our business can be seasonal revenue is generally favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period member relationships and related parties   we have a diversified member base of approximately 2300 principal members and approximately 23000 affiliate members our stockholders are all principal members of mastercard international in the normal course of business we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of mastercard international these members do not 31 constitute related parties pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 57 “related party disclosures” 

  certain of our members generate in excess of five percent of our revenue the loss of any of these members could adversely impact mastercard’s net income in addition as part of our business initiative to increase our share mastercard among other efforts enters into business agreements with members these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances under certain circumstances we may be required to permit members in the united states that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the current antitrust litigation being brought against us by the us department of justice any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition however we believe that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows critical accounting policies  estimates   our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgment 

 

   certain revenues are estimated based upon transactional information accumulated from our systems and using historical performance   we have business agreements with certain members that provide for fee rebates when the customers meet certain hurdles such rebates are generally calculated on a monthly basis based upon the estimated customer’s performance and the contracted discount rates for the services provided and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned   in addition we enter into agreements with certain customers to provide volumebased and support incentives that are recorded as a reduction of revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” “eitf 019” incentives are based on management’s estimate of the customer’s performance in a given period   our estimate of customers’ performance is a critical component in the calculation of rebates and incentives customers’ performance is estimated by using historical performance discussions with our customers and transactional information accumulated from our systems the estimated performance is used to calculate the rebates and incentives based upon the related customer agreements actual results may differ from these estimates 

 

   our capitalized software which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use is capitalized in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with statement of position 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” and related guidance development costs are expensed during the preliminary project management phase until it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended thereafter all qualifying direct internal and external costs related to the 32 design development and testing phase are capitalized and upon the project being substantially complete and ready for its intended use are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the software not to exceed three years costs related to postimplementation activities for software that is developed or obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred 

  we are required to make judgments to determine the feasibility of the project for its intended use and the phase of the projects in addition we estimate the internal costs based on hours spent on the design development and testing phases of the project these judgments and estimates impact the accounting for capitalized software in our financial statements 

 

   we test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” and test property plant and equipment for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we test equity investments for a loss in value which is other than temporary in accordance with accounting principles board no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” whenever indicators of impairment exist these assets are tested goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually   our test for impairment requires management to make assumptions regarding the expected net future cash flows of each asset these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts if the sum of expected net future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is recognized the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows or other methodologies   goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our balance sheet therefore an impairment could result in a material reduction of our assets as well as our net income 

 

   we are a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business except as described in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included herein mastercard does not believe that any legal proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects   in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we accrue legal costs that are expected to be incurred to defend mastercard relating to certain litigation the accrual is estimated based on management’s expectations of foreseeable costs as determined in consultation with outside counsel our policy has been applied since the commencement of certain litigation changes in the estimated amount or timing of legal costs can significantly impact our results of operations   outside of foreseeable legal costs we believe that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact if any that the ultimate resolution of legal proceedings will have in our results of operations financial position or cash flows and as such consistent with sfas no 5 no accrual has been made recent accounting pronouncements   in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” “sfas 141” sfas 141 supersedes accounting principles board opinion “apb” no 16 “business combinations” and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june 30 2001 sfas 141 specifies criteria for the recognition of certain intangible assets apart from goodwill the acquisition of epi as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein was accounted for in accordance with sfas 141   in june 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” sfas 142 supersedes apb no 17 “intangible assets” and 33 primarily addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition sfas 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 and was adopted by the company on january 1 2002 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized and must be tested for impairment at least annually sfas 142 further requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed periodically for impairment the statement requires that transitional goodwill goodwill recorded before the adoption of sfas no 142 be tested for impairment within six months of adoption of sfas 142 accordingly mastercard tested the goodwill on its books prior to the acquisition of epi and no impairment was required the goodwill and intangible assets that resulted from the acquisition of epi was accounted for in accordance with sfas 142 the company evaluated goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets recorded in connection with the epi acquisition as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2002 as part of its annual impairment analysis the adoption of sfas 142 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

  in august 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” sfas 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and supercedes fasb statement no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” sfas 144 also supersedes certain aspects of apb no 30 “reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as required by apb no 30 the company adopted sfas 144 on january 1 2002 the adoption of sfas 144 did not have an impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations   in february 2002 the eitf finalized issue no 019 “accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor’s products” eitf 019 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 and provides guidance on the income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a customer in connection with the customer’s purchase of the vendor’s products or to promote sales of the vendor’s products on january 1 2002 mastercard implemented eitf 019 which resulted in certain payments to customers and merchants previously classified as advertising and market development expense being reclassified as a reduction of revenue the amounts of such consideration were 167 million and 127 million for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively incentives are based on management’s estimate of the customer’s performance as detailed in the agreements in a given period and actual results may differ from these estimates   in june 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” “sfas 146” sfas 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan costs associated with exit or disposal activities for entities newly acquired in a business combination are not within the scope of sfas 146 the provisions of sfas 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 with early application encouraged the company early adopted sfas 146 on july 1 2002 the adoption of sfas 146 did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations   in november 2002 the eitf concluded on issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” “eitf 0021” eitf 0021 addresses how to determine when a revenue arrangement for multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and if separation is appropriate how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units the provisions of eitf 0021 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 mastercard is in the process of determining the impact if any of adopting this accounting pronouncement 34   in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” “fin 45” fin 45 requires that upon the issuance of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee fin 45’s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 irrespective of the guarantor’s fiscal year end the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december 15 2002 mastercard has complied with the disclosure requirements and is in the process of determining the impact if any of adopting the provisions for initial recognition and measurement for guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002   in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” fin 46 clarifies that companies may need to consolidate certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 fin 46 is applicable in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 the impact of consolidating the special purpose entity is discussed in detail in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we have limited exposure to market risk from changes in both interest rates and foreign exchange rates management establishes and oversees the implementation of board of director approved policies governing our funding investments and use of derivative financial instruments and we monitor aggregate risk exposures on an ongoing basis   we enter into forward currency contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies this activity minimizes our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the us dollar and euro as a result of the acquisition of mastercard europe mastercard’s market risk exposures at december 31 2002 are greater than december 31 2001   at december 31 2002 and 2001 forward currency contracts against the dollar were both sold with notional amounts of 25 million and 3 million respectively and purchased with notional amounts of 39 million and 11 million respectively based on the yearend 2002 and 2001 foreign exchange positions the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at 13 million and 07 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively   in 2002 due to the acquisition of mastercard europe forward currency contracts against the euro were both sold with notional amounts of 8 million and purchased with notional amounts of 199 million a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at 17 million at december 31 2002 the terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 12 months and are utilized to manage anticipated cash flows in major overseas markets for the subsequent year   our settlement activities may be subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations this risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rate for financial transactions and the clearing of settlement positions is typically one business day and is limited to seventeen stable transaction currencies the remaining 145 transaction currencies are settled in us dollars or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure   our interest sensitive assets are our debt instruments which we hold as investments they are rated aa or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and mediumterm notes with respect to fixed maturities our general policy is to invest in high quality securities while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure based on the net present value of expected future cash flows a 35 100 basis point increase in interest rates assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of 15 million and 14 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  we own trading securities which are comprised of equity securities held in connection with an executive compensation plan the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of 3 million and 4 million for december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively these securities are part of a deferred executive compensation plan therefore an offsetting gain of 2 million and 3 million for december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively would be recorded in general and administrative expense   at december 31 2002 and 2001 we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures settlement service operations and other operational needs these credit facilities have variable rates which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included herein 36
