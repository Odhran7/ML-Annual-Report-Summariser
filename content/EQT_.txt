 item 1 business 

general 

we are a natural gas production company with operations focused in the marcellus and utica shales of the appalachian basin based on average daily sales volume we are the largest producer of natural gas in the united states as of december 31 2021 we had 250 tcfe of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves across approximately 20 million gross acres including approximately 17 million gross acres in the marcellus play 

strategy 

we are committed to responsibly developing our worldclass asset base and being the operator of choice for all stakeholders by promoting a culture that prioritizes operational efficiency technology and sustainability we seek to continuously improve the way we produce environmentally responsible reliable lowcost energy we measure sustainability through our bestinclass team and culture esgfocused operations substantial inventory of core drilling locations and strong balance sheet we believe that the scale and contiguity of our acreage position differentiates us from our appalachian basin peers and that our evolution into a modern digitallyenabled exploration and production business enhances our strategic advantage 

our operational strategy focuses on the successful execution of combodevelopment projects combodevelopment refers to the development of several multiwell pads in tandem combodevelopment generates value across all levels of the reserves development process by maximizing operational and capital efficiencies in the drilling stage rigs spend more time drilling and less time transitioning to new sites advanced planning a prerequisite to pursuing combodevelopment facilitates the delivery of bulk hydraulic fracturing sand and piped fresh water as opposed to trucktransported water the ability to continuously meet completions supply needs and the use of environmentally friendly technologies operational efficiencies realized from combodevelopment are passed on to our service providers which reduces overall contract rates 

the benefits of combodevelopment extend beyond financial gains to include environmental and social interests we have developed an integrated esg program that interplays with our combodevelopmentdriven operational strategy core tenets of our esg program include investing in technology and human capital improving data collection analysis and reporting and engaging with stakeholders to understand and align our actions with their needs and expectations combodevelopment when compared to similar production from noncombodevelopment operations translates into fewer trucks on the road decreased fuel usage shorter periods of noise pollution fewer areas impacted by midstream pipeline construction and shortened duration of site operations all of which fosters a greater focus on safety and environmental protection 

combodevelopment projects require significant advanced planning including the establishment of a large contiguous leasehold position the advanced acquisition of regulatory permits and sourcing of fracturing sand and water the timely verification of midstream connectivity and the ability to quickly respond to internal and external stimuli without a modern digitallyconnected operating model or an acreage position that enables operations of this scale combodevelopment would not be possible 

we believe that our proprietary digital work environment in conjunction with the size and contiguity of our asset base uniquely position us to execute on a multiyear inventory of combodevelopment projects in our core acreage position our operational strategy employs this differentiation to advance our mission of being the operator of choice for all stakeholders we believe that combodevelopment projects are key to delivering sustainably low well costs and higher returns on invested capital and that our longterm transformative plan has been designed to create value by leveraging our strategic advantage both operational and environmental over our peers 

we believe our business model is sustainable and we expect to generate significant free cash flow over the next six years our capital allocation plan is focused on reducing our debt and leverage while also returning capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and a share repurchase program we are focused on achieving and maintaining investment grade credit metrics as well as regaining our investment grade credit rating in the near term which will allow us to capture a lower cost of capital and enhance shareholder returns 

2021 highlights 

• achieved 2021 sales volume of 1858 bcfe average daily sales volume of 51 bcfe per day received an average realized price of 250 per mcfe 

• increased 2021 total proved reserves by 52 tcfe or 26 compared to 2020 

• acquired strategic assets located in the appalachian basin from alta resources development llc for total consideration of 2925 million the alta acquisition 

• realized a meaningful reduction of gathering and transmission expense on a per mcfe basis of 005 and 006 respectively during 2021 compared to 2020 

• achieved credit ratings upgrades from sp moodys and fitch 

• extended the term of our credit facility and reduced outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility by 351 million 

• obtained equitable origin and miq certifications for a majority of our natural gas 

outlook 

in 2022 we expect to spend approximately 130 to 145 billion in total capital expenditures excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest we expect to allocate the planned capital expenditures as follows approximately 10 to 11 billion to fund reserve development approximately 110 to 130 million to fund land and lease acquisitions approximately 120 to 160 million to fund other production infrastructure and approximately 55 to 75 million applied towards capitalized overhead our 2022 capital expenditure program is expected to deliver sales volume of 1950 to 2050 bcfe 

in december 2021 we reaffirmed our commitment to attaining investment grade credit metrics and outlined a leverage and debt reduction strategy with the goal of reducing total debt by at least 15 billion by the end of 2023 in addition we announced our plan to return capital to shareholders which included the commencement of a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase 10 billion of our outstanding common stock and the reinstatement of a quarterly cash dividend at an annual rate of 050 per share of our common stock starting in the first quarter of 2022 our capital allocation plan is focused on maintaining production volumes we have aligned our hedge strategy in a manner that we believe will mitigate the risk of volatility of future natural gas and ngls prices which will enable us to execute on our capital expenditure debt reduction and shareholder return strategy 

our revenues earnings liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices we receive for and our ability to develop our reserves of natural gas ngls and oil due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil at our ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations changes in natural gas ngls and oil prices could affect among other things our development plans which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of our reserves as well as our revenues earnings or liquidity lower prices and changes in our development plans could also result in noncash impairments in the book value of our oil and gas properties or downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves any such impairments or downward adjustments to our estimated reserves could potentially be material to us 

see impairment of oil and gas properties and critical accounting policies and estimates included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant assumptions related to accounting for gas ngls and oil producing activities and our accounting policies and processes related to impairment reviews for proved and unproved property 

segment and geographical information 

our operations consist of one reportable segment we have a single companywide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an areabyarea basis substantially all of our assets and operations are located in the appalachian basin 

reserves 

  

the following tables summarize our proved developed and undeveloped natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months and disaggregated by product and play substantially all of our reserves reside in continuous accumulations 





the following table summarizes our proved developed and undeveloped reserves using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months and disaggregated by state 



our 2021 total proved reserves increased by 52 tcfe or 26 compared to 2020 due to acquisitions of 4187 bcfe from the alta acquisition and reliance asset acquisition defined in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and extensions discoveries and other additions of 3104 bcfe partly offset by production of 1858 bcfe and revisions to previous estimates of 274 bcfe 

our 2021 proved undeveloped reserves increased by 1582 bcfe or 26 compared to 2020 the following table provides a rollforward of our proved undeveloped reserves 



a composed of i negative revisions of 819 bcfe from proved undeveloped locations that are no longer expected to be developed within five years of initial booking as proved reserves as a result of changes to our development plan to support the continued implementation of our combodevelopment strategy and ii negative revisions of 62 bcfe due primarily to changes in working interests and net revenue interests 

b composed of i 2828 bcfe from proved undeveloped additions associated with acreage that was previously unproved but became proved due to 2021 reserve development that expanded the number of our proven locations implementation of and alignment with our combodevelopment strategy and additions to our fiveyear drilling plan and ii 52 bcfe from the extension of lateral lengths of proved undeveloped reserves 

as of december 31 2021 we had zero wells with proved undeveloped reserves that had remained undeveloped for more than five years from their time of booking 

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the preparation of and yearoveryear changes in our reserves estimate and calculation of the standardized measure of estimated future net cash flows from natural gas and crude oil reserves 

as of december 31 2021 the standardized measure of our estimated future net cash flows from natural gas and crude oil reserves which is calculated using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months referred to as sec pricing was 17281 million as described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements if the prices used in the calculation of the standardized measure instead reflected fiveyear strip pricing as of december 31 2021 and held constant thereafter using i the nymex fiveyear strip adjusted for regional differentials using texas eastern transmission corp m2 transcontinental gas pipe line leidy line and tennessee gas pipeline co zone 4300 leg for gas and ii the nymex wti fiveyear strip for oil adjusted for regional differentials consistent with those used in the standardized measure and holding all other assumptions constant our total proved reserves would be 24913 bcfe the standardized measure of our discounted net future cash flows after taxes of our proved reserves would be 16059 million and the discounted future net cash flows before taxes would be 19672 million the average realized product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties would be 4684 per barrel of oil 2722 per barrel of ngls and 2448 per mcf of gas compared to 5157 per barrel of oil 2995 per barrel of ngls and 2694 per mcf of gas using sec pricing as described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

the nymex strip price proved reserves and related metrics are intended to illustrate reserve sensitivities to market expectations of commodity prices and should not be confused with sec pricing proved reserves and do not comply with sec pricing assumptions we believe that the presentation of reserve volume and related metrics using nymex forward strip prices provides investors with additional useful information about our reserves because the forward prices are based on the markets forwardlooking expectations of oil and gas prices as of a certain date the price at which we can sell our production in the future is the major determinant of the likely economic producibility of our reserves we hedge certain amounts of future production based on futures prices in addition we use such forwardlooking marketbased data in developing our drilling plans assessing our capital expenditure needs and projecting future cash flows while nymex strip prices represent a consensus estimate of future pricing such prices are only an estimate and not necessarily an accurate projection of future oil and gas prices actual future prices may vary significantly from the nymex prices therefore actual revenue and value generated may be more or less than the amounts disclosed investors should be careful to consider forward prices in addition to and not as a substitute for sec pricing when considering our reserves 

based on our mix of proved undeveloped and probable reserves we estimate that we have an undeveloped drilling inventory of approximately 2400 net locations in the pennsylvania and west virginia marcellus shale at our current drilling pace these net locations provide more than 20 years of drilling inventory based on net undeveloped marcellus acres average expected lateral length of 12000 feet and well spacing of 1000 feet we believe that our combodevelopment strategy coupled with our undeveloped inventory located in a premier core asset base will lead to sustainable free cash flow generation and higher returns on invested capital 

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures for reserve development 



  

for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 lease operating costs excluding production taxes were 007 007 and 006 respectively 

properties 

the majority of our acreage is held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles approximately 28 of our total gross acres is developed we retain deep drilling rights on the majority of our acreage 

the following table summarizes our acreage disaggregated by state 



a as of december 31 2021 the average net revenue interest of proved developed reserves was 309 for northeastern pennsylvania and 790 for southwestern pennsylvania 

we have an active lease renewal program in areas targeted for development in the event that production is not established or we do not extend or renew the terms of our expiring leases 57361 36799 and 31123 of our net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2021 will expire in the years ending december 31 2022 2023 and 2024 respectively 

the following tables summarize our productive and inprocess natural gas wells we had no productive or inprocess oil wells as of december 31 2021 





a of our total gross productive wells there are 610 gross conventional wells in pennsylvania and 3 gross conventional wells in west virginia we have no gross conventional wells in ohio 

we drilled 99 120 and 145 net productive development wells during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we drilled zero net dry development net productive exploratory and net dry exploratory wells 

during 2021 we commenced drilling operations spud on 96 gross wells 67 net composed of 50 pennsylvania marcellus gross wells 34 net 41 west virginia marcellus gross wells 32 net and 5 ohio utica gross wells 1 net 

our sales volume in 2021 from the marcellus shale was 1685 bcfe the following table summarizes our produced and sold volume by state 



markets and customers 

natural gas sales natural gas is a commodity and therefore we typically receive marketbased pricing for our produced natural gas the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin is typically lower relative to nymex henry hub louisiana the location for pricing nymex natural gas futures as a result of increased supply of natural gas in the northeast united states to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices we hedge a portion of our forecasted natural gas production at for the most part nymex natural gas prices we also enter into derivative instruments to hedge basis for information on our hedging strategy and our derivative instruments refer to commodity risk management in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

ngls sales we primarily sell ngls recovered from our natural gas production we primarily contract with markwest energy partners lp markwest to process our natural gas and extract from the produced natural gas heavier hydrocarbon streams consisting predominately of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline we also contract with markwest to market a portion of our ngls in addition we have contractual arrangements with williams ohio valley midstream llc to process our natural gas and market a portion of our ngls 

  

average sales price the following table presents our average sales price per unit of natural gas ngls and oil with and without the effects of cash settled derivatives as applicable 



for additional information on pricing see average realized price reconciliation in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas marketing eqt energy llc our indirect whollyowned marketing subsidiary provides marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management services primarily for our benefit eqt energy llc also engages in risk management and hedging activities to limit our exposure to shifts in market prices 

customers we sell natural gas and ngls to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets that are accessible through our transportation portfolio particularly where there is expected future demand growth such as in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states and canada as of december 31 2021 approximately 50 of our sales volume reaches markets outside of appalachia we do not depend on any single customer and believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas ngls and oil 

we have access to approximately 30 bcf per day of firm pipeline takeaway capacity and 09 bcf per day of firm processing capacity in addition we are committed to an initial 129 bcf per day of firm capacity on the mountain valley pipeline upon its inservice date these firm transportation and processing agreements may require minimum volume delivery commitments which we expect to principally fulfill with production from existing reserves 

during 2021 we entered into a longterm asset management agreement with an investment grade entity pursuant to which we agreed to deliver and sell up to 525000 dth of natural gas per day to the investment grade entity for a period of up to six years while managing and using our committed capacity on the mountain valley pipeline upon its inservice date the asset management agreement is subject to currently unsatisfied conditions therefore its impacts have been excluded from the schedule of total gross commitments summarized in the table below 

we have contractually agreed to deliver firm quantities of gas and ngls to various customers which we expect to fulfill with production from existing reserves we regularly monitor our proved developed reserves to ensure sufficient availability to meet commitments for the next one to three years the following table summarizes our total gross commitments as of december 31 2021 



seasonality 

generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or summers may also impact demand 

competition 

  

other natural gas producers compete with us in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and ngls and the securing of services labor equipment and transportation required to conduct operations our competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies individual producers operators and marketing companies and other energy companies that produce substitutes for the commodities that we produce 

regulation 

  

regulation of our operations our exploration and production operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the following the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas resources 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the following regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties ohio and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia we must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus acreage in pennsylvania lease integration legislation authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas various states also impose certain regulatory requirements to transfer wells to third parties or discontinue operations in the event of divestitures by us 

we maintain limited gathering operations that are subject to various federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including the following air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations including regulations by the department of transportations pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

in 2010 congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation among other things the doddfrank act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivative activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act have yet to be adopted regulators have issued numerous rules under the doddfrank act including a rule establishing an enduser exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule requiring the posting of margin for certain uncleared swaps margin rule and a rule imposing federal position limits on certain futures contracts relating to energy products including natural gas position limits rule 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for such exception as a result our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing although we are subject to certain recordkeeping and reporting obligations associated with such rule we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe that the majority if not all of our hedging activities constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and are not materially impacted by the limitations under such rule however many of our hedge counterparties and other market participants are not eligible for the enduser exception are subject to mandatory clearing and the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties and may be subject to the position limits rule which may affect the pricing andor availability of derivatives for us in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

regulators periodically review or audit our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements we anticipate that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on us 

the following is a summary of some of the existing laws rules and regulations to which our business operations are subject 

natural gas sales and transportation the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by the ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation the fercs regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transportation in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production the ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties of over 13 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation while our production activities have not been regulated by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga we are required to report aggregate volume of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions use contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices in addition congress may enact legislation or the ferc may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise nonferc jurisdictional facilities to further regulation failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalties 

the cftc also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical futures and other derivatives with respect to energy commodities markets including natural gas ngls and oil with regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake we are thus required to observe antimarket manipulation and disruptive trading practices laws and related regulations enforced by the cftc the cftc also holds substantial enforcement authority including the ability to assess civil penalties 

the ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 the ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nonunduly discriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company the fercs initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gasrelated activities 

under the fercs current regulatory regime transportation services must be provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates both of which are subject to ferc approval the ferc also allows jurisdictional natural gas pipeline companies to charge marketbased rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive gathering service which occurs upstream of fercjurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters section 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga although the ferc has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a nonjurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function the fercs determinations as to the classification of facilities are done on a casebycase basis to the extent that the ferc issues an order that reclassifies certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities and depending on the scope of that decision our costs of transporting natural gas to point of sale locations may increase we believe that the thirdparty natural gas pipelines on which our gas is gathered meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company however the distinction between the fercregulated transportation services and federally unregulated gathering services could be subject to potential litigation so the classification and regulation of those gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatorytake requirements although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 

oil and ngls price controls and transportation rates sales prices of oil and ngls are not currently regulated and are made at market prices our sales of these commodities are however subject to laws and regulations issued by the federal trade commission ftc prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market the ftc holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations including the ability to assess civil penalties of over 12 million per day per violation our sales of these commodities and any related hedging activities are also subject to cftc oversight and enforcement authority as discussed above 

the price we receive from the sale of our produced oil and ngls may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market some of our transportation of oil and ngls is through fercregulated interstate common carrier pipelines effective as of january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations the fercs regulation of crude oil and ngls transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipelines although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry the fercs fiveyear index level for 2021–2026 went into effect on july 1 2021 in january 2022 the ferc issued an order on rehearing lowering the index level and directing oil pipelines to recompute their ceiling levels for july 1 2021 through june 30 2022 to ensure compliance with the new index level 

environmental health and safety regulation our business operations are also subject to numerous stringent federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of certain materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment we must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing operating and plugging and abandoning wells and related facilities violations of these laws can result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties these laws and regulations may require us to acquire permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands and other protected areas or areas with endangered or threatened species restrictions require some form of remedial action to prevent remediate or mitigate pollution from operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production 

moreover the trend has been for stricter regulation of activities that have the potential to affect the environment additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by congress federal agencies the states local governments and the courts we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective therefore we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance the regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability we have established procedures however for the ongoing evaluation of our operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to track compliance with regulatory policies and procedures 

the following is a summary of the more significant environmental and occupational health and workplace safety laws and regulations as amended from time to time to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition earnings or cash flows 

hazardous substances and waste handling the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment these persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in addition despite the petroleum exclusion of section 10114 of cercla which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances based on their characteristics however we are unaware of any liabilities arising under cercla for which we may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect us 

the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws establish detailed requirements for the generation handling storage treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes rcra specifically excludes drilling fluids produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes however these wastes may be regulated by the epa or state agencies under rcras less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions or under state laws or other federal laws moreover it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future in april 2019 following litigation and a resulting consent decree related to the epas requirements under rcra to review oil and gas waste regulations the epa determined that revisions to the regulations were not required concluding that any adverse effects related to oil and gas waste were more appropriately and readily addressed within the framework of existing state regulatory programs any changes to state or federal programs could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose waste which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we currently own lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for many years although we believe that we have used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on under or from other locations including offsite locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal in addition some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control we are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act or have acted as operator the failure of a prior owner or operator to comply with applicable environmental regulations may in certain circumstances be attributed to us as current owner or operator under cercla these properties and the substances disposed or released on under or from them may be subject to cercla rcra and analogous state laws under such laws we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures regardless of fault which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or waste pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 

water discharges the federal water pollution control act known as the clean water act cwa and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes into federal and state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or a state equivalent agency the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters including wetlands is also prohibited unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers corps in june 2015 the epa and the corps issued a rule defining the scope of the epas and the corps jurisdiction over waters of the united states wotus which never took effect before being replaced by the navigable waters protection rule nwpr in december 2019 a coalition of states and cities environmental groups and agricultural groups challenged the nwpr which was vacated by a federal district court in august 2021 the epa is undergoing a rulemaking process to redefine the definition of waters of the united states in the interim the epa is using the pre2015 definition in addition in an april 2020 decision further defining the scope of the cwa the us supreme court held that in certain cases discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the cwa and require a permit the court rejected the epa and corps assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the cwa to the extent a new rule or further litigation expands the scope of the cwas jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas which could delay the development of our natural gas and oil projects also pursuant to these laws and regulations we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or stormwater and to develop and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc plans in connection with onsite storage of significant quantities of oil these laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal remediation and natural resource and other damages 

air emissions through the federal clean air act caa and comparable state and local laws and regulations the epa regulates emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements the epa has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin and modified and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits 

in june 2016 the epa finalized regulations establishing new source performance standards nsps known as subpart ooooa for methane and volatile organic compounds voc from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities in september 2020 the epa finalized two sets of amendments to the 2016 subpart ooooa standards the first known as the 2020 technical rule reduced the 2016 rules fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expanded exceptions to pneumatic pump requirements among other changes the second known as the 2020 policy rule rescinded the methanespecific requirements for certain oil and natural gas sources in the production and processing segments on january 20 2021 president biden issued an executive order directing the epa to rescind the 2020 technical rule by september 2021 and consider revising the 2020 policy rule on june 30 2021 president biden signed a congressional review act cra resolution passed by congress that revoked the 2020 policy rule the cra did not address the 2020 technical rule 

further on november 15 2021 the epa issued a proposed rule intended to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas sources the proposed rule would make the existing regulations in subpart ooooa more stringent and create a subpart oooob to expand reduction requirements for new modified and reconstructed oil and gas sources including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the caa including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers and associated gas and liquids unloading facilities in addition the proposed rule would establish emissions guidelines creating a subpart ooooc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the epa under the proposed rule states would have three years to develop their compliance plan for existing sources and the regulations for new sources would take effect immediately upon issuance of a final rule the epa is expected to issue both a supplemental proposed rule which may expand or modify the current proposed rule and final rule by the end of 2022 

as a result of these regulatory changes the scope of any final methane regulations or the costs for complying with federal methane regulations are uncertain we may incur costs as necessary to remain in compliance with these regulations obtaining or renewing permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties and seek injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations 

climate change and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in december 2015 the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change resulted in nearly 200 countries including the united states coming together to develop the paris agreement which calls for the signatories to the agreement to undertake ambitious efforts to limit increases in the average global temperature although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their greenhouse gas ghg emissions it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the us would withdraw from the paris agreement and completed the process of withdrawing from the paris agreement on november 4 2020 however on january 20 2021 president biden issued written notification to the united nations of the uss intention to rejoin the paris agreement which became effective on february 19 2021 in addition in september 2021 president biden publicly announced the global methane pledge a pact that aims to reduce global methane emissions to at least 30 below 2020 levels by 2030 since its formal launch at the united nations climate change conference cop26 over 100 countries have joined the pledge 

on november 3 2021 the us house of representatives passed budget reconciliation bill hr 5376 known as the build back better act the house version of the bill includes a provision targeting methane emissions from oil and gas sources by proposing to implement fees for excess methane leaking from wells storage sites and pipelines as well as fees for new producing and nonproducing oil and gas leases and offshore pipelines it is unclear whether the build back better act will be passed in its current form by the us senate 

additionally a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of capandtrade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting ghgs in october 2019 pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed an executive order directing the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep to draft regulations establishing a capandtrade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions with the intent of enabling pennsylvania to join the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi a multistate regional capandtrade program comprised of several eastern us states in september 2020 the pennsylvania environmental quality board eqb approved promulgation of the rggi regulation and a public comment period and hearings regarding the regulation commenced at the end of 2020 in september 2021 pennsylvanias independent regulatory review commission adopted a regulation approving pennsylvanias participation in rggi however in october 2021 the pennsylvania senate approved a resolution to block the states participation in rggi and such resolution was subsequently approved by the pennsylvania house in december 2021 on january 10 2022 governor wolf vetoed the senates resolution and as a result it is likely that pennsylvania will join rggi in 2022 unless the pennsylvania legislature overrides the governors veto by the vote of twothirds of the members of each of the pennsylvania house and senate in the event that pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of rggi it will result in increased operating costs if we are required to purchase emission allowances in connection with our operations 

any legislation or regulatory programs at the federal state or city levels designed to reduce ghg emissions could increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for the natural gas ngls and oil we produce consequently legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of ghgs could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or imposing a tax or fee or otherwise limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to comply with such regulations substantial limitations or fees on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the natural gas ngls and oil we produce and lower the value of our reserves 

notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change the international energy agency estimates that natural gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades nonetheless recent activism directed at shifting funding away from fossil fuel companies could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations 

hydraulic fracturing activities vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in our industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers our well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations we conduct multiple predrill samplings for all water sources within 3000 feet of our sites and postdrill samplings for sources within 1500 feet of our sites 

hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act sdwa over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and has prohibited the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities for example in january 2020 the eqb approved a well permit fee increase from 5000 to 12500 for all unconventional wells local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells 

occupational safety and health act we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osh act and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees in addition the occupational health and safety administrations osha hazard communication standard the emergency planning and community right to know act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require us to maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens 

endangered species act and migratory bird treaty act the federal endangered species act esa provides for the protection of endangered and threatened species pursuant to the esa if a species is listed as threatened or endangered restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species habitat the us fish and wildlife service fws may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species in august 2019 the fws and national marine fisheries service nmfs issued three rules amending implementation of the esa regulations revising among other things the process for listing species and designating critical habitat a coalition of states and environmental groups have challenged the three rules and litigation remains pending in addition in december 2020 the fws amended its regulations governing critical habitat designations the amended regulations are subject to ongoing litigation in june 2021 the fws and the nmfs announced plans to begin rulemaking processes to rescind these rules protections similar to the esa are offered to migratory birds under the migratory bird treaty act mbta which makes it illegal to among other things hunt capture kill possess sell or purchase migratory birds nests or eggs without a permit this prohibition covers most bird species in the us in january 2021 the department of the interior finalized a rule limiting application of the mbta however the department of the interior revoked the rule in october 2021 and issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the departments plan to develop regulations that authorize incidental taking under certain prescribed conditions future implementation of the rules implementing the esa and the mbta are uncertain a critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit access to protected areas for natural gas development further the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks associated with natural gas drilling operations 

drilling for and producing natural gas is a highrisk and costly activity with many uncertainties our future financial position cash flows and results of operations depend on the success of our development and acquisition activities which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable natural gas production or that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in drilled wells 

many factors may curtail delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects including the following 

• delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including limitations resulting from permitting wastewater disposal discharge of ghgs and limitations on hydraulic fracturing 

• shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment rigs materials qualified personnel or water for hydraulic fracturing activities 

• supply chain disruptions or labor shortage impacts related to the covid19 pandemic or other global pandemics 

• equipment failures accidents or other unexpected operational events 

• lack of available gathering and water facilities or delays in the construction of gathering and water facilities 

• lack of available capacity on interconnecting transportation pipelines 

• adverse weather conditions such as flooding droughts freezeoffs landslides blizzards and ice storms 

• issues related to compliance with environmental regulations 

• environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks oil and diesel spills pipeline and tank ruptures encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized discharges of brine well stimulation and completion fluids toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment 

• declines in natural gas ngls and oil market prices 

• limited availability of financing at acceptable terms 

• ongoing litigation or adverse court rulings 

• public opposition to our operations 

• title surface access coal mining and right of way issues and 

• limitations in the market for natural gas ngls and oil 

any of these risks can cause a delay in our development program or result in substantial financial losses personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells and facilities 

our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to drilling for producing transporting and storing natural gas ngls and oil such as fires explosions slips landslides blowouts and well cratering pipe and other equipment and system failures delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities adverse weather conditions such as freeze offs of wells and pipelines due to cold weather issues related to compliance with environmental regulations environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks oil and diesel spills pipeline and tank ruptures encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized releases of brine well stimulation and completion fluids toxic gases or other pollutants into the environment especially those that reach surface water or groundwater inadvertent thirdparty damage to our assets and natural disasters we also face various risks or threats to the operation and security of our or third parties facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants compressor stations and pipelines any of these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property equipment and natural resources pollution or other environmental damage loss of hydrocarbons disruptions to our operations regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of our operations repair and remediation costs and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage 

as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable and we may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

our drilling locations are scheduled out over many years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of when they are drilled if at all 

our management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain well locations as an estimation of our future multiyear drilling activities on our existing acreage these well locations represent a significant part of our business strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including natural gas ngls and oil prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs the availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations topography gathering system and pipeline transportation costs and constraints access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems coordination with coal mining regulatory approvals and other factors because of these uncertain factors we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas ngls or oil from these or any other drilling locations in addition unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained our leases for such acreage will expire further certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling or unitization with adjacent leaseholds controlled by third parties if these third parties are unwilling to pool or unitize such leaseholds with ours the total locations we can drill may be limited as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified 

failure to timely develop our leased real property could result in increased capital expenditures andor impairment of our leases 

mineral rights are typically owned by individuals who may enter into property leases with us to allow for the development of natural gas such leases expire after an initial term typically five years unless certain actions are taken to preserve the lease if we cannot preserve a lease the lease terminates approximately 10 of our net undeveloped acres are subject to leases that could expire over the next three years lack of access to capital changes in government regulations changes in future development plans or commodity prices reduced drilling activity or the reduction in the fair value of undeveloped properties in the areas in which we operate could impact our ability to preserve trade or sell our leases prior to their expiration resulting in the termination or impairment of leases for properties that we have not developed 

we evaluate capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties at least annually to determine recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in our business strategy and historical experience the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded impairment and expiration of leases of 3118 million 3067 million and 5564 million respectively refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

our inability to cure any title defects in our leases in a timely and costefficient manner may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

the amount and timing of actual future natural gas ngls and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

because the rate of production from natural gas and oil wells and associated ngls generally declines as reserves are depleted our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volume to fall short of our projections our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngls and oil price volatility regulatory approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that perform below expectations or that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit low natural gas ngls and oil prices may further limit the types of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced future natural gas ngls and oil production therefore is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable we cannot be certain that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with efficient operation of existing wells our reserves and production together with associated revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs some of which are beyond our control these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows to the extent we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved although we believe our estimates are reasonable actual production revenues and costs to develop reserves will likely vary from our estimates and these variances could be material numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves 

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelvemonth unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil the amount timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves and thus their actual present value in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our operations or the natural gas ngls and oil industry in general 

natural gas ngls and oil price declines and changes in our development strategy have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including longlived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations because the results are based on estimated future events and estimated future cash flows the estimated future cash flows used to test our proved oil and gas properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by our management for internal planning and budgeting purposes key assumptions used in our analyses include among other things the intended use of the asset the anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil future operating costs inflation and the anticipated proceeds that may be received upon divestiture if there is a possibility that the asset will be divested prior to the end of its useful life commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality locational basis adjustments and inflation proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

future declines in natural gas ngls or oil prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance among other circumstances may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves andor could result in additional noncash impairment charges to writedown the carrying amount of our assets including other longlived intangible assets which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods any impairment of our assets including other longlived intangible assets would require us to take an immediate charge to earnings such charges could be material to our results of operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position see impairment of oil and gas properties in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial and market risks applicable to our business 

natural gas ngls and oil prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control including many of which that are unknown and cannot be anticipated and we cannot predict with certainty future potential movements in the price for these commodities 

our primary business involves the exploration production and sale of hydrocarbons and in particular natural gas consequently our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position depend upon the market prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent ngls and oil the prices for natural gas ngls and oil have historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include 

• weather conditions and seasonal trends 

• the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for natural gas ngls and oil 

• prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices 

• national and worldwide economic and political conditions 

• new and competing exploratory finds of natural gas ngls and oil 

• changes in us exports of natural gas ngls and oil 

• the effect of energy conservation efforts 

• the price availability and consumer demand for alternative fuels 

• the availability proximity capacity and cost of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices 

• technological advances affecting energy consumption and production 

• the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 

• the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets including commodity price speculators and others 

• the cost of exploring for developing producing and transporting natural gas ngls and oil 

• risks associated with drilling completion and production operations and 

• domestic local and foreign governmental regulations tariffs and taxes including environmental and climate change regulation 

the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 2386 per mmbtu to a low of 243 per mmbtu from january 1 2021 through december 31 2021 and the daily spot prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 8564 per barrel to a low of 4747 per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin is typically lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the increased production and supply of natural gas in the northeast united states because our production and reserves predominantly consist of natural gas approximately 94 of our equivalent proved developed reserves changes in natural gas prices have significantly greater impact on our financial results than oil prices ngls are made up of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics which adds further volatility to the pricing of ngls 

we use financial models to attempt to project future prices for the hydrocarbons we produce and sell and we make decisions regarding our production operations and hedging strategy in part based on such modelling however due to the volatility of commodity prices and the multitude of external factors that impact commodity prices many of which are unknown and unforeseeable such as reduced demand as a result of a general economic slowdown related to the covid19 pandemic or other global pandemics we are unable to predict with certainty future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil accordingly the success of our plans and strategies could be negatively affected if our projections of future hydrocarbon prices are significantly different from the ultimate actual price 

natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position 

prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas ngls and oil prices may adversely affect our revenues operating income cash flows and financial position particularly if we are unable to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngls and oil prices declines in prices could also adversely affect our drilling activities and the amount of natural gas ngls and oil that we can produce economically which may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur noncash impairment charges to earnings reductions in cash flows from lower commodity prices may require us to incur additional debt or reduce our capital spending which could reduce our production and our reserves negatively affecting our future rate of growth lower prices for natural gas ngls and oil may also adversely affect our credit ratings and result in a reduction in our borrowing capacity and access to other capital see impairment of oil and gas properties in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

increases in natural gas ngls and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral or letters of credit with our hedge counterparties and would negatively impact our liquidity the cash collateral provided to our hedge counterparties which is interestbearing is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we will not benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in our derivative contracts having a positive fair value in our favor further adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our hedge counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection 

we may not be able to successfully execute our plan to deleverage our business or otherwise reduce our debt level 

in december 2021 we reaffirmed our commitment to attaining investment grade credit metrics and outlined a leverage and debt reduction strategy with the goal of reducing our total debt by 15 billion by the end of 2023 our debt reduction plan we intend to fund our debt reduction plan through free cash flow and have aligned our hedge strategy in a manner that we believe will mitigate the risk of volatility of future natural gas and ngls prices which we anticipate will enable us to execute on our debt reduction plan and other capital allocation strategies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient free cash flow to execute our debt reduction plan on our anticipated timeframe if at all if we are not able to successfully execute our debt reduction plan or otherwise reduce our total debt to a level we believe appropriate our credit ratings may be lowered we may reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or investments and we may revise or delay our shareholder returns strategy or other strategic plans 

our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms 

our business is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the development and acquisition of natural gas ngls and oil reserves we typically fund our capital expenditures with existing cash and cash generated by operations and to the extent our capital expenditures exceed our cash resources from borrowings under our credit facility and other external sources of capital if we do not have sufficient borrowing availability under our credit facility we may seek alternate debt or equity financing sell assets or reduce our capital expenditures the issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of among other things natural gas prices actual drilling results the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory technological and competitive developments 

our cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

• our level of proved reserves and production 

• the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells 

• our access to and the cost of accessing end markets for our production 

• the prices at which our production is sold 

• our ability to acquire locate and produce new reserves 

• the levels of our operating expenses and 

• our ability to access the public or private capital markets or borrow under our credit facility 

if our cash flows from operations or the borrowing capacity under our credit facility are insufficient to fund our capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain the capital necessary for our planned capital budget or our operations we could be required to curtail our operations and the development of our properties which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

as of december 31 2021 our senior notes were rated ba1 with a stable outlook by moodys investors services moodys bb with a positive outlook by standard  poors ratings service sp and bb with a stable outlook by fitch ratings service fitch although we are not aware of any current plans of moodys sp or fitch to downgrade its rating of our senior notes we cannot be assured that one or more of these rating agencies will not downgrade or withdraw entirely its rating of our senior notes low prices for natural gas ngls and oil an increase in the level of our indebtedness or other factors may result in moodys sp or fitch downgrading its rating of our senior notes changes in credit ratings may affect our access to the capital markets the cost of shortterm debt through interest rates and fees under our lines of credit the interest rate on the adjustable rate notes defined in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the rates available on new longterm debt our pool of investors and funding sources the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on our otc derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements including collateral in support of our midstream service contracts joint venture arrangements or construction contracts 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 55 billion of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

• require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities 

• limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on incurring additional debt making certain investments and paying dividends 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations 

• depending on the levels of our outstanding debt limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate and other purposes and 

• increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy including declines in prices for natural gas ngls and oil 

our debt agreements also require compliance with certain covenants if the price that we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance for more information about our debt agreements read capital resources and liquidity in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks 

our business and operating results can be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or other increases in the cost of capital resulting from a reduction in our credit rating or otherwise these changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce cash flows used for operating and capital expenditures and place us at a competitive disadvantage 

disruptions or volatility in the financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve favorable operating results in addition we are exposed to credit risk related to our credit facility to the extent that one or more of our lenders may be unable to provide necessary funding to us under our existing line of credit if it experiences liquidity problems 

derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 

to manage our exposure to price risk we currently and may in the future enter into derivative arrangements utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a portion of our future production such hedges are designed to lock in prices in order to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow these transactions limit our potential gains if natural gas ngls and oil prices rise above the price established by the hedge and we may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit with our hedge counterparties to the extent our liability under the derivative contract exceeds specified thresholds which would negatively impact our liquidity we have previously sustained losses as a result of certain of our derivative arrangements including a 38 billion loss in 2021 and we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future in addition derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which our production is less than expected or an event materially impacts natural gas ngls or oil prices or the relationship between the hedged price index and the natural gas ngls or oil sales price 

we cannot be certain that any derivative transaction we may enter into will adequately protect us from declines in the prices of natural gas ngls or oil furthermore where we choose not to engage in derivative transactions in the future we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas ngls or oil prices than our competitors who engage in derivative transactions lower natural gas ngls and oil prices may also negatively impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts at favorable prices 

derivative transactions also expose us to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract or enters bankruptcy or encounters some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint in this case we may not be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase which increases our exposure if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance we could incur a significant loss 

the accounting for the convertible notes may have a material effect on our reported financial results 

on april 28 2020 we issued the convertible notes defined in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements due may 1 2026 unless earlier redeemed repurchased or converted in accordance with gaap an issuer must separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost the effect on the accounting for the convertible notes is that the equity component is required to be included in additional paidin capital of shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as a debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes accordingly we will be required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense in current and future periods as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount over the term of the convertible notes we will report lower net income or greater net loss in our financial results because gaap requires interest to include both the current periods amortization of the debt discount and the instruments coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes 

in addition because we have the ability and intent to settle the convertible notes upon conversion by paying or delivering cash equal to the principal amount of the obligation and common stock for amounts over the principal amount the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes are accounted for using the treasury stock method and as such are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principal amount further under the treasury stock method the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess are issued we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle the convertible notes in cash or that the accounting standards will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method if we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the new accounting guidance that will be adopted on january 1 2022 as well as the effects that it will have on the accounting for the convertible notes 

risks associated with our human capital technology and other resources and service providers 

strategic determinations including the allocation of resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial position and reduce our future prospects 

our future prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business our operational strategy focuses on developing several multiwell pads in tandem through a process known as combodevelopment we have allocated a substantial portion of our financial human capital and other resources to pursuing this strategy including investing in new technologies and equipment restructuring our workforce and pursuing various esg and new venture initiatives geared towards enhancing our strategy we may not realize some or any of the anticipated strategic financial operational environmental and other anticipated benefits from our operational strategy and the corresponding investments we have made in pursuing our strategy additionally we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully execute combodevelopment projects at the pace and scale that we project which may delay or reduce our production and our reserves negatively affecting our associated revenues if we fail to identify and successfully execute optimal business strategies including the appropriate operational strategy and corresponding initiatives or fail to optimize our capital investments and the use of our other resources in furtherance of optimal business strategies our financial position and growth may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

cyber incidents targeting our digital work environment or other technologies or natural gas and oil industry systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations 

our business and the natural gas and oil industry in general have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies we depend on this technology to record and store data estimate quantities of natural gas ngls and oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers and mobile devices control nearly all of the natural gas ngls and oil distribution systems in the us which are necessary to transport our products to market 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our digital work environment or other technologies and infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas ngls and oil difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve and cyber attackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents the cost to remedy an unintended dissemination of sensitive information or data may be significant furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs completion services equipment supplies personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis 

the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations geologists geophysicists engineers and other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices causing periodic shortages or higher costs historically there have been shortages of personnel and equipment as demand for personnel and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled additionally our operations may be disrupted or impaired if a significant portion of our or our service providers employees or contractors are unable to work due to illness or if our field operations are suspended or temporarily shutdown or restricted due to control measures designed to contain the covid19 pandemic we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

our ability to drill for and produce natural gas is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for drilling and completion operations and access to water and waste disposal or recycling services at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of produced water and other waste may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to drill and complete natural gas wells requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water our ability to access sources of water and the availability of disposal alternatives to receive all of the water produced from our wells and used in hydraulic fracturing may affect our drilling and completion operations our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations or to timely obtain water sourcing permits or other rights could adversely affect our operations additionally the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of waste which would adversely affect our business and results of operations which could result in decreased cash flows 

in addition in recent years federal and state regulatory agencies have investigated the possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for natural gas and oil waste disposal and increased seismic activity in certain areas in some cases operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volume or suspend operations increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity in the states where we operate could lead to restrictions on our disposal well injection volume and increased scrutiny of and delay in obtaining new disposal well permits which could result in increased operating costs which could be material or a curtailment of our operations 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to identify attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with identifying attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot identify attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete in our industry could be harmed 

we depend on thirdparty midstream providers for a significant portion of our midstream services and our failure to obtain and maintain access to the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas ngls and oil to market on competitive terms may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

our delivery of natural gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities primarily owned by third parties and our ability to contract with these third parties at competitive rates or at all the capacity of transmission gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties competition for access to pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense and our ability to secure access to pipeline infrastructure on favorable economic terms could affect our competitive position 

we are dependent on thirdparty providers to provide us with access to midstream infrastructure to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market to the extent these services are delayed or unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production access to midstream assets may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may occur more slowly a lack of access to needed infrastructure or an extended interruption of access to or service from thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including vandalism terroristic acts sabotage or cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil 

finally in order to ensure access to certain midstream facilities we have entered into agreements that obligate us to pay demand charges to various pipeline operators we also have commitments with third parties for processing capacity we may be obligated to make payments under these agreements even if we do not fully use the capacity we have reserved and these payments may be significant 

the substantial majority of our midstream and water services are provided by one provider eqm midstream partners lp eqm a whollyowned subsidiary of equitrans midstream therefore any regulatory infrastructure or other events that materially adversely affect equitrans midstreams business operations will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other thirdparty service providers additionally our midstream services contracts with eqm involve significant longterm financial and other commitments on our part which hinders our ability to diversify our slate of midstream service providers and seek better economic and other terms for the midstream services that are provided to us we have no control over equitrans midstreams or eqms business decisions and operations and neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors us 

historically we have received the substantial majority of our natural gas gathering transmission and storage and water services from eqm additionally on february 26 2020 we executed a new gas gathering agreement with eqm the consolidated gga which among other things consolidated the majority of our prior gathering agreements with eqm into a single agreement established a new fee structure for gathering and compression fees charged by eqm increased our minimum volume commitments with eqm committed certain of our remaining undedicated acreage to eqm and extended our and eqms contractual obligations with each other to 2035 because we have significant longterm contractual commitments with eqm we expect to receive the majority of our midstream and water services from eqm for the foreseeable future therefore any event whether in our areas of operation or otherwise that adversely affects equitrans midstreams operations water assets pipelines other transportation facilities gathering and processing facilities financial condition leverage results of operations or cash flows will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other thirdparty service providers accordingly we are subject to the business risks of equitrans midstream including the following 

  

• federal state and local regulatory political and legal actions that could adversely affect equitrans midstreams and eqms operations assets and infrastructure including potential further delays associated with obtaining regulatory approval for the construction of the mountain valley pipeline 

• construction risks associated with the construction or repair of eqms pipelines and other midstream infrastructure such as delays caused by landowners or advocacy groups opposed to the natural gas industry environmental hazards adverse weather conditions the performance of thirdparty contractors the lack of available skilled labor equipment and materials and the inability to obtain necessary rightsofway or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all and maintain such rightsofway approvals and permits once obtained 

• cyberattacks or acts of sabotage or terrorism that could cause significant damage or injury to equitrans midstreams personnel assets or infrastructure or lead to extended interruptions of equitrans midstreams operations 

• risks associated with equitrans midstream failing to properly balance supply and demand for its services on a shortterm seasonal and longterm basis which could result in equitrans midstream being unable to provide its customers including us with sufficient access to pipeline and other midstream infrastructure and water services as needed and 

• risks associated with equitrans midstreams leverage and financial profile which could result in equitrans midstream being financially deterred or prohibited from providing services to its customers including us on a timely basis or at all 

in addition many of our midstream services obligations with eqm are firm commitments under which we have reserved an agreed upon amount of pipeline or storage capacity with eqm regardless of the capacity that we actually use during each month and we are generally obligated to pay a fixed monthly charge at an amount agreed upon in the contract because these obligations involve significant longterm financial and other commitments on our part they could reduce our cash flow during periods of low prices for natural gas ngls and oil when we may have lower volume of natural gas and ngls and therefore less of a need for capacity and storage or the market prices for such pipeline and storage capacity services may be lower than what we are contractually obligated to pay to eqm 

further the consolidated gga provides for a reduced fee structure for the gathering and compression fees charged by eqm however this new fee structure does not take effect until the mountain valley pipelines inservice date there can be no assurance that the inservice date of the mountain valley pipeline will not be delayed or that the project will not be cancelled entirely which would consequently delay possibly indefinitely the effective date of the fee reductions contemplated in the consolidated gga neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to renegotiate their contracts with us including the consolidated gga in the event of a prolonged depressed commodity price environment or if the mountain valley pipelines inservice date is delayed we have recorded in our consolidated balance sheet a contract asset of 410 million representing the estimated fair value of the rate relief provided by the consolidated gga that would be realized beginning with the mountain valley pipeline’s inservice date we review the contract asset for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable future delays in the mountain valley pipelines inservice date may affect our ability to fully realize the value we recorded as a contract asset for the rate relief associated with the consolidated gga which could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

substantially all of our producing properties are concentrated in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area 

substantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the appalachian basin as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by and costs associated with governmental regulation state and local political activities processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations availability of equipment and personnel water shortages or other weatherrelated conditions interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas ngls or oil and changes in state and local laws judicial precedents political regimes and regulations such conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in addition a number of areas within the appalachian basin have historically been subject to mining operations for example third parties may engage in subsurface coal and other mining operations near or under our properties which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties adversely impact our drilling operations or adversely impact thirdparty midstream activities on which we rely in such event our operations may be impaired or interrupted and we may not be able to recover the costs incurred as a result of temporary shutins or the plugging and abandonment of any of our wells furthermore the existence of mining operations near our properties could require coordination to avoid adverse impacts as a result of drilling and mining in close proximity these restrictions on our operations and any similar restrictions could cause delays or interruptions or prevent us from executing our business strategy which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

further insufficient takeaway capacity in the appalachian basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized natural gas prices the appalachian basin has experienced periods in which production has surpassed local takeaway capacity resulting in substantial discounts in the price received by producers such as us and others at times being possibly shut in although additional appalachian basin takeaway capacity has been added in recent years the existing and expected capacity may not be sufficient to keep pace with the increased production caused by accelerated drilling in the area in the short term 

due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties 

legal and regulatory risks 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

opposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activities generally has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the us and companies in our industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and nongovernmental organizations regarding safety human rights environmental matters sustainability and business practices negative public perception regarding us andor our industry may lead to increased litigation and regulatory legislative and judicial scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations in safety environmental royalty and surface use areas these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed challenged or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business in addition antidevelopment activists are working to among other things reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development if activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development persists or increases there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas ngls and oil that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 

in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment in recent years several regulations at the federal and state level have been adopted and more are being considered to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs 

in february 2021 the us formally rejoined the paris agreement an international treaty signed by nearly 200 counties which calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and to be transparent about the measures they will implement to achieve their ghg emissions targets in furtherance of the objectives of the paris agreement in april 2021 the biden administration announced goals aimed at reducing the us’s ghg emissions by 5052 compared to 2005 levels by 2030 the federal government has correspondingly instituted several regulations and initiatives in alignment with the goal of reducing the us’s ghg emissions 

in june 2021 president biden signed legislation reinstituting regulations which were previously repealed by the trump administration establishing nsps for methane and voc from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities additionally the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that among other things establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal or criteria pollutant emissions facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that will be established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a case‑by‑case basis furthermore in november 2021 the epa announced proposed rules expanding upon the nsps rule which if instituted would establish standards for existing wells impose more frequent and stringent leak monitoring and mandate that all pneumatic controllers have zero emissions 

separately there have also been several instances of proposed legislation at the federal level which seek to impose a fee on methane emissions most recently in november 2021 the us house of representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill known as the build back better act the version of the bill approved by the house includes a provision that would impose charges on oil and gas facilities for their methane emissions under the bill the epa would levy methane fees starting at 900 per ton in 2023 increasing to 1200 in 2024 and then 1500 in 2025 and each year thereafter the fee would apply to each ton of methane emissions in excess of 020 of the gas sold by the facility the bill is currently under review by the us senate and it is unclear at this time as to what the final terms of any proposed methane fee may be 

these federal rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits additionally to the extent a fee on methane andor carbon emissions is approved at the federal level we the utilities that purchase our natural gas andor the consumers of our natural gas and other hydrocarbons may bear increased costs associated with such fees which may lead to an increase in our operating costs andor a decrease in the demand for our produced hydrocarbons 

at the state level several states including pennsylvania have proceeded with a number of state and regional efforts aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of capandtrade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs in october 2019 pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed an executive order directing the padep to draft regulations establishing a capandtrade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions with the intent of enabling pennsylvania to join rggi a multistate regional capandtrade program comprised of several eastern us states in september 2020 the eqb approved promulgation of the rggi regulation and a public comment period and hearings regarding the regulation commenced at the end of 2020 in september 2021 pennsylvania’s independent regulatory review commission adopted a regulation approving pennsylvania’s participation in rggi however in october 2021 the pennsylvania senate approved a resolution to block the states participation in rggi and such resolution was subsequently approved by the pennsylvania house in december 2021 on january 10 2022 governor wolf vetoed the senates resolution and as a result it is likely that pennsylvania will join rggi in 2022 unless the pennsylvania legislature overrides the governors veto by the vote of twothirds of the members of each of the pennsylvania house and senate in the event that pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of rggi it will result in increased operating costs if we are required to purchase emission allowances in connection with our operations 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the natural gas ngls and oil we produce and lower the value of our reserves 

further recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energyrelated assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations see businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation for more information 

we are subject to complex federal state local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities 

our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of water and other fluids and materials including solid and hazardous wastes incidental to natural gas and oil operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of properties some states allow the statutory pooling and unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration as well as joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and natural gas and oil laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air ground and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed and work practices related to employee health and safety 

to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits approvals and certificates from various federal state and local governmental authorities maintaining compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas ngls and oil resources these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages in addition our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations such costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages as well as corrective action costs 

changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely impact our earnings and the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our operations 

members of congress periodically introduce legislation to revise us federal income tax laws which could have a material impact on us the most significant potential tax law changes that could impact us include increases in the regular income tax rate a new minimum tax based on net income a new excise tax on stock repurchases the repeal of expensing intangible drilling costs or percentage depletion the repeal of likekind exchange tax deferral rules on real property and further limited deductibility of interest expense any of which could adversely impact our current and deferred federal and state income tax liabilities most recently in november 2021 the us house passed the build back better act which includes some but not all of these proposals the bill is currently under review by the us senate and it is unclear at this time what if any changes to the tax laws applicable to us will be enacted state and local taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate or own assets may enact new taxes such as the imposition of a severance tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce natural gas ngls and oil or change the rates of existing taxes which could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

our hedging activities are subject to numerous and evolving financial laws and regulations which could inhibit our ability to effectively hedge our production against commodity price risk or increase our cost of compliance 

we use financial derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas ngls and oil prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank act which established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors prudential regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation among other things the doddfrank act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivative activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act have yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including the enduser exception which exempts certain endusers from having to comply with mandatory clearing a margin rule mandating margining for certain uncleared swaps and a position limits rule imposing federal position limits on certain futures contracts relating to energy products including natural gas 

we qualify as a nonfinancial entity for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for such exception as a result our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing although we are subject to certain recordkeeping and reporting obligations associated with such rule we also qualify as a nonfinancial end user for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally we believe that the majority if not all of our hedging activities constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and are not materially impacted by the limitations under such rule however many of our hedge counterparties and other market participants are not eligible for the enduser exception are subject to mandatory clearing and the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties and may be subject to the position limits rule which may affect the pricing andor availability of derivatives for us in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of our derivative contracts alter the terms of our derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts lessen the number of available counterparties and in turn increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations we have experienced increased and anticipate additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing financial regulatory environment 

federal state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of natural gas and oil wells which could adversely affect our production 

we use hydraulic fracturing in the completion of our wells hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state natural gas and oil commissions but the epa prohibits the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells see businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation for more information 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these delays costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and workplace safety including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time resulting in longer waiting periods to receive permits and other regulatory approvals failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations 

strict joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental and occupational health and workplace safety impacts of our operations we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such matters 

in addition new or additional laws and regulations new interpretations of existing requirements or changes in enforcement policies could impose unforeseen liabilities significantly increase compliance costs or result in delays of or denial of rights to conduct our development programs for example in june 2015 the epa and the corps issued a rule under the cwa defining the scope of the epas and the corps jurisdiction over wotus which never took effect before being replaced by the nwpr in december 2019 a coalition of states and cities environmental groups and agricultural groups challenged the nwpr which was vacated by a federal district court in august 2021 in addition in an april 2020 decision further defining the scope of the cwa the us supreme court held that in certain cases discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the cwa and require a permit the court rejected the epa and corps’ assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the cwa the epa is undergoing a rulemaking process to redefine the definition of waters of the united states in the interim the epa is using the pre2015 definition to the extent a new rule or further litigation expands the scope of the cwas jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas such potential regulations or litigation could increase our operating costs reduce our liquidity delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position further the discharges of natural gas ngls oil and other pollutants into the air soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties 

regulations related to the protection of wildlife could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

our operations can be adversely affected by regulations designed to protect various wildlife including threatened and endangered species and their critical habitat the implementation of measures to protect wildlife or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in constraints on our exploration and production activities this limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 

fuel conservation measures consumer tastes and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil the impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

risks associated with strategic transactions 

entering into strategic transactions may expose us to various risks 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory and thirdparty approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from these transactions competition for transaction opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing transactions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility 

moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little or partial control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

acquisitions may disrupt our current plans or operations and may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas ngls and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well or lease that we acquire and even when we inspect a well or lease we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

if there is a later determination that our spinoff of equitrans midstream or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor opinion of counsel are incorrect or for any other reason significant liabilities could be incurred by us our shareholders or equitrans midstream 

in connection with our 2018 spinoff of equitrans midstream as a separate publiclytraded company we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution defined and discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code as amended and certain other us federal income tax matters relating to the distribution and certain related transactions the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel are based on and rely on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us and equitrans midstream including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and equitrans midstream if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if we or equitrans midstream breach any representations or covenants contained in any of the spinoffrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel 

notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the ruling or for other reasons an opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in such opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we equitrans midstream and our shareholders could be subject to material us federal and state income tax liabilities in connection with the spinoff we and equitrans midstream entered into a tax matters agreement which described the sharing of any such liabilities between us and equitrans midstream 

we are a significant shareholder of equitrans midstream and the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may fluctuate substantially 

following the spinoff of equitrans midstream we retained approximately 199 of the outstanding shares of equitrans midstreams common stock on february 26 2020 we entered into share purchase agreements with equitrans midstream to sell approximately 50 of our equity interest in equitrans midstream to equitrans midstream the equitrans share exchange in exchange for a combination of cash and fee relief under our gathering agreements with eqm we subsequently sold additional shares of our retained interest in equitrans midstream through open market sales and we currently own 22796026 shares of equitrans midstreams common stock the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may be adversely affected by negative changes in its results of operations cash flows and financial position which may occur as a result of the many risks attendant with operating in the midstream industry including loss of gathering and transportation volume the effect of laws and regulations on the operation of its business and development of its assets increased competition loss of contracted volume adverse ratemaking decisions policies and rulings by the ferc pipeline safety rulemakings initiated or finalized by the department of transportations pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration delays in the timing of or the failure to complete expansion projects lack of access to capital and operating risks and hazards 

we intend to dispose of our remaining interest in equitrans midstream through one or more divestitures of our shares of equitrans midstreams common stock however we can offer no assurance that we will be able to complete such disposition or as to the value we will realize the occurrence of any of these and other risks faced by equitrans midstream could adversely affect the value of our investment in equitrans midstream

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

net loss attributable to eqt corporation for 2021 was 1156 million 358 per diluted share compared to net loss attributable to eqt corporation for 2020 of 967 million 371 per diluted share the change was attributable primarily to the loss on derivatives not designated as hedges increased depreciation and depletion increased transportation and processing and the gain on the equitrans share exchange defined and discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements recognized in the first quarter of 2020 partly offset by increased sales of natural gas ngls and oil the income from investments higher income tax benefit and the gain on saleexchange of longlived assets 

results of operations for 2021 include the results of approximately six months of our operation of assets acquired in the alta acquisition which closed in july 2021 the results of a full year of our operation of assets acquired from chevron usa inc the chevron acquisition which closed in november 2020 and nine months of our operation of assets acquired from reliance marcellus llc the reliance asset acquisition see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the alta acquisition chevron acquisition and reliance asset acquisition

average realized price reconciliation 

the following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of our consolidated operations including the calculation of our average realized price mcfe which is based on adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons of earnings trends adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to total operating revenues see nongaap financial measures reconciliation for a reconciliation of adjusted operating revenues with total operating revenues the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 



a basis represents the difference between the ultimate sales price for natural gas including the effects of delivered price benefit or deficit associated with our firm transportation agreements and the nymex natural gas price 

b ngls ethane and oil were converted to mcfe at a rate of six mcfe per barrel 

c total natural gas and liquids sales including cash settled derivatives is also referred to in this report as adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure 

nongaap financial measures reconciliation 

the table below reconciles adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure with total operating revenues its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted operating revenues also referred to in this report as total natural gas and liquids sales including cash settled derivatives is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons of earnings trends adjusted operating revenues excludes the revenue impacts of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and net marketing services and other we use adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because as a result of the measures exclusion of the oftenvolatile changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts net marketing services and other consists of the costs of and recoveries on pipeline capacity releases revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and other revenues because we consider net marketing services and other to be unrelated to our natural gas and liquids production activities adjusted operating revenues excludes net marketing services and other we believe that adjusted operating revenues provides useful information to investors for evaluating periodtoperiod comparisons of earnings trends 



sales volume and revenues 



sales of natural gas ngls and oil sales of natural gas ngls and oil increased for 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased sales volume and a higher average realized price 

sales volume increased primarily as a result of sales volume increases of 170 bcfe from the assets acquired in the alta acquisition sales volume increases of 127 bcfe from the assets acquired in the chevron acquisition prior year sales volume decreases of 46 bcfe from the 2020 strategic production curtailments and sales volume increases as a result of the reliance asset acquisition and from wells turned inline during 2021 partly offset by sales volume decreases 9 bcfe from the 2020 divestiture defined in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

the 2020 strategic production curtailments refers to our strategic decisions to temporarily curtail 2020 production in may 2020 we temporarily curtailed approximately 14 bcf per day of gross production equivalent to approximately 10 bcf per day of net production in july 2020 we began a moderated approach to bring back online the curtailed production in september 2020 we curtailed approximately 06 bcf per day of gross production equivalent to approximately 04 bcf per day of net production in october 2020 we began a phased approach to bring back online the curtailed production which was completed in november 2020 

average realized price increased due to higher nymex prices and higher liquids prices partly offset by lower cash settled derivatives and unfavorable differential for 2021 and 2020 we paid 20910 million and received 8972 million respectively of net cash settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges which are included in average realized price but may not be included in operating revenues 

loss gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for 2021 and 2020 we recognized a loss of 37750 million and a gain of 4002 million respectively on derivatives not designated as hedges the loss for 2021 was related primarily to decreases in the fair market value of our nymex swaps and options due to increases in nymex forward prices the gain for 2020 was related primarily to increases in the fair market value of our nymex swaps and options due to decreases in nymex forward prices 

net marketing services and other net marketing services and other increased for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the liquids uplift realized on gas purchased at the wellhead from other operators and thirdparty gathering revenues recognized on the midstream assets acquired in the alta acquisition 

operating expenses 

the following table presents information on our productionrelated operating expenses 



gathering gathering expense increased on an absolute basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased sales volume gathering expense decreased on a per mcfe basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the lower gathering rate structures on the assets acquired in the chevron acquisition and alta acquisition and increased sales volume which resulted in our utilization of lower overrun rates as part of the consolidated gga defined and discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

transmission transmission expense increased on an absolute basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to additional capacity acquired as part of the alta acquisition transmission expense decreased on a per mcfe basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increased sales volume from the chevron acquisition and alta acquisition which have a lower average transmission expense per mcfe when compared to our historical transmission portfolio 

processing processing expense increased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased liquid sales volume as a result of increased development of liquidsrich areas and increased processed volume from the chevron acquisition 

loe loe increased on an absolute basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to additional lease operating costs as a result of the alta acquisition and chevron acquisition 

production taxes production taxes increased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased west virginia severance taxes which resulted primarily from higher prices and increased pennsylvania impact fees which resulted from higher prices and additional wells acquired in the alta acquisition and chevron acquisition 

exploration exploration expense increased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to our purchase of seismic data following the completion of the alta acquisition 

selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expense increased on an absolute basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher longterm incentive compensation costs as a result of changes in the fair value of awards as well as higher litigation expense selling general and administrative expense decreased on a per mcfe basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increased sales volumes and nominal incremental selling general and administrative spend with respect to the alta acquisition and chevron acquisition 

depreciation and depletion production depletion expense increased on an absolute basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased sales volume partly offset by a lower annual depletion rate production depletion expense decreased on a per mcfe basis for 2021 compared to 2020 due to a lower annual depletion rate 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for 2020 was 260 million our intangible assets were fully amortized in november 2020 

gain lossimpairment on saleexchange of longlived assets  during 2021 we recognized a gain on saleexchange of longlived assets of 211 million related primarily to changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration defined and discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements from the 2020 divestiture during 2020 we recognized a loss on saleexchange of longlived assets of 1007 million of which 616 million related to the 2020 asset exchange transactions defined and discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and 391 million related to asset sales including the 2020 divestiture 

impairment of intangible and other assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 we recognized impairment of 347 million of which 228 million related to our assessment that the fair values of certain of our rightofuse lease assets were less than their carrying values and 119 million related to impairments of certain of our nonoperating receivables as a result of expected credit losses 

impairment and expiration of leases during 2021 and 2020 we recognized impairment and expiration of leases of 3118 million and 3067 million respectively related to impairment and expiration of leases that we no longer expect to develop based on our development strategy 

other operating expenses other operating expenses for 2021 of 701 million were attributable primarily to transaction costs associated with the alta acquisition and chevron acquisition other operating expenses for 2020 of 285 million were attributable primarily to transactions changes in legal reserves including settlements and reorganization see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of other operating expenses 

other income statement items 

  

gain on equitrans share exchange during the first quarter of 2020 we recognized a gain on the equitrans share exchange of 1872 million see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

income loss from investments for 2021 we recognized income on our investments in equitrans midstream and laurel mountain midstream see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements our investment in equitrans midstream fluctuates with changes in equitrans midstreams stock price which was 1034 and 804 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively for 2020 we recognized a loss on our investment in equitrans midstream due to a decrease in equitrans midstreams stock price 

dividend and other income dividend and other income decreased for 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to lower dividends received from our investment in equitrans midstream driven by a decrease in the number of shares of equitrans midstreams common stock that we owned as well as a decrease in the dividend amount per share 

loss on debt extinguishment during 2021 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 98 million due to fees incurred for a bridgeloan commitment related to the alta acquisition and the repayment of our 4875 senior notes during 2020 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 254 million related to the repayment of all or a portion of our 4875 senior notes 250 senior notes 300 senior notes floating rate notes and term loan facility see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense interest expense increased for 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased interest incurred on new debt related to the chevron acquisition and alta acquisition increased amortization expense due primarily to our convertible debt and higher periodic borrowings under our credit facility see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

income tax benefit see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of oil and gas properties 

see critical accounting policies and estimates and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of our oil and gas properties see also item 1a risk factors – natural gas ngls and oil price declines and changes in our development strategy have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including longlived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

capital resources and liquidity 

  

although we cannot provide any assurance we believe cash flows from operating activities and availability under our credit facility should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements inclusive of but not limited to normal operating needs debt service obligations planned capital expenditures and commitments for at least the next twelve months and based on current expectations for the long term 

credit facility 

we primarily use borrowings under our credit facility to fund working capital needs timing differences between capital expenditures and other cash uses and cash flows from operating activities margin deposit requirements on our derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements including collateral in support of our midstream service contracts joint venture arrangements or construction contracts see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our credit facility 

known contractual and other obligations planned capital expenditures 

purchase obligations we have commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines some of which extend up to 20 years or longer we have entered into agreements to release some of our capacity under these longterm contracts we also have commitments for processing capacity in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream aggregate future payments for these items as of december 31 2021 were 238 billion composed of 17 billion in 2022 18 billion in 2023 18 billion in 2024 18 billion in 2025 17 billion in 2026 and 150 billion thereafter primarily in 2027 through 2042 

in addition we have commitments to pay for services and materials related to our operations which primarily include minimum volume commitments to obtain water services and electric hydraulic fracturing services and commitments to purchase equipment materials and sand as of december 31 2021 future commitments under these contracts were 1356 million in 2022 990 million in 2023 475 million in 2024 400 million in 2025 400 million in 2026 and 1783 million thereafter 

contractual commitments we have contractual commitments under our debt agreements including interest payments and principal repayments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the contractual commitments under our debt agreements including the timing of principal repayments 

unrecognized tax benefits as discussed further in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2021 we had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of 941 million and an additional reserve of 972 million that was offset against deferred tax assets for general business tax credit carryforwards and nols we are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities 

planned capital expenditures and sales volume  in 2022 we expect to spend approximately 130 to 145 billion in total capital expenditures excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest we expect to fund planned capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our credit facility because we are the operator of a high percentage of our acreage the amount and timing of these capital expenditures are largely discretionary we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2022 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas ngls and oil the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals and drilling completion and acquisition costs sales volume in 2022 is expected to be 1950 to 2050 bcfe 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1662 million for 2021 compared to 1538 million for 2020 the increase was due primarily to higher cash operating revenues partly offset by the cash settlements paid on derivatives not designated as hedges higher cash operating expenses and income tax refunds received in the prior year 

our cash flows from operating activities are affected by movements in the market price for commodities we are unable to predict such movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing refer to item 1a risk factors – natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position for further information 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2073 million for 2021 compared to 1556 million for 2020 the increase was due primarily to higher cash paid for acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of assets in 2020 

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures 



  

a capital expenditures attributable to noncontrolling interest were 96 million and 49 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

b represents the net impact of noncash capital expenditures including the effect of timing of receivables from working interest partners accrued capital expenditures and capitalized sharebased compensation costs the impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the current period estimate net of the reversal of the prior period accrual 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 506 million for 2021 compared to 32 million for 2020 for 2021 the primary source of financing cash flows was proceeds from the issuance of debt and the primary uses of financing cash flows were net credit facility borrowings and repayment and retirement of debt for 2020 the primary source of financing cash flows was proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity and the primary use of financing cash flows was repayment and retirement of debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt 

on february 3 2022 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0125 per share payable on march 1 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 14 2022 

depending on our actual and anticipated sources and uses of liquidity prevailing market conditions and other factors we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases in the open market or privately negotiated transactions the amounts involved in any such transactions may be material additionally we plan to dispose of our remaining retained shares of equitrans midstreams common stock and use the proceeds to reduce our debt 

see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 which is incorporated herein by reference for discussion and analysis of operating investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31 2019 

security ratings and financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the credit ratings and rating outlooks assigned to our debt instruments at february 4 2022 our credit ratings and rating outlooks are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independent from any other rating we cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency if in the rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of what is deemed investment grade 



changes in credit ratings may affect our access to the capital markets the cost of shortterm debt through interest rates and fees under our lines of credit the interest rate on our senior notes with adjustable rates the rates available on new longterm debt our pool of investors and funding sources the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on our otc derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements including collateral in support of our midstream service contracts joint venture arrangements or construction contracts margin deposits on our otc derivative instruments are also subject to factors other than credit rating such as natural gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in the agreements between us and our hedging counterparties 

as of february 4 2022 we had sufficient unused borrowing capacity net of letters of credit under our credit facility to satisfy any requests for margin deposit or other collateral that our counterparties are permitted to request of us pursuant to our otc derivative instruments midstream services contracts and other contracts as of february 4 2022 such assurances could be up to approximately 11 billion inclusive of letters of credit otc derivative instrument margin deposits and other collateral posted of approximately 08 billion in the aggregate 

during the third quarter of 2021 we amended agreements with six of our largest otc hedge counterparties to permanently or temporarily reduce or eliminate our margin posting obligations associated with our otc derivative instruments with such otc hedge counterparties the purpose of such amendments was to mitigate the amount of cash collateral that we would otherwise have been required to post based on current nymex strip pricing as of february 4 2022 our margin balance on our existing hedge portfolio including both otc and broker margin balances was approximately 03 billion compared to approximately 01 billion as of december 31 2020 despite a significant increase in natural gas prices see notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

our debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that if not complied with could result in default or event of default under our credit facility mandatory partial or full repayment of amounts outstanding reduced loan capacity or other similar actions the most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debttototal capitalization ratio limitations on transactions with affiliates insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions our credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to have a total debttototal capitalization ratio no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants under our debt agreements 

see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of borrowings under our credit facility 

commodity risk management 

the substantial majority of our commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of our produced natural gas the overall objective of our hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the derivative commodity instruments that we use are primarily swap collar and option agreements the following table summarizes the approximate volume and prices of our nymex hedge positions through 2024 as of february 4 2022 



a january 1 through march 31 

b the difference between the fixed price and nymex price is included in average differential presented in our price reconciliation in average realized price reconciliation the fixed price natural gas sales agreements can be physically or financially settled 

for 2022 2023 and 2024 we have natural gas sales agreements for approximately 18 mmdth 88 mmdth and 11 mmdth respectively that include average nymex ceiling prices of 317 284 and 321 respectively 

during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 we purchased 67 million of net winter calls to reposition our 2021 and 2022 hedge portfolio to enable incremental upside participation in rising natural gas prices and to further mitigate potential incremental margin posting requirements as of december 31 2021 the remaining positions cover approximately 45 net mmdth in the first quarter of 2022 and have been excluded from the table above 

we have also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis we may use other contractual agreements to implement our commodity hedging strategy from time to time 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our hedging program 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees 

commitments and contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against us while the amounts claimed may be substantial we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings we accrue legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred we have established reserves that we believe to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance we believe that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against us will not materially affect our financial condition results of operations or liquidity see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies see item 3 legal proceedings 

recently issued accounting standards 

our recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements managements discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee relate to our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from our estimates 

  

accounting for gas ngls and oil producing activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurement and any subsequent impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other longlived assets as well as evaluation of the recoverability of capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties 

  

we believe accounting for gas ngls and oil producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls and future production costs as well as the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and timing of recoveries significant changes in these estimates could result in the costs of our proved and unproved properties not being recoverable therefore we would be required to recognize impairment see impairment of oil and gas properties and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

our estimates of proved reserves are reassessed annually using geological reservoir and production performance data reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers and audited by independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices operating costs economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in certain proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volume of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and our consolidated financial statements 

  

we estimate future net cash flows from natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a twelvemonth average price which is calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the twelvemonth period and as such is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is based on future statutory tax rates and tax deductions and credits available under current laws 

we believe oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because we must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates production costs and the timing of development expenditures future results of operations and the strength of our consolidated balance sheet for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions significant changes in these estimates could result in a change to our estimated reserves which could lead to a material change to our production depletion expense see impairment of oil and gas properties for additional information on our oil and gas reserves 

  

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting policies related to income taxes and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of deferred tax assets valuation allowances and the amount of financial statement benefit recorded for uncertain tax positions 

we believe income taxes are critical accounting estimates because we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit recorded for uncertain tax positions to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period we record an expense or benefit in income tax expense in our statements of consolidated operations future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions a change to future taxable income or tax planning strategies could impact our ability to utilize deferred tax assets which would increase or decrease our income tax expense and taxes paid 

derivative instruments we enter into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to reduce exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the fair value hierarchy see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the derivative liability recorded in connection with the equitrans share exchange the values reported in the consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or as market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond our control change 

we believe derivative instruments are critical accounting estimates because our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to the volatility of both nymex natural gas prices and basis future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for discussion of a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas 

business combinations accounting for a business combination requires a company to record the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at fair value in the third quarter of 2021 we completed the alta acquisition and in the fourth quarter of 2020 we completed the chevron acquisition see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the most significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 

we believe business combinations are critical accounting estimates because the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities involves significant judgment about future events future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability for contingencies based on our assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we consider many factors in making these assessments including historical experience and matter specifics estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

we accrue a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the amount and timing of settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of our plugging and abandonment obligations is recorded at the time the obligation is incurred which is typically at the time the well is spud see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because we must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligation settlement in addition we must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions if we incur losses related to contingencies that are higher than we expect we could incur additional costs to settle such obligations if the expected amount and timing of our asset retirement obligations change we will be required to adjust the carrying value of our liabilities in future periods 

contract asset in the first quarter of 2020 we entered into two share purchase agreements with equitrans midstream to sell to equitrans midstream 50 of our ownership of equitrans midstreams common stock in exchange for a combination of cash and rate relief under certain of our gathering agreements with eqm an affiliate of equitrans midstream see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the key assumptions used in the fair value calculation of the contract asset and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment considerations 

we believe the consolidated gga contract asset is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used in the valuation of the contract asset involved significant judgment future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions a change in the estimated production volume forecast the marketbased discount rate or the probabilityweighted estimate of the inservice date of the mountain valley pipeline could have resulted in a change in the valuation of the contract asset 

convertible notes in the second quarter of 2020 we issued the convertible notes and capped call transactions each defined and discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our valuation of the liability and equity components and accounting for the capped call transactions and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the effect of the convertible notes on our earnings per share calculations 

we believe the accounting complexity of the convertible notes is a critical accounting estimate because we used judgment to determine the balance sheet classification to determine the treatment of the capped call transactions and to determine the existence of any derivatives that may require separate accounting under applicable accounting guidance future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk and derivative instruments our primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas and ngls at our ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations prolonged low or significant extended declines in natural gas and ngls prices could adversely affect among other things our development plans which would decrease the pace of development and the level of our proved reserves increases in natural gas and ngls prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels in addition to the extent we have hedged our production at prices below the current market price we will not benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas and depending on our thencurrent credit ratings and the terms of our hedging contracts we may be required to post additional margin with our hedging counterparties 

the overall objective of our hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices our use of derivatives is further described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and commodity risk management under capital resources and liquidity in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our otc derivative commodity instruments are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of those institutions is regularly monitored we primarily enter into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production we also enter into derivative instruments to hedge basis our use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by our managementlevel hedge and financial risk committee and is reviewed by our board of directors 

  

for derivative commodity instruments used to hedge our forecasted sales of production which are at for the most part nymex natural gas prices we set policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels that are exposed to price risk we have an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

the derivative commodity instruments we use are primarily swap collar and option agreements these agreements may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity we use these agreements to hedge our nymex and basis exposure we may also use other contractual agreements when executing our commodity hedging strategy we monitor price and production levels on a continuous basis and make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted 

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the nymex natural gas price on december 31 2021 and 2020 would increase the fair value of our natural gas derivative commodity instruments by approximately 577 million and 501 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the nymex natural gas price on december 31 2021 and 2020 would decrease the fair value of our natural gas derivative commodity instruments by approximately 581 million and 495 million respectively for purposes of this analysis we applied the 10 change in the nymex natural gas price on december 31 2021 and 2020 to our natural gas derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2021 and 2020 to calculate the hypothetical change in fair value the change in fair value was determined using a method similar to our normal process for determining derivative commodity instrument fair value described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

the above analysis of our derivative commodity instruments does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on our physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge our forecasted produced gas approximates a portion of our expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge our forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on our physical sales of natural gas assuming that the derivative commodity instruments are not closed in advance of their expected term and the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

interest rate risk changes in market interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our credit facility none of the interest we pay on our senior notes fluctuates based on changes to market interest rates a 1 increase in interest rates on the borrowings under our credit facility during the year ended december 31 2021 would have increased interest expense by approximately 6 million 

interest rates on our 6125 senior notes due 2025 and 700 senior notes due 2030 fluctuate based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes by moodys sp and fitch interest rates on our other outstanding senior notes do not fluctuate based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes by moodys sp and fitch for a discussion of credit rating downgrade risk see item 1a risk factors – our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value measurement of our debt 

other market risks we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change our otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as the financial industry as a whole we use various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate our credit risk exposures including monitoring current market conditions and counterparty credit fundamentals credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk we enter into transactions primarily with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enter into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

approximately 17 or 477 million of our otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2021 had a positive fair value approximately 47 or 456 million of our otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2020 had a positive fair value 

  

as of december 31 2021 we were not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to our derivative contracts during the year ended december 31 2021 we made no adjustments to the fair value of our derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in our established fair value procedure we monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of our derivative contracts 

  

we are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas ngls and oil revenues and related accounts receivable from our operations are generated primarily from the sale of produced natural gas ngls and oil to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets that are accessible through our transportation portfolio which includes markets in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states and canada we also contract with certain processors to market a portion of ngls on our behalf 

no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for our credit facility holds more than 10 of the financial commitments under such facility the large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit our exposure to disruption or consolidation in the banking industry

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a natural gas production company with operations focused in the marcellus and utica shales of the appalachian basin based on average daily sales volumes we are the largest producer of natural gas in the united states as of december 31 2020 we had 198 tcfe of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves across approximately 18 million gross acres including approximately 15 million gross acres in the marcellus play 

strategy 

we are committed to responsibly developing our worldclass asset base and being the operator of choice for all stakeholders by promoting a culture that prioritizes operational efficiency technology and sustainability we seek to continuously improve the way we produce environmentally responsible reliable lowcost energy we believe that the scale and contiguity of our acreage position differentiates us from our appalachian basin peers and that our evolution into a modern digitallyenabled exploration and production business enhances our strategic advantage 

our operational strategy focuses on the successful execution of combodevelopment projects combodevelopment refers to the development of several multiwell pads in tandem combodevelopment generates value across all levels of the reserves development process by maximizing operational and capital efficiencies in the drilling stage rigs spend more time drilling and less time transitioning to new sites advanced planning a prerequisite to pursuing combodevelopment facilitates the delivery of bulk hydraulic fracturing sand and piped fresh water as opposed to trucktransported water the ability to continuously meet completions supply needs and the use of environmentally friendly technologies operational efficiencies realized from combodevelopment are passed on to our service providers which reduces overall contract rates 

the benefits of combodevelopment extend beyond financial gains to include environmental and social interests we have developed an integrated esg program that interplays with our combodevelopmentdriven operational strategy core tenets of our esg program include investing in technology and human capital improving data collection analysis and reporting and engaging with stakeholders to understand and align our actions with their needs and expectations combodevelopment when compared to similar production from noncombodevelopment operations translates into fewer trucks on the road decreased fuel usage shorter periods of noise pollution fewer areas impacted by midstream pipeline construction and shortened duration of site operations all of which fosters a greater focus on safety and environmental protection 

combodevelopment projects require significant advanced planning including the establishment of a large contiguous leasehold position the advanced acquisition of regulatory permits and sourcing of fracturing sand and water the timely verification of midstream connectivity and the ability to quickly respond to internal and external stimuli without a modern digitallyconnected operating model or an acreage position that enables operations of this scale combodevelopment would not be possible 

we believe that our proprietary digital work environment in conjunction with the size and contiguity of our asset base uniquely position us to execute on a multiyear inventory of combodevelopment projects in our core acreage position our operational strategy employs this differentiation to advance our mission of being the operator of choice for all stakeholders we believe that combodevelopment projects are key to delivering sustainably low well costs and higher returns on invested capital and that our longterm transformative plan has been designed to create value by leveraging our strategic advantage both operational and environmental over our peers 

2020 highlights 

• achieved 2020 sales volumes of 1498 bcfe or average daily sales volumes of 41 bcfe per day received an average realized price of 237 per mcfe 

• reduced 2020 capital expenditures by 694 million or 391 compared to 2019 while delivering flat sales volumes 

• increased total proved reserves by 23 tcfe or 13 in 2020 compared to 2019 

• decreased total debt by 368 million and addressed nearterm maturities improving our financial position 

• executed a new gas gathering agreement and exchanged half of our equity stake in equitrans midstream substantially reducing our future gathering fee structure 

table of contents 

• acquired strategic assets from chevron usa inc located in the appalachian basin for an aggregate purchase price of 735 million chevron acquisition 

• divested certain nonstrategic assets for an aggregate purchase price of 125 million 

• executed longterm contract to use electric hydraulic fracturing services in our completions operations promoting our esg initiatives 

• received approximately 440 million in federal income tax refunds including interest 

outlook 

in 2021 we expect to spend approximately 11 to 12 billion in total capital expenditures excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests we expect to fund planned capital expenditures with cash generated from operations allocated as follows approximately 800 to 850 million to fund reserve development approximately 125 to 140 million to fund land and lease acquisitions approximately 130 to 155 million to fund other production infrastructure and approximately 45 to 55 million applied towards capitalized overhead reserve development capital expenditures will be spent across our three primary operating areas with approximately 65 spent in pennsylvania marcellus approximately 30 spent in west virginia marcellus and approximately 5 spent in ohio utica our 2021 capital expenditure program is expected to deliver sales volumes of 1620 bcfe to 1700 bcfe an increase of 120200 bcfe when compared to 2020 sales volumes primarily driven by increased production from the chevron acquisition 

our revenues earnings liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices we receive for and our ability to develop our reserves of natural gas ngls and oil due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil at our ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations changes in natural gas ngls and oil prices could affect among other things our development plans which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of our reserves as well as our revenues earnings or liquidity lower prices and changes in our development plans could also result in noncash impairments in the book value of our oil and gas properties or downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves any such impairments or downward adjustments to our estimated reserves could potentially be material to us 

see impairment of oil and gas properties and critical accounting policies and estimates included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant assumptions related to accounting for gas ngl and oil producing activities and our accounting policies and processes related to impairment reviews for proved and unproved property 

segment and geographical information 

our operations consist of one reportable segment we have a single companywide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an areabyarea basis substantially all of our assets and operations are located in the appalachian basin 

reserves 

  

the following tables summarize our proved developed and undeveloped natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months and disaggregated by product and play substantially all of our reserves reside in continuous accumulations 



table of contents 



the following table summarizes our proved developed and undeveloped reserves using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months and disaggregated by state 



our 2020 total proved reserves increased by 23 tcfe or 13 compared to 2019 due to extensions discoveries and other additions of 3446 bcfe and the acquisition of 1381 bcfe from the chevron acquisition partly offset by production of 1498 bcfe revisions to previous estimates of 739 bcfe and divestitures of 257 bcfe we have an additional 13 tcfe of reserves that meet the definition of proved reserves except they are planned to be developed beyond five years and are therefore not included in the current estimate of proved reserves 

during 2020 we conducted a study of our reserves areas to determine the reliability of the technology used in calculating our reserves this study demonstrated that technologies used in the course of our reserves determination are reliable provide reasonable certainty of future performance and economics of our wells and conform to booking practices when using reliable technologies the technologies used in the estimation of our proved reserves include but are not limited to empirical evidence through drilling results and well performance production data decline curve analysis well logs geologic maps core data seismic data demonstrated relationship between geologic parameters and performance and the implementation and application of statistical analysis 

proved undeveloped reserves increased by 1136 bcfe or 23 in 2020 from 2019 the following table provides a rollforward of our proved undeveloped reserves 



a composed of i negative revisions of 510 bcfe from proved undeveloped locations that are no longer expected to be developed within five years of initial booking as proved reserves as a result of changes to our development plan which inc luded 245 bcfe from lower pricing that impacted well economics shifting capital from the ohio utica to pennsylvania and west virginia marcellus and 265 bcfe as a result of continued implementation of our combodevelopment strategy and ii positive revisions of 155 bcfe due primarily to changes in working interests and net revenue interests as well as revisions to type curves 

b composed of i 2096 bcfe of proved undeveloped additions associated with acreage that was previously unproved but became proved using reliable technologies which expanded the number of our technically proven locations ii 1295 bcfe due to additions 

table of contents 

associated with directly offsetting development and ii 31 bcfe from the extension of lateral lengths of proved undeveloped reserves 

as of december 31 2020 we had zero wells with proved undeveloped reserves that had remained undeveloped for more than five years from their time of booking 

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the preparation of and yearoveryear changes in our reserves estimate and calculation of our standardized measure of estimated future net cash flows from natural gas and crude oil reserves 

as of december 31 2020 the standardized measure of our estimated future net cash flows from natural gas and crude oil reserves which is calculated using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months which is referred to as sec pricing was 3366 million as described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements if the prices used in the calculation of the standardized measure instead reflected fiveyear strip pricing as of december 31 2020 and held constant thereafter using i the nymex fiveyear strip adjusted for regional differentials using texas eastern transmission corp m2 for gas and ii the nymex wti fiveyear strip for oil adjusted for regional differentials consistent with those used in the standardized measure and with all other assumptions held constant our total proved reserves would be 20296 bcfe the standardized measure of our discounted net future cash flows after taxes of our proved reserves would be 8952 million and the discounted future net cash flows before taxes would be 10152 million the average realized product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties would be 2718 per barrel of oil 1355 per barrel of ngl and 2075 per mcf of gas as compared to 2094 per barrel of oil 1197 per barrel of ngl and 138 per mcf of gas using sec pricing as described in note 18 the nymex strip price proved reserves and related metrics are intended to illustrate reserve sensitivities to market expectations of commodity prices and should not be confused with “sec pricing” proved reserves and do not comply with sec pricing assumptions we believe that the presentation of reserve volumes and related metrics using nymex forward strip prices provides investors with additional useful information about our reserves because the forward prices are based on the market’s forwardlooking expectations of oil and gas prices as of a certain date the price at which we can sell our production in the future is the major determinant of the likely economic producibility of our reserves we hedge substantial amounts of future production based upon futures prices in addition we use such forwardlooking marketbased data in developing our drilling plans assessing our capital expenditure needs and projecting future cash flows while nymex strip prices represent a consensus estimate of future pricing such prices are only an estimate and not necessarily an accurate projection of future oil and gas prices actual future prices may vary significantly from the nymex prices therefore actual revenue and value generated may be more or less than the amounts disclosed investors should be careful to consider forward prices in addition to and not as a substitute for sec pricing when considering our reserves 

based on our mix of proved undeveloped and probable reserves we estimate that we have an undeveloped drilling inventory of approximately 1660 net locations in pennsylvania and west virginia marcellus at our current drilling pace these net locations provide more than 15 years of drilling inventory based on net undeveloped marcellus acres average expected lateral length of 12000 feet and well spacing of 1000 feet we believe that our combodevelopment strategy coupled with our undeveloped inventory located in a premier core asset base will lead to sustainable free cash flow generation and higher returns on invested capital

the following table summarizes our net development wells drilled there were no net productive or net dry exploratory wells drilled during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



a dry development wells are related primarily to noncore wells that we no longer plan to drill to depth or complete acquired wells with mechanical integrity issues and wells that have been plugged and abandoned due to future mining operations or mechanical integrity issues 

during 2020 we commenced drilling operations spud on 88 gross wells 84 net including 66 pennsylvania marcellus gross wells 65 net 17 west virginia marcellus gross wells 16 net and 5 ohio utica gross wells 3 net

markets and customers 

natural gas sales natural gas is a commodity and therefore we typically receive marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin is typically lower relative to nymex henry hub louisiana the location for pricing nymex natural gas futures as a result of increased supply of natural gas in the northeast united states to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices we hedge a portion of our forecasted natural gas production at for the most part nymex natural gas prices for information on our hedging strategy and our derivative instruments refer to commodity risk management in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

ngls sales we primarily sell ngls recovered from our natural gas production we primarily contract with markwest energy partners lp markwest to process our natural gas and extract from the produced natural gas heavier hydrocarbon streams consisting predominately of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline we also contract with markwest to market a portion of our ngls in addition we have contractual arrangements with williams ohio valley midstream llc to process our natural gas and market a portion of our ngls 

  

average sales price the following table presents our average sales price per unit of natural gas ngls and oil with and without the effects of cash settled derivatives as applicable 



for additional information on pricing see average realized price reconciliation in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas marketing eqt energy llc our indirect whollyowned marketing subsidiary provides marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management services primarily for our benefit eqt energy llc also engages in risk management and hedging activities to limit our exposure to shifts in market prices 

table of contents 

customers we sell natural gas and ngls to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets that are accessible through our transportation portfolio particularly where there is expected future demand growth such as in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states and canada as of december 31 2020 approximately 60 of our sales volumes reach markets outside of appalachia we do not depend on any single customer and believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas ngls and oil 

we have access to approximately 25 bcf per day of firm pipeline takeaway capacity and 09 bcf per day of firm processing capacity in addition we are committed to an initial 129 bcf per day of firm capacity on the mountain valley pipeline upon its inservice date these firm transportation and processing agreements may require minimum volume delivery commitments which we expect to principally fulfill with production from existing reserves 

we have contractually agreed to deliver firm quantities of gas and ngls to various customers which we expect to fulfill with production from existing reserves we regularly monitor our proved developed reserves to ensure sufficient availability to meet commitments for the next one to three years the following table summarizes our total gross commitments as of december 31 2020 



seasonality 

generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers may also impact demand 

competition 

  

other natural gas producers compete with us in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and ngls and the securing of services labor equipment and transportation required to conduct operations our competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies individual producers operators and marketing companies and other energy companies that produce substitutes for the commodities that we produce 

regulation 

  

regulation of our operations our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the following the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas resources 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the following regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties ohio and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia we must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus and upper devonian acreage in pennsylvania lease integration legislation authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas various states also impose certain regulatory requirements to transfer wells to third parties or discontinue operations in the event of divestitures by us 

table of contents 

we maintain limited gathering operations that are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including the following air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations including regulations by the department of transportations pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

in 2010 congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation among other things the doddfrank act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivative activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act have yet to be adopted regulators have issued numerous rules under the doddfrank act including a rule establishing an “enduser” exception to mandatory clearing enduser exception a rule regarding margin for certain uncleared swaps margin rule and a rule imposing federal position limits on certain futures contracts relating to energy products including natural gas position limits rule 

we qualify as a “nonfinancial entity” for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for such exception as a result our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing although we are subject to certain recordkeeping and reporting obligations associated with such rule we also qualify as a “nonfinancial end user” for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally although the position limits rule does not go into effect with respect to energy products until january 1 2022 we believe that the majority if not all of our hedging activities constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and will not be subject to the limitations under such rule however many of our hedge counterparties and other market participants are not eligible for the enduser exception are subject to mandatory clearing and the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties and may be subject to the position limits rule which may affect the pricing andor availability of derivatives for us in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

regulators periodically review or audit our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements we anticipate that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on us 

the following is a summary of some of the existing laws rules and regulations to which our business operations are subject 

natural gas sales and transportation the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by the ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation the fercs regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transportation in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production the ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales which include all of our sales of our own production under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties of over 1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation while our production activities have not been regulated by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga we are required to report aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale 

table of contents 

to the extent such transactions use contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices in addition congress may enact legislation or the ferc may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise nonferc jurisdictional facilities to further regulation failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability 

the cftc also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including natural gas ngls and oil with regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake we are thus required to observe antimarket manipulation and disruptive trading practices laws and related regulations enforced by the ferc andor the cftc the cftc also holds substantial enforcement authority including the ability to assess civil penalties 

the ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 the ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nonunduly discriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company the fercs initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on our natural gasrelated activities 

under the fercs current regulatory regime transmission services must be provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates both of which are subject to ferc approval the ferc also allows jurisdictional gas pipeline companies to charge marketbased rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive gathering service which occurs upstream of fercjurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters section 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga although the ferc has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a nonjurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function the fercs determinations as to the classification of facilities are done on a casebycase basis to the extent that the ferc issues an order that reclassifies certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities and depending on the scope of that decision our costs of transporting gas to point of sale locations may increase we believe that the thirdparty natural gas pipelines on which our gas is gathered meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company however the distinction between the fercregulated transportation services and federally unregulated gathering services could be subject to potential litigation so the classification and regulation of those gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatorytake requirements although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 

oil and ngls price controls and transportation rates sales prices of oil and ngls are not currently regulated and are made at market prices our sales of these commodities are however subject to laws and to regulations issued by the federal trade commission ftc prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market the ftc holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations including the ability to assess civil penalties of over 1 million per day per violation our sales of these commodities and any related hedging activities are also subject to cftc oversight as discussed above 

the price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market some of our transportation of oil and ngls is through fercregulated interstate common carrier pipelines effective as of january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations the fercs regulation of crude oil and ngls transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipelines although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry the ferc published the fiveyear index level for 20212026 in december 2020 we are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or ferc proceedings if any on the transportation costs associated with crude oil production from our crude oil producing operations

environmental health and safety regulation our business operations are also subject to numerous stringent federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment we must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing operating and plugging and abandoning wells and related facilities violations of these laws can result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands and other protected areas or areas with endangered or threatened species restrictions require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production 

moreover the trend has been for stricter regulation of activities that have the potential to affect the environment additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by congress federal agencies the states local governments and the courts we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective therefore we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance the regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability we have established procedures however for the ongoing evaluation of our operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to track compliance with regulatory policies and procedures 

the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and workplace safety laws and regulations as amended from time to time to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition earnings or cash flows 

hazardous substances and waste handling the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment these persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in addition despite the petroleum exclusion of section 10114 of cercla which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances based on their characteristics however we are unaware of any liabilities arising under cercla for which we may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect us 

the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws establish detailed requirements for the generation handling storage treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes rcra specifically excludes drilling fluids produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes however these wastes may be regulated by the epa or state agencies under rcras less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions or under state laws or other federal laws moreover it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future in april 2019 following litigation and a resulting consent decree related to the epas requirements under rcra to review oil and gas waste regulations the epa determined that revisions to the regulations were not required concluding that any adverse effects related to oil and gas waste were more appropriately and readily addressed within the framework of existing state regulatory programs any changes to state or federal programs could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose waste which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we currently own lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for many years although we believe that we have used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on under or from other locations including offsite locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal in addition some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous 

table of contents 

owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control we are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act or have acted as operator the failure of a prior owner or operator to comply with applicable environmental regulations may in certain circumstances be attributed to us as current owner or operator under cercla these properties and the substances disposed or released on under or from them may be subject to cercla rcra and analogous state laws under such laws we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures regardless of fault which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or waste pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 

water discharges the federal water pollution control act or the clean water act cwa and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes into federal and state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or a state equivalent agency the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters including wetlands is also prohibited unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers corps in june 2015 the epa and the corps issued a final rule defining the scope of the epas and the corps jurisdiction over waters of the united states wotus which was stayed nationwide in october 2015 pending resolution of several legal challenges the epa and the corps proposed a rule in july 2017 to repeal the wotus rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the cwas jurisdiction in january 2018 the us supreme court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the wotus rule resides with the federal district courts which lifted the stay and resulted in a patchwork application of the rule in some states but not in others in october 2019 the epa issued a final rule repealing the wotus rule and the repeal rule became effective in december 2019 in april 2020 the epa and the corps published the navigable waters protection rule nwpr which narrowed the definition of wotus to four categories of jurisdictional waters and includes twelve categories of exclusions including groundwater a coalition of states and cities environmental groups and agricultural groups have challenged the nwpr and a federal district court in colorado stayed implementation of the rule the stay is limited to application of the rule in colorado the rule has taken effect in all other states in addition in an april 2020 decision defining the scope of the cwa that was handed down just days after the nwpr was published the us supreme court held that in certain cases discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the cwa and require a permit the court rejected the epa and corps’ assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the cwa the court’s decision is expected to bolster challenges to the nwpr on january 20 2021 the biden administration announced it will review the nwpr in accordance with the january 20 2021 executive order that revokes president trump’s executive order 13778 which required review and reversal of the wotus rule the epa and the corps have requested to stay the litigation over the nwpr during the agencies’ review of the rule to the extent a revised rule expands the scope of the cwas jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas which could delay the development of our natural gas and oil projects also pursuant to these laws and regulations we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or stormwater and to develop and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc plans in connection with onsite storage of significant quantities of oil these laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal remediation and damages 

air emissions the federal clean air act caa and comparable state laws regulate the emission of air pollutants from many sources such as for example tank batteries and compressor stations through air emissions standards construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements these laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre‑approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants the costs of which could be significant the need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects over the next several years we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissionsrelated issues reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new facilities or modify existing facilities in any newly designated nonattainment areas compliance with more stringent standards and other environmental regulations could delay or prohibit our ability to obtain permits for our operations or require us to install additional pollution control equipment the costs of which could be significant 

climate change and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases ghg present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that among other things establish prevention of significant deterioration psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal or criteria pollutant emissions facilities required to obtain psd permits for their 

table of contents 

ghg emissions are required to meet best available control technology standards established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a case‑by‑case basis these caa requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources in addition the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of our operations 

in june 2016 the epa finalized new regulations that established new source performance standards nsps known as subpart ooooa for methane and volatile organic compounds voc from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities in september 2020 the epa finalized amendments to the 2016 subpart ooooa standards known as the reconsideration rule that reduce the 2016 rules fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expand exceptions to pneumatic pump requirements among other changes various industry and environmental groups have separately challenged both the methane requirements and the epas attempts to delay the implementation of the rule in addition in april 2018 several states filed a lawsuit seeking to compel the epa to issue methane performance standards for existing sources in the oil and natural gas source category in september 2020 the epa issued a rule to revise subpart ooooa to rescind the methanespecific requirements for certain oil and natural gas sources in the production and processing segments known as the review rule both the reconsideration rule and the review rule are subject to pending litigation on january 20 2021 president biden issued an executive order directing the epa to rescind the reconsideration rule by september 2021 and consider revising the review rule as a result of the actions described above we cannot predict with certainty the scope of any final methane regulations or the costs for complying with federal methane regulations 

at the state level several states have proceeded with regulation targeting ghg emissions for example in june 2018 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep released revised versions of gp5 and gp5a pennsylvanias general air permits applicable to processing plants and well site operations among other facilities these permits apply to new or modified sources constructed on or after august 8 2018 with emissions below certain specified thresholds gp5 and gp5a impose best available technology bat standards which are in addition to and in many cases more stringent than the federal nsps these bat standards include a 200 ton per year limit on methane emissions above which a bat requirement for methane emissions control applies moreover in may 2020 the pennsylvania environmental quality board eqb published in the pennsylvania bulletin a proposed rulemaking for the control of emissions of vocs and other pollutants for existing sources eqb accepted public comments on the proposed rulemaking through july 2020 however a final rulemaking has yet to be approved by the eqb state regulations such as these could impose increased compliance costs on our operations 

while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of capandtrade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting ghgs in october 2019 pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed an executive order directing the padep to draft regulations establishing a capandtrade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions with the intent of enabling pennsylvania to join the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi a multistate regional capandtrade program comprised of several eastern us states in september 2020 the eqb approved promulgation of the rggi regulation and a public comment period and hearings regarding the regulation commenced at the end of 2020 based on the current timeline for implementation final rulemaking is expected to be sent to the eqb for review and approval in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the first year of compliance anticipated to begin in 2022 assuming pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of the rggi in 2022 as currently anticipated it will result in increased operating costs if we are required to purchase emission allowances in connection with our operations 

on an international level the united states is one of almost 200 nations that in december 2015 agreed to an international climate change agreement in paris france that calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its ghg emissions targets paris agreement the paris agreement was signed by the united states in april 2016 and entered into force on november 4 2016 however the paris agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants in august 2017 the us department of state officially informed the united nations of the united states intent to withdraw from the paris agreement with such withdrawal becoming effective in november 2020 however on january 20 2021 president biden issued written notification to the united nations of the united states’ intention to rejoin the paris agreement which will become effective in 30 days from such date 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated 

table of contents 

with our operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves 

notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change the international energy agency estimates that natural gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades in large part driven by the fact that natural gas produces significantly less co2 compared to other fossil fuels  up to 50 less than coal and 2030 less than oil according to the us energy information administration nonetheless recent activism directed at shifting funding away from fossil fuel companies could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations 

hydraulic fracturing activities vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in our industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers our well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations we conduct baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of our drilling pads 

hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act sdwa over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and issued permitting guidance in february 2014 regarding such activities the epa also finalized rules in june 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and after a legal challenge by environmental groups in july 2019 the epa declined to revise the rules 

congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities for example in january 2016 the padep issued new rules establishing stricter disposal requirements for wastes associated with hydraulic fracturing activities which include among other things a requirement to obtain new permits or closure of centralized impoundments used for the storage of drill cuttings and waste fluids further these rules include requirements relating to storage tank security secondary containment for storage vessels construction rules for gathering lines and horizontal drilling under streams and temporary transport lines for freshwater and wastewater additionally in january 2020 the eqb approved a well permit fee increase from 5000 to 12500 for all unconventional wells local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells 

occupational safety and health act we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha as amended and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees in addition oshas hazard communication standard the emergency planning and community right to know act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

summary of risk factors 

we believe that the risks associated with our business and consequently the risks associated with an investment in our equity or debt securities fall within the following six categories 

• risks associated with natural gas drilling operations as a natural gas producer there are risks inherent in our primary business operations these risks are not necessarily unique to us but rather these are risks that most operators in our industry have at least some exposure to 

• financial and market risks given that our primary product and source of revenue is the sale of natural gas and ngls one of our most material risks is the commodity market and the price of natural gas and ngls which is often volatile additionally our operations are capital intensive pressures on the market as a whole or our specific financial 

table of contents 

position – whether due to depressed commodity prices our leverage our credit ratings or otherwise – could make it difficult for us to obtain the funding necessary to conduct our operations 

• risks associated with our human capital technology and other resources and service providers our business and the us energy grid is predominately operated on a digital system our employees rely on our cloudbased digital work environment to communicate and access data that is necessary to conduct our daytoday operations while these digital systems enable us to efficiently supply our natural gas and ngls to the market they are also susceptible to cyber security threats likewise as a digitallyfocused organization we seek employees with a high degree of both technical skill and digital literacy and it can be difficult to attract and retain personnel who satisfy these criteria further we predominately operate in the appalachia basin and a substantial majority of our midstream and water services are provided by one provider eqm midstream partners lp making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area and obtaining a substantial amount of our services from a single provider within that operating area 

• legal and regulatory risks there are many environmental energy financial real property and other regulations that we are required to comply with in the context of conducting our operations otherwise we may be exposed to fines penalties investigations litigation or other legal proceedings additionally negative public perception of us or the natural gas industry or increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

• risks associated with strategic transactions we have historically been involved in and anticipate that we will continue to explore opportunities to create value through strategic transactions whether through mergers and acquisitions divestitures joint ventures or similar business transactions there are risks inherent in any strategic transaction and such risks could negatively affect the benefits outcomes and synergies anticipated to be obtained from executing such strategic transactions 

• risks related to the covid19 pandemic while we did not experience any material adverse effects from the covid19 pandemic in 2020 the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic is still uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict we believe that our principal areas of operational risk resulting from a pandemic are availability of service providers and supply chain disruption additionally active development operations including drilling and fracking operations represent the greatest risk for transmission given the number of personnel and contractors on our drilling sites we believe that we are following best practices under covid19 guidance however the potential for transmission still exists and in certain instances it may be necessary or determined advisable for us to delay our development operations 

we describe these risks in greater detail below 

risks associated with natural gas drilling operations 

drilling for and producing natural gas is a highrisk and costly activity with many uncertainties our future financial position cash flows and results of operations will depend on the success of our development and acquisition activities which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable natural gas production or that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in drilled wells 

many factors may curtail delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects including the following 

• delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including limitations resulting from permitting wastewater disposal discharge of greenhouse gases and limitations on hydraulic fracturing 

• shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment rigs materials and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities 

• equipment failures accidents or other unexpected operational events 

• lack of available gathering and water facilities or delays in construction of gathering and water facilities 

• lack of available capacity on interconnecting transportation pipelines 

• adverse weather conditions such as flooding droughts freezeoffs slips blizzards and ice storms 

• issues related to compliance with environmental regulations 

• environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks oil and diesel spills pipeline and tank ruptures encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized discharges of brine well stimulation and completion fluids toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment 

table of contents 

• declines in natural gas ngls and oil market prices 

• limited availability of financing at acceptable terms 

• ongoing litigation or adverse court rulings 

• public opposition to our operations 

• title surface access coal mining and right of way problems and 

• limitations in the market for natural gas ngls and oil 

any of these risks can cause a delay in our development program or result in substantial financial losses personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells and facilities 

our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to drilling for producing transporting and storing natural gas ngls and oil such as fires explosions slips landslides blowouts and well cratering pipe and other equipment and system failures delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities adverse weather conditions such as freeze offs of wells and pipelines due to cold weather issues related to compliance with environmental regulations environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks oil and diesel spills pipeline and tank ruptures encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized releases of brine well stimulation and completion fluids toxic gases or other pollutants into the environment especially those that reach surface water or groundwater inadvertent thirdparty damage to our assets and natural disasters we also face various risks or threats to the operation and security of our or third parties facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants compressor stations and pipelines any of these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property equipment and natural resources pollution or other environmental damage loss of hydrocarbons disruptions to our operations regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of our operations repair and remediation costs and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable and we may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

our drilling locations are scheduled out over many years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of when they are drilled if at all 

our management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain well locations as an estimation of our future multiyear drilling activities on our existing acreage these well locations represent a significant part of our business strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including natural gas ngls and oil prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs the availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations topography gathering system and pipeline transportation costs and constraints access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems coordination with coal mining regulatory approvals and other factors because of these uncertain factors we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas ngls or oil from these or any other drilling locations in addition unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained the leases for such acreage will expire further certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling or unitization with adjacent leaseholds controlled by third parties if these third parties are unwilling to pool or unitize such leaseholds with ours the total locations we can drill may be limited as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified 

failure to timely develop our leased real property could result in increased capital expenditures andor impairment of our leases 

mineral rights are typically owned by individuals who may enter into property leases with us to allow for the development of natural gas such leases expire after an initial term typically five years unless certain actions are taken to preserve the lease if

we cannot preserve a lease the lease terminates approximately 16 of our net undeveloped acres are subject to leases that could expire over the next three years lack of access to capital changes in government regulations changes in future development plans reduced drilling activity or the reduction in the fair value of undeveloped properties in the areas in which we operate could impact our ability to preserve trade or sell our leases prior to their expiration resulting in the termination and impairment of leases for properties that we have not developed 

we evaluate capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties at least annually to determine recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded lease impairments and expirations of 3067 million 5564 million and 2797 million respectively refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

our inability to cure any title defects in our leases in a timely and costefficient manner may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

the amount and timing of actual future natural gas ngls and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

because the rate of production from natural gas and oil wells and associated ngls generally declines as reserves are depleted our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngls and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that perform below expectations or do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit low natural gas ngls and oil prices may further limit the types of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced future natural gas ngls and oil production therefore is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable we cannot be certain that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with efficient operation of existing wells our reserves and production together with associated revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs some of which are beyond our control these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows to the extent we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved although we believe our estimates are reasonable actual production revenues and costs to develop reserves will likely vary from estimates and these variances could be material numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves 

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelvemonth unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil the amount timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves and thus their actual present value in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our operations or the natural gas ngls and oil industry in general 

natural gas ngls and oil price declines and changes in our development strategy have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including longlived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations because the results are based on estimated future events and estimated future cash flows the estimated future cash flows used to test our proved oil and gas properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by our management for internal planning and budgeting purposes key assumptions used in our analyses include among other things the intended use of the asset the anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil future operating costs inflation and the anticipated proceeds that may be received upon divestiture if there is a possibility that the asset will be divested prior to the end of its useful life commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality locational basis adjustments and inflation proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

future declines in natural gas ngls or oil prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance among other circumstances may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves andor could result in additional noncash impairment charges to writedown the carrying amount of our assets including other longlived intangible assets which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods any impairment of our assets including other longlived intangible assets would require us to take an immediate charge to earnings such charges could be material to our results of operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position see impairment of oil and gas properties in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

financial and market risks applicable to our business 

natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position 

our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position depend upon the prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent ngls and oil the prices for natural gas ngls and oil have historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include 

• weather conditions and seasonal trends 

• the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for natural gas ngls and oil 

• prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices 

table of contents 

• national and worldwide economic and political conditions 

• new and competing exploratory finds of natural gas ngls and oil 

• changes in us exports of natural gas ngls and oil 

• the effect of energy conservation efforts 

• the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 

• the availability proximity capacity and cost of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices 

• technological advances affecting energy consumption and production 

• the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 

• the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets including commodity price speculators and others 

• the cost of exploring for developing producing and transporting natural gas ngls and oil 

• the level of global inventories 

• risks associated with drilling completion and production operations and 

• domestic local and foreign governmental regulations tariffs and taxes including environmental and climate change regulation 

the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 314 per mmbtu to a low of 133 per mmbtu from january 1 2020 through december 31 2020 and the daily spot prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 6327 per barrel to a low of 3698 per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast united states because our production and reserves predominantly consist of natural gas approximately 93 of equivalent proved developed reserves changes in natural gas prices have significantly greater impact on our financial results than oil prices ngls are made up of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics which adds further volatility to the pricing of ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil at our ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations 

prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas ngls and oil prices may adversely affect our revenues operating income cash flows and financial position particularly if we are unable to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngls and oil prices declines in prices could also adversely affect our drilling activities and the amount of natural gas ngls and oil that we can produce economically which may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur noncash impairment charges to earnings reductions in cash flows from lower commodity prices may require us to incur additional borrowings or to reduce our capital spending which could reduce our production and our reserves negatively affecting our future rate of growth lower prices for natural gas ngls and oil may also adversely affect our credit ratings and result in a reduction in our borrowing capacity and access to other capital see impairment of oil and gas properties in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in our derivative contracts having a positive fair value in our favor further adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our hedge counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection 

increases in natural gas ngls and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral provided to our hedge counterparties which is interestbearing is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we will not benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

we may not be able to successfully execute our plan to deleverage our business or otherwise reduce our debt level 

in an effort to improve our leverage ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced a plan to reduce our absolute debt using free cash flow and targeted proceeds from the monetization of select nonstrategic exploration and production assets core mineral assets and our remaining retained equity interest in equitrans midstream the deleveraging plan there can be no 

table of contents 

assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient free cash flow or find attractive asset monetization opportunities or that any such transactions will be completed on our anticipated timeframe if at all which would delay or inhibit our ability to successfully execute our deleveraging plan furthermore our estimated value for the assets to be monetized under our deleveraging plan involves multiple assumptions and judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain accordingly there can be no assurance that the resulting net cash proceeds from asset monetization transactions will be as anticipated even if such transactions are consummated some of the factors that could affect our ability to successfully execute our deleveraging plan include changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers and the availability of financing to potential purchasers on reasonable terms the number of prospective purchasers the number of competing assets on the market unfavorable economic conditions industry trends and changes in laws and regulations if we are not able to successfully execute our deleveraging plan or otherwise reduce our absolute debt to a level we believe appropriate our credit ratings may be lowered we may reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or investments and we may revise or delay our strategic plans 

our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms 

our business is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the development and acquisition of natural gas ngls and oil reserves we typically fund our capital expenditures with existing cash and cash generated by operations and to the extent our capital expenditures exceed our cash resources from borrowings under our credit facility and other external sources of capital if we do not have sufficient borrowing availability under our credit facility we may seek alternate debt or equity financing sell assets or reduce our capital expenditures the issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of among other things natural gas prices actual drilling results the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory technological and competitive developments 

our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

• our level of proved reserves and production 

• the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells 

• our access to and the cost of accessing end markets for our production 

• the prices at which our production is sold 

• our ability to acquire locate and produce new reserves 

• the levels of our operating expenses and 

• our ability to access the public or private capital markets or borrow under our credit facility 

if our cash flows from operations or the borrowing capacity under our credit facility are insufficient to fund our capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain the capital necessary for our planned capital budget or our operations we could be required to curtail our operations and the development of our properties which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

as of december 31 2020 our senior notes were rated ba3 with a positive outlook by moodys investors services moodys bb with a stable outlook by standard  poors ratings service sp and bb with a positive outlook by fitch ratings service fitch although we are not aware of any current plans of moodys sp or fitch to downgrade its rating of our senior notes we cannot be assured that one or more of these rating agencies will not downgrade or withdraw entirely its rating of our senior notes low prices for natural gas ngls and oil an increase in the level of our indebtedness or a failure to significantly execute our deleveraging plan may result in moodys sp or fitch downgrading its rating of our senior notes changes in credit ratings may affect our access to the capital markets the cost of shortterm debt through interest rates and fees under our lines of credit the interest rate on the adjustable rate notes defined in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the rates available on new longterm debt our pool of investors and funding sources the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on our otc derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements including collateral in support of our midstream service contracts joint venture arrangements or construction contracts 

table of contents 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 4925 million of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

• require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities 

• limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on incurring additional debt making certain investments and paying dividends 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations 

• depending on the levels of our outstanding debt limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate and other purposes and 

• increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy including declines in prices for natural gas ngls and oil 

our debt agreements also require compliance with certain covenants if the price that we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance for more information about our debt agreements read capital resources and liquidity in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks 

our business and operating results can be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or other increases in the cost of capital resulting from a reduction in our credit rating or otherwise these changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce cash flows used for operating and capital expenditures and place us at a competitive disadvantage 

disruptions or volatility in the financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve favorable operating results in addition we are exposed to credit risk related to our credit facility to the extent that one or more of our lenders may be unable to provide necessary funding to us under our existing line of credit if it experiences liquidity problems 

uncertainty related to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations 

loans to us under our credit facility may be base rate loans or libor loans libor is calculated by reference to a market for interbank lending and it is based on increasingly fewer actual transactions this increases the subjectivity of the libor calculation process and increases the risk of manipulation actions by the regulators or law enforcement agencies as well as ice benchmark administration the current administrator of libor may result in changes to the manner that libor is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates for example on july 27 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 us dollar libor will likely be replaced by the secured overnight financing rate sofr published by the federal reserve bank of new york however the timing of this shift is currently unknown sofr is an overnight rate instead of a term rate making sofr an inexact replacement for libor and there is not an established process to create robust forwardlooking sofr term rates changing the benchmark rate for libor loans from libor to sofr requires calculations of a spread industry organizations are attempting to structure the spread calculation in a manner that minimizes the possibility of value transfer between counterparties borrowers and lenders by the transition but there is no assurance that the calculated spread will be fair and accurate at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be implemented if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate our credit facility to determine the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established as such the potential effect of any such event on our interest expense cannot yet be determined

derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 

to manage our exposure to price risk we currently and may in the future enter into derivative arrangements utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a portion of our future production such hedges are designed to lock in prices in order to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow these transactions limit our potential gains if natural gas ngls and oil prices rise above the price established by the hedge in addition derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which 

• our production is less than expected 

• the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform on their contract obligations or 

• an event materially impacts natural gas ngls or oil prices or the relationship between the hedged price index and the natural gas ngls or oil sales price 

we cannot be certain that any derivative transaction we may enter into will adequately protect us from declines in the prices of natural gas ngls or oil furthermore where we choose not to engage in derivative transactions in the future we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas ngls or oil prices than our competitors who engage in derivative transactions lower natural gas ngls and oil prices may also negatively impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts at favorable prices 

derivative transactions also expose us to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract or enters bankruptcy or encounters some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint in this case we may not be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase which increases our exposure if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance we could incur a significant loss 

the accounting for the convertible notes may have a material effect on our reported financial results 

on april 28 2020 we issued the convertible notes defined in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements due may 1 2026 unless earlier redeemed repurchased or converted in accordance with gaap an issuer must separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost the effect on the accounting for the convertible notes is that the equity component is required to be included in additional paidin capital of shareholders equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as a debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible notes accordingly we will be required to record a greater amount of noncash interest expense in current and future periods as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount over the term of the convertible notes we will report lower net income or greater net loss in our financial results because gaap requires interest to include both the current periods amortization of the debt discount and the instruments coupon interest which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the convertible notes 

in addition because we have the ability and intent to settle the convertible notes upon conversion by paying or delivering cash equal to the principal amount of the obligation and common stock for amounts over the principal amount the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes are accounted for using the treasury stock method and as such are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible notes exceeds their principal amount further under the treasury stock method the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess are issued we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle in cash or that the accounting standards will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method if we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected 

risks associated with our human capital technology and other resources and service providers 

strategic determinations including the allocation of resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial position and reduce our future prospects 

our future prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business our operational strategy focuses on developing several multiwell pads in tandem through a process known as combodevelopment we have allocated a 

table of contents 

substantial portion of our financial human capital and other resources to pursuing this strategy including investing in new technologies and equipment restructuring our workforce and pursuing various esg initiatives geared towards enhancing our strategy we may not realize some or any of the anticipated strategic financial operational environmental and other anticipated benefits from our operational strategy and the corresponding investments we have made in pursuing our strategy additionally we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully execute combodevelopment projects at the pace and scale that we project which may delay or reduce our production and our reserves negatively affecting our associated revenues if we fail to identify and successfully execute optimal business strategies including the appropriate operational strategy and corresponding initiatives or fail to optimize our capital investments and the use of our other resources in furtherance of optimal business strategies our financial position and growth may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

cyber incidents targeting our digital work environment or other technologies or natural gas and oil industry systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations 

our business and the natural gas and oil industry in general have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies we depend on this technology to record and store data estimate quantities of natural gas ngls and oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers and mobile devices control nearly all of the natural gas ngls and oil distribution systems in the us which are necessary to transport our products to market 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our digital work environment or other technologies and infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas ngls and oil difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve and cyber attackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents the cost to remedy an unintended dissemination of sensitive information or data may be significant furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs completion services equipment supplies personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis 

the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations geologists geophysicists engineers and other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices causing periodic shortages or higher costs historically there have been shortages of personnel and equipment as demand for personnel and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

our ability to drill for and produce natural gas is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for drilling and completion operations and access to water and waste disposal or recycling services at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of produced water and other waste may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to drill and complete natural gas wells requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water our ability to access sources of water and the availability of disposal alternatives to receive all of the water produced from our wells and used in hydraulic fracturing may affect our drilling and completion operations our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations or to timely obtain water sourcing permits or other rights could adversely affect our operations additionally the imposition of new 

table of contents 

environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of waste which would adversely affect our business and results of operations which could result in decreased cash flows 

in addition federal and state regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for natural gas and oil waste disposal and increased seismic activity in certain areas in some cases operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity in the states where we operate could lead to restrictions on our disposal well injection volumes and increased scrutiny of and delay in obtaining new disposal well permits which could result in increased operating costs which could be material or a curtailment of our operations 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to identify attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with identifying attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot identify attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete in our industry could be harmed 

we depend on thirdparty midstream providers for a significant portion of our midstream services and our failure to obtain and maintain access to the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas ngls and oil to market on competitive terms may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

our delivery of natural gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities primarily owned by third parties and our ability to contract with these third parties at competitive rates or at all the capacity of transmission gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties competition for access to pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense and our ability to secure access to pipeline infrastructure on favorable economic terms could affect our competitive position 

we are dependent on thirdparty providers to provide us with access to midstream infrastructure to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market to the extent these services are delayed or unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production access to midstream assets may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may occur more slowly a lack of access to needed infrastructure or an extended interruption of access to or service from thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including vandalism terroristic acts sabotage or cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil 

finally in order to ensure access to certain midstream facilities we have entered into agreements that obligate us to pay demand charges to various pipeline operators we also have commitments with third parties for processing capacity we may be obligated to make payments under these agreements even if we do not fully use the capacity we have reserved and these payments may be significant 

the substantial majority of our midstream and water services are provided by one provider eqm midstream partners lp eqm a whollyowned subsidiary of equitrans midstream therefore any regulatory infrastructure or other events that materially adversely affect eqms business operations will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other thirdparty service providers additionally our midstream services contracts with eqm involve significant longterm financial and other commitments on our part which hinders our ability to diversify our slate of midstream service providers and seek better economic and other terms for the midstream services that are provided to us we have no control over equitrans midstreams or eqms business decisions and operations and neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors us 

historically we have received the substantial majority of our natural gas gathering transmission and storage and water services from eqm additionally on february 26 2020 we executed a new gas gathering agreement with eqm the consolidated 

table of contents 

gga which among other things consolidated the majority of our prior gathering agreements with eqm into a single agreement established a new fee structure for gathering and compression fees charged by eqm increased our minimum volume commitments with eqm committed certain of our remaining undedicated acreage to eqm and extended our and eqms contractual obligations with each other to 2035 because we have significant longterm contractual commitments with eqm we expect to receive the majority of our midstream and water services from eqm for the foreseeable future therefore any event whether in our areas of operation or otherwise that adversely affects eqms operations water assets pipelines other transportation facilities gathering and processing facilities financial condition leverage results of operations or cash flows will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other thirdparty service providers accordingly we are subject to the business risks of eqm including the following 

  

• federal state and local regulatory political and legal actions that could adversely affect eqms operations assets and infrastructure including potential further delays associated with obtaining regulatory approval for the construction of the mountain valley pipeline and the mvp southgate project 

• construction risks associated with the construction or repair of eqms pipelines and other midstream infrastructure such as delays caused by landowners or advocacy groups opposed to the natural gas industry environmental hazards adverse weather conditions the performance of thirdparty contractors the lack of available skilled labor equipment and materials and the inability to obtain necessary rightsofway or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all and maintain such rightsofway approvals and permits once obtained 

• acts of cybersecurity sabotage or terrorism that could cause significant damage or injury to eqms personnel assets or infrastructure or lead to extended interruptions of eqms operations 

• risks associated with eqm failing to properly balance supply and demand for its services on a shortterm seasonal and longterm basis which could result in eqm being unable to provide its customers including us with sufficient access to pipeline and other midstream infrastructure and water services as needed and 

• risks associated with eqms leverage and financial profile which could result in eqm being financially deterred or prohibited from providing services to its customers including us on a timely basis or at all 

in addition many of our midstream services obligations with eqm are firm commitments under which we have reserved an agreed upon amount of pipeline or storage capacity with eqm regardless of the capacity that we actually use during each month and we are generally obligated to pay a fixed monthly charge at an amount agreed upon in the contract because these obligations involve significant longterm financial and other commitments on our part they could reduce our cash flow during periods of low prices for natural gas ngls and oil when we may have lower volumes of natural gas and ngls and therefore less of a need for capacity and storage or the market prices for such pipeline and storage capacity services may be lower than what we are contractually obligated to pay to eqm 

further the consolidated gga provides for a reduced fee structure for the gathering and compression fees charged by eqm however this new fee structure does not take effect until the mountain valley pipelines inservice date there can be no assurance that the inservice date of the mountain valley pipeline will not be delayed or that the project will not be cancelled entirely which would consequently delay possibly indefinitely the effective date of the fee reductions contemplated in the consolidated gga neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to renegotiate their contracts with us including the consolidated gga in the event of a prolonged depressed commodity price environment or if the mountain valley pipelines inservice date is delayed we have recorded in our consolidated balance sheet a contract asset of 410 million representing the estimated fair value of the rate relief provided by the consolidated gga that would be realized beginning with the mountain valley pipeline’s inservice date we review the contract asset for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable although the consolidated gga provides a cash payment option that grants us the right to receive payments from eqm in the event that the mountain valley pipeline inservice date has not occurred prior to january 1 2022 future delays in the mountain valley pipeline’s inservice date may nonetheless affect our ability to fully realize the value we recorded as a contract asset for the rate relief associated with the consolidated gga which could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

substantially all of our producing properties are concentrated in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area 

substantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the appalachian basin as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by and costs associated with governmental regulation state and local political activities processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations availability of equipment and personnel water shortages or other weatherrelated conditions interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas 

table of contents 

ngls or oil and changes in state and local laws judicial precedents political regimes and regulations such conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in addition a number of areas within the appalachian basin have historically been subject to mining operations for example third parties may engage in subsurface coal and other mining operations near or under our properties which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties adversely impact our drilling operations or adversely impact thirdparty midstream activities on which we rely in such event our operations may be impaired or interrupted and we may not be able to recover the costs incurred as a result of temporary shutins or the plugging and abandonment of any of our wells furthermore the existence of mining operations near our properties could require coordination to avoid adverse impacts as a result of drilling and mining in close proximity these restrictions on our operations and any similar restrictions could cause delays or interruptions or prevent us from executing our business strategy which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

further insufficient takeaway capacity in the appalachian basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized natural gas prices the appalachian basin has experienced periods in which production has surpassed local takeaway capacity resulting in substantial discounts in the price received by producers such as us and others at times being possibly shut in although additional appalachian basin takeaway capacity has been added in recent years the existing and expected capacity may not be sufficient to keep pace with the increased production caused by accelerated drilling in the area in the short term 

due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties 

legal and regulatory risks 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

opposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activities generally has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the us and companies in our industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and nongovernmental organizations regarding safety human rights environmental matters sustainability and business practices negative public perception regarding us andor our industry may lead to increased litigation and regulatory legislative and judicial scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations in safety environmental royalty and surface use areas these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed challenged or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business in addition antidevelopment activists are working to among other things reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development if activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development persists or increases there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to complex federal state local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities 

our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of water and other fluids and materials including solid and hazardous wastes incidental to natural gas and oil operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of properties some states allow the statutory pooling and unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration as well as joint 

table of contents 

development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and natural gas and oil laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air ground and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed and work practices related to employee health and safety 

to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits approvals and certificates from various federal state and local governmental authorities maintaining compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas ngls and oil resources these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages in addition our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations such costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages as well as corrective action costs 

changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely impact our earnings and the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our operations 

effective january 1 2018 changes to certain us federal income tax laws were signed into law that impact us including but not limited to changes to the regular income tax rate the elimination of the alternative minimum tax amt full expensing of capital equipment limited deductibility of interest expense and increased limitations on deductible executive compensation on march 27 2020 the us congress enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act which among other things includes provisions relating to net operating loss nol carryback periods amt credit refunds and modifications to the net interest deduction limitations in particular under the cares act i for taxable years beginning before 2021 nol carryforwards and carrybacks may offset 100 of taxable income ii nols arising in 2018 2019 and 2020 taxable years may be carried back to each of the preceding five years to generate a refund and iii for taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020 the base for interest deductibility is increased from 30 to 50 of ebitda 

members of congress periodically introduce legislation to revise us federal income tax laws which could have a material impact on us the most significant potential tax law changes that could impact us include increases in the regular income tax rate a new minimum tax based on net income the expensing of intangible drilling costs or percentage depletion the repeal of likekind exchange tax deferral rules on real property and further limited deductibility of interest expense any of which could adversely impact our current and deferred federal and state income tax liabilities state and local taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate or own assets may enact new taxes such as the imposition of a severance tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce natural gas ngls and oil or change the rates of existing taxes which could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

our hedging activities are subject to numerous and evolving financial laws and regulations which could inhibit our ability to effectively hedge our production against commodity price risk or increase our cost of compliance 

we use financial derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas ngls and oil prices on our results of operations and cash flows in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank act which established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors prudential regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation among other things the doddfrank act established margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivative activities although some of the rules necessary to implement the doddfrank act have yet to be adopted the cftc the sec and prudential regulators have issued numerous rules including the enduser exception which exempts certain “endusers” from having to comply with mandatory clearing a margin rule mandating margining for certain uncleared swaps and a position limits rule imposing federal position limits on certain futures contracts relating to energy products including natural gas 

table of contents 

we qualify as a “nonfinancial entity” for purposes of the enduser exception and as such we are eligible for such exception as a result our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing although we are subject to certain recordkeeping and reporting obligations associated with such rule we also qualify as a “nonfinancial end user” for purposes of the margin rule therefore our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements finally although the position limits rule does not go into effect with respect to energy products until january 1 2022 we believe that the majority if not all of our hedging activities constitute bona fide hedging under the position limits rule and will not be subject to the limitations under such rule however many of our hedge counterparties and other market participants are not eligible for the enduser exception are subject to mandatory clearing and the margin rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties and may be subject to the position limits rule which may affect the pricing andor availability of derivatives for us in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives collectively foreign regulations which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such foreign regulations 

the doddfrank act the rules adopted thereunder and the foreign regulations could increase the cost of our derivative contracts alter the terms of our derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts lessen the number of available counterparties and in turn increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties if our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the doddfrank act related regulations or the foreign regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations we have experienced increased and anticipate additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing financial regulatory environment 

federal state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of natural gas and oil wells which could adversely affect our production 

we use hydraulic fracturing in the completion of our wells hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state natural gas and oil commissions but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority for example the epa finalized rules in june 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and after a legal challenge by environmental groups in july 2019 the epa declined to revise the rules 

certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells see businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation for more information 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these delays costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and workplace safety including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time resulting in longer waiting periods to receive permits and other regulatory approvals failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations 

strict joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those 

table of contents 

actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental and occupational health and workplace safety impacts of our operations we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such matters 

in addition new or additional laws and regulations new interpretations of existing requirements or changes in enforcement policies could impose unforeseen liabilities significantly increase compliance costs or result in delays of or denial of rights to conduct our development programs for example in june 2015 the epa and the corps issued a final rule under the cwa defining the scope of the epas and the corps jurisdiction over wotus which was stayed nationwide in october 2015 pending resolution of several legal challenges the epa and the corps proposed a rule in july 2017 to repeal the wotus rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the cwas jurisdiction in january 2018 the us supreme court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the wotus rule resides with the federal district courts which lifted the stay and resulted in a patchwork application of the rule in some states but not in others in october 2019 the epa issued a final rule repealing the wotus rule and the repeal rule became effective in december 2019 in april 2020 the epa and the corps published the nwpr which narrows the definition of wotus to four categories of jurisdictional waters and includes twelve categories of exclusions including groundwater a coalition of states and cities environmental groups and agricultural groups have challenged the nwpr and a federal district court in colorado stayed implementation of the rule the stay is limited to application of the rule in colorado the rule has taken effect in all other states in addition in an april 2020 decision defining the scope of the cwa that was handed down just days after the nwpr was published the us supreme court held that in certain cases discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the cwa and require a permit the court rejected the epa and corps’ assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the cwa the court’s decision is expected to bolster challenges to the nwpr on january 20 2021 the biden administration announced it will review the nwpr in accordance with the january 20 2021 executive order that revokes president trump’s executive order 13778 which required review and reversal of the wotus rule the epa and the corps have requested to stay the litigation over the nwpr during the agencies’ review of the rule to the extent a rule expands the scope of the cwas jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas such potential regulations or litigation could increase our operating costs reduce our liquidity delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position further the discharges of natural gas ngls oil and other pollutants into the air soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties 

regulations related to the protection of wildlife could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

our operations can be adversely affected by regulations designed to protect various wildlife the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in constraints on our exploration and production activities this limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 

fuel conservation measures consumer tastes and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil the impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas ngls and oil that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 

in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that among other things establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal or criteria pollutant emissions facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that will be established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a case‑by‑case basis these epa rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources in addition the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring 

table of contents 

and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of our operations at the state level several states including pennsylvania have proceeded with regulation targeting ghg emissions such state regulations could impose increased compliance costs on our operations 

while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of capandtrade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs in october 2019 pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed an executive order directing the padep to draft regulations establishing a capandtrade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions with the intent of enabling pennsylvania to join the rggi a multistate regional capandtrade program comprised of several eastern us states in september 2020 the pennsylvania environmental quality board approved promulgation of the rggi regulation and a public comment period and hearings regarding the regulation commenced at the end of 2020 based on the current timeline for implementation final rulemaking is expected to be sent to the pennsylvania environmental quality board for review and approval in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the first year of compliance anticipated to begin in 2022 assuming pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of the rggi in 2022 as currently anticipated it will result in increased operating costs if we are required to purchase emission allowances in connection with our operations 

on an international level the united states is one of almost 200 nations that in december 2015 agreed to the paris agreement which calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its ghg emissions targets the paris agreement was signed by the united states in april 2016 and entered into force on november 4 2016 however the paris agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants in august 2017 the us department of state officially informed the united nations of the united states intent to withdraw from the paris agreement with such withdrawal becoming effective in november 2020 however on january 20 2021 president biden issued written notification to the united nations of the united states’ intention to rejoin the paris agreement which will become effective in 30 days from such date 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the natural gas ngls and oil we produce and lower the value of our reserves 

further recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energyrelated assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations see businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation for more information 

risks associated with strategic transactions 

entering into strategic transactions may expose us to various risks 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory and thirdparty approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from these transactions competition for transaction opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing transactions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility 

table of contents 

moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little or partial control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

acquisitions may disrupt our current plans or operations and may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas ngls and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well or lease that we acquire and even when we inspect a well or lease we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the separation and distribution may subject us to future liabilities 

in november 2018 we completed the separation and distribution each defined and discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements resulting in the spinoff of equitrans midstream a standalone publicly traded corporation that holds our former midstream business 

pursuant to agreements we entered into with equitrans midstream in connection with the separation we and equitrans midstream are each generally responsible for the obligations and liabilities related to our respective businesses pursuant to those agreements we and equitrans midstream each agreed to crossindemnities principally designed to allocate financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business to us and those of equitrans midstreams business to it however third parties including governmental agencies could seek to hold us responsible for obligations and liabilities that equitrans midstream agreed to retain or assume and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from equitrans midstream will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities or that equitrans midstream will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations additionally if a court were to determine that the separation or related transactions were consummated with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in equitrans midstream receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent or that it was rendered insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and equitrans midstream impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us and void some or all of the separationrelated transactions any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

if there is a later determination that the distribution or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor opinion of counsel are incorrect or for any other reason significant liabilities could be incurred by us our shareholders or equitrans midstream 

in connection with the separation and distribution we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code as amended and certain other us federal income tax matters relating to the distribution and certain related transactions the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel are based on and rely on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us and equitrans midstream including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and equitrans midstream if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if we or equitrans midstream breach any representations or covenants contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter 

table of contents 

ruling andor the opinion of counsel we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel 

notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the ruling or for other reasons an opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in such opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we equitrans midstream and our shareholders could be subject to material us federal and state income tax liabilities in connection with the separation we and equitrans midstream entered into a tax matters agreement which described the sharing of any such liabilities between us and equitrans midstream 

we are a significant shareholder of equitrans midstream and the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may fluctuate substantially 

following the separation and distribution we retained approximately 199 of the outstanding shares of equitrans midstreams common stock on february 26 2020 we entered into share purchase agreements with equitrans midstream to sell approximately 50 of our equity interest in equitrans midstream to equitrans midstream the equitrans share exchange in exchange for a combination of cash and fee relief under our gathering agreements with eqm we currently own 25296026 shares of equitrans midstreams common stock the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may be adversely affected by negative changes in its results of operations cash flows and financial position which may occur as a result of the many risks attendant with operating in the midstream industry including loss of gathering and transportation volumes the effect of laws and regulations on the operation of its business and development of its assets increased competition loss of contracted volumes adverse ratemaking decisions policies and rulings by the ferc pipeline safety rulemakings initiated or finalized by the department of transportations pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration delays in the timing of or the failure to complete expansion projects lack of access to capital and operating risks and hazards 

we intend to dispose of our remaining interest in equitrans midstream through one or more divestitures of our shares of equitrans midstreams common stock however we can offer no assurance that we will be able to complete such disposition or as to the value we will realize the occurrence of any of these and other risks faced by equitrans midstream could adversely affect the value of our investment in equitrans midstream 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the novel coronavirus or covid19 pandemic has affected and may materially adversely affect and any future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases may materially adversely affect our operations financial performance and condition operating results and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has affected and may materially adversely affect our business and financial and operating results the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic is uncertain rapidly changing and hard to predict in 2020 the pandemic significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and in the future covid19 or another similar pandemic could negatively impact our business in numerous ways including but not limited to the following 

• our revenue may be reduced if the pandemic results in an economic downturn or recession that leads to a prolonged decrease in the demand for natural gas and to a lesser extent ngls and oil 

• our operations may be disrupted or impaired thus lowering our production level if a significant portion of our employees or contractors are unable to work due to illness or if our field operations are suspended or temporarily shutdown or restricted due to control measures designed to contain the pandemic 

• the operations of our midstream service providers on whom we rely for the transmission gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced natural gas ngls and oil may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing the pandemic andor the difficult economic environment may lead to the bankruptcy or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers which may result in substantial discounts in the prices 

table of contents 

we receive for our produced natural gas ngls and oil or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties and 

• the disruption and instability in the financial markets and the uncertainty in the general business environment may affect our ability to raise capital or find attractive asset monetization opportunities and successfully execute our deleveraging plan within our anticipated timeframe or at all 

we believe that our principal areas of operational risk resulting from a pandemic are availability of service providers and supply chain disruption active development operations including drilling and fracking operations represent the greatest risk for transmission given the number of personnel and contractors on site while we believe that we are following best practices under covid19 guidance the potential for transmission still exists in certain instances it may be necessary or determined advisable for us to delay development operations 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth herein such as those relating to our financial performance our ability to access capital and credit markets our credit ratings and debt obligations the rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 on our business which will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict including the length of time that the pandemic continues its effect on the demand for natural gas ngls and oil the response of the overall economy and the financial markets as well as the effect of governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic

net loss for 2020 was 967 million 371 per diluted share an improvement of 255 million compared to net loss for 2019 of 1222 million 479 per diluted share the variance was attributable primarily to decreased impairments the gain on the equitrans share exchange defined and discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements decreased other operating expenses decreased depreciation and depletion expense and decreased transportation and processing expense partly offset by decreased operating revenues increased interest expense and decreased dividend and other income

nongaap financial measures reconciliation 

the table below reconciles adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure with total operating revenues its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted operating revenues also referred to in this report as total natural gas and liquids sales including cash settled derivatives is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons of earnings trends adjusted operating revenues excludes the revenue impacts of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and net marketing services and other we use adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because as a result of the measures exclusion of the oftenvolatile changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts net marketing services and other primarily includes the costs of and recoveries on pipeline capacity releases because we consider net marketing services and other to be unrelated to our natural gas and liquids production activities adjusted operating revenues excludes net marketing services and other we believe that adjusted operating revenues provides useful information to investors for evaluating periodtoperiod comparisons of earnings trends 



sales volumes and revenues 



a includes upper devonian wells 

b ngls ethane and oil were converted to mcfe at a rate of six mcfe per barrel 

sales of natural gas ngls and oil sales of natural gas ngls and oil decreased for 2020 compared to 2019 due to a lower average realized price and lower sales volumes average realized price decreased due to lower nymex and unfavorable differential partly offset by higher cash settled derivatives for 2020 and 2019 we received 8988 million and 2663 million respectively of net cash settlements including net premiums received on derivatives not designated as hedges which are included in average realized price but may not be included in operating revenues sales volumes for 2020 decreased compared 

table of contents 

to 2019 due primarily to our strategic decisions to temporarily curtail production beginning in may 2020 and ending in november 2020 the strategic production curtailments which resulted in a decrease to sales volumes of approximately 46 bcfe sales volumes for 2020 also decreased compared to 2019 by 16 bcfe as a result of the 2020 divestitures defined in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements these decreases were partly offset by operational efficiencies realized throughout the year from increased production uptime and positively impacted sales volumes as well as an increase of approximately 12 bcfe due to the chevron acquisition 

gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for 2020 we recognized a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges of 4002 million compared to 6166 million for 2019 the gains for 2020 and 2019 were related primarily to decreases in the fair market value of our nymex swaps and options due to increases in nymex forward prices 

operating expenses 

the following table presents information on our productionrelated operating expenses 



gathering gathering expense increased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2020 compared to 2019 due to a higher gathering rate structure as a result of the consolidated gga defined in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements   partly offset by lower gathered volumes as a result of the strategic production curtailments we expect to realize fee relief and a lower gathering rate structure from the consolidated gga beginning on the mountain valley pipeline inservice date 

transmission transmission expense decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to released capacity on and credits received from the texas eastern transmission pipeline partly offset by higher costs associated with additional capacity on the tennessee gas pipeline 

loe loe increased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to higher repairs and maintenance costs as a result of our increased focus on optimizing production from currently producing wells as well as higher salt water disposal costs 

table of contents 

production taxes production taxes decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower severance taxes and pennsylvania impact fees as a result of lower commodity prices 

depreciation and depletion production depletion decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a lower annual depletion rate and lower volumes 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for 2020 was 260 million compared to 359 million for 2019 the decrease was due primarily to the impairment of intangible assets recognized in the third quarter of 2019 as described below which decreased the amortization rate the intangible assets were fully amortized in november 2020 

impairmentloss on saleexchange of longlived assets  during 2020 we recognized a loss on saleexchange of longlived assets of 1007 million of which 616 million related to the 2020 asset exchange transactions defined and discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and 391 million related to asset sales described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded impairment of longlived assets of 11244 million of which 10357 million was associated with our nonstrategic assets located in the ohio utica and 887 million was associated with our pennsylvania and west virginia utica assets the impairment was due primarily to depressed natural gas prices and changes in our development strategy during the third quarter of 2019 we recorded a loss on exchange of longlived assets of 139 million related to the 2019 asset exchange transaction defined and discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the 2019 impairment test 

impairment of intangible and other assets during the fourth quarter of 2020 we recognized impairment of 347 million of which 228 million related to our assessment that the fair values of certain of our rightofuse lease assets were less than their carrying values and 119 million related to impairments of certain nonoperating receivables as a result of expected credit losses during the third quarter of 2019 we recognized impairment of 154 million of intangible assets associated with noncompete agreements for former rice energy inc executives who are now our employees 

impairment and expiration of leases impairment and expiration of leases for 2020 was 3067 million compared to 5564 million for 2019 the decrease was driven by increased lease expirations in 2019 due to our change in strategic focus to core development opportunities as well as changes in market conditions 

other operating expenses other operating expenses of 285 million in 2020 were related primarily to transactions changes in legal reserves including settlements and reorganization other operating expenses of 1994 million in 2019 were related primarily to reorganization due to reductions in workforce which resulted in the recognition of severance and other termination benefits changes in legal reserves including settlements contract terminations and the proxy contest see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

other income statement items 

  

gain on equitrans share exchange during the first quarter of 2020 we recognized a gain on the equitrans share exchange as described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

loss on investment in equitrans midstream corporation our investment in equitrans midstream is recorded at fair value by multiplying the closing stock price of equitrans midstreams common stock by the number of shares of equitrans midstreams common stock that we own changes in fair value are recorded in loss on investment in equitrans midstream corporation in the statements of consolidated operations our investment in equitrans midstream fluctuates with changes in equitrans midstreams stock price which was 804 and 1336 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively note the effect of the sale of 50 of our shares of equitrans midstreams common stock was recorded as a reduction to the investment in equitrans midstream in conjunction with our recognition of the gain on the equitrans share exchange see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

dividend and other income the decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 is due primarily to lower dividends received from our investment in equitrans midstream driven by the decrease in the number of shares of equitrans midstreams common stock that we own 

loss on debt extinguishment during 2020 we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of all or a portion of our 4875 senior notes 250 senior notes 300 senior notes floating rate notes and term loan facility defined and discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

interest expense interest expense increased for 2020 compared to 2019 due to increased interest incurred on new debt issued in 2020 as well as interest incurred on letters of credit issued in 2020 these increases were partly offset by lower interest incurred due to the repayment of all or a portion of our 8125 senior notes 4875 senior notes floating rate notes and 250 senior notes and decreased borrowings on our credit facility see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

the adjusted interest rate under the adjustable rate notes defined and discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements cannot exceed 2 of the original interest rate first set forth on the face of the adjustable rate notes however if our credit ratings improve the interest rate under the adjustable rate notes could be reduced to as low as the original interest rate set forth on the face of the adjustable rate notes 

income tax benefit see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of oil and gas properties 

see critical accounting policies and estimates and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of our oil and gas properties see also item 1a risk factors – natural gas ngls and oil price declines and changes in our development strategy have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including longlived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

capital resources and liquidity 

  

although we cannot provide any assurance we believe cash flows from operating activities and availability under our credit facility should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements inclusive of but not limited to normal operating needs debt service obligations planned capital expenditures and commitments for at least the next twelve months and based on current expectations for the longterm 

credit facility 

we primarily use borrowings under our credit facility to fund working capital needs timing differences between capital expenditures and other cash uses and cash flows from operating activities margin deposit requirements on our derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements including collateral in support of our midstream service contracts joint venture arrangements or construction contracts see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our credit facility 

known contractual and other obligations planned capital expenditures 

purchase obligations we have commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines some of which extend up to 20 years or longer we have entered into agreements to release some of our capacity under these longterm contracts we also have commitments for processing capacity in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream aggregate future payments for these items as of december 31 2020 were 248 billion composed of 13 billion in 2021 17 billion in 2022 18 billion in 2023 19 billion in 2024 18 billion in 2025 and 163 billion primarily in 2026 through 2042 we also have commitments to purchase equipment materials frac sand for use as a proppant in our hydraulic fracturing operations and minimum volume commitments associated with certain water agreements as of december 31 2020 future commitments under these contracts were 965 million in 2021 and 143 million in 2022 

contractual commitments we have contractual commitments under our debt agreements including interest payments and principal repayments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion including the timing of principal repayments 

unrecognized tax benefits as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements we had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2020 of 1812 million of which 903 million is offset against deferred tax assets for general business tax credit carryforwards and nols we are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities 

table of contents 

planned capital expenditures in 2021 we expect to spend approximately 11 to 12 billion in total capital expenditures excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests because we are the operator of a high percentage of our acreage the amount and timing of these capital expenditures are largely discretionary we could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2021 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas ngls and oil the availability of necessary equipment infrastructure and capital the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals and drilling completion and acquisition costs 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1538 million for 2020 compared to 1852 million for 2019 the decrease was due primarily to lower cash operating revenues and unfavorable timing of working capital payments partly offset by increased cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges income tax refunds plus interest received of 440 million during 2020 and lower cash operating expenses 

our cash flows from operating activities are affected by movements in the market price for commodities we are unable to predict such movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing refer to item 1a risk factors – natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position for further information 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1556 million for 2020 compared to 1601 million for 2019 the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures as a result of our change in strategic focus from production growth to capital efficiency as well as cash received from asset sales and the equitrans share exchange the decrease was partly offset by cash paid for acquisitions as described in note 6  

the following table summarizes our capital expenditures 



  

a capital expenditures attributable to noncontrolling interests were 49 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

b represents the net impact of noncash capital expenditures including capitalized sharebased compensation costs the effect of timing of receivables from working interest partners and accrued capital expenditures the impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the reversal of the prior period accrual as well as the current period estimate 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 32 million for 2020 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 249 million for 2019 for 2020 the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity and the primary use of financing cash flows was net repayments of debt for 2019 the primary uses of financing cash flows were net repayments of debt and credit facility borrowings and the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from borrowings on the term loan facility see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt 

on march 26 2020 we announced the suspension of our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for purposes of accelerating cash flow to be used for our deleveraging plan 

table of contents 

depending on our actual and anticipated sources and uses of liquidity prevailing market conditions and other factors we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases in the open market or privately negotiated transactions the amounts involved in any such transactions may be material additionally we plan to dispose of our remaining retained shares of equitrans midstreams common stock and use the proceeds to reduce our debt

accounting for gas ngl and oil producing activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 

  

the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable to determine whether impairment of our oil and gas properties has occurred we compare the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying values of those properties estimated future cash flows are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves and assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by us for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the intended use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted for basis differentials future operating costs and inflation proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future undiscounted cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their fair value estimates 

capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated for recoverability on a prospective basis at least annually indicators of potential impairment include changes due to economic factors potential shifts in business strategy and historical experience the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced if we do not intend to drill on the property prior to expiration of the lease or do not have the intent and ability to extend renew trade or sell the lease prior to expiration impairment expense is recorded 

we believe accounting for gas ngl and oil producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls and future production costs as well as the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and timing of recoveries significant changes in these estimates could result in the costs of our proved and unproved properties not being recoverable therefore we would be required to recognize impairment see impairment of oil and gas properties and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

our estimates of proved reserves are reassessed annually using geological reservoir and production performance data reserve estimates are prepared by our engineers and audited by independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices operating costs economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in certain proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and our consolidated financial statements 

  

we estimate future net cash flows from natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a twelvemonth average price which is calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the twelvemonth period and as such is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is based on future statutory tax rates and tax deductions and credits available under current laws 

we believe oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because we must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates production costs and the timing of development expenditures future results of operations and the strength of our consolidated balance sheet for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions significant changes in these estimates could result in a change to our estimated reserves which could lead to a material change to our production depletion expense see impairment of oil and gas properties for additional information on our oil and gas reserves

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

we have recorded deferred tax assets resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an amt credit carryforward other federal tax credit carryforwards unrealized capacity contract losses incentive compensation and investments in securities we have established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related primarily to federal and state nol carryforwards and our investment in equitrans midstream because we believe it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be fully realized we established a valuation allowance against the state and part of the federal deferred tax asset related to our investment in equitrans midstream because the fair value loss is not expected to be fully realized for tax purposes due to capital loss limitations no other significant valuation allowances have been established as we believe that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets changes to our valuation allowance would impact our income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

we estimate the amount of financial statement benefit recorded for uncertain tax positions see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe income taxes are critical accounting estimates because we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit recorded for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance should be established we exercise judgment on whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income to determine the amount of financial statement benefit recorded for uncertain tax positions we consider the amounts and probabilities of outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period we record an expense or benefit in income tax expense in our statements of consolidated operations future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions a change to future taxable income or tax planning strategies could impact our ability to utilize deferred tax assets which would increase or decrease our income tax expense and taxes paid 

derivative instruments we enter into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to reduce exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production 

we estimate the fair value of our financial instruments using quoted market prices when available if quoted market prices are not available the fair value is based on models that use marketbased parameters including forward curves discount rates volatilities and nonperformance risk as inputs nonperformance risk considers the effect of our credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterpartys credit standing on the fair value of assets we estimate nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to our credit rating or the counterpartys credit rating and the yield on a riskfree instrument the values reported in the consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or as market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond our control change 

we believe derivative instruments are critical accounting estimates because our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to the volatility of both nymex natural gas prices and basis future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions refer to item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for discussion of a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability for contingencies based on our assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we consider many factors in making these assessments including historical experience and matter specifics estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results 

table of contents 

we accrue a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the amount and timing of settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of our plugging and abandonment obligations is recorded at the time the obligation is incurred which is typically at the time the well is spud 

  

we believe contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because we must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligation settlement in addition we must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions if we incur losses related to contingencies that are higher than we expect we could incur additional costs to settle such obligations if the expected amount and timing of our asset retirement obligations change we will be required to adjust the carrying value of our liabilities in future periods 

contract asset in the first quarter of 2020 we entered into two share purchase agreements with equitrans midstream to sell to equitrans midstream 50 of our ownership of equitrans midstreams common stock in exchange for a combination of cash and rate relief under certain of our gathering agreements with eqm an affiliate of equitrans midstream the rate relief was effected through the execution the consolidated gga defined and discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we recorded a contract asset representing the estimated fair value of the rate relief provided by the consolidated gga key assumptions used in the fair value calculation included an estimated production volume forecast a marketbased discount rate and a probabilityweighted estimate of the inservice date of the mountain valley pipeline beginning with the mountain valley pipeline inservice date we will recognize amortization of the contract asset over a period of approximately four years in a manner consistent with the expected timing of our realization of the economic benefits of the rate relief provided by the consolidated gga 

we believe the consolidated gga contract asset is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used in the valuation of the contract asset involved significant judgment future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions a change in the estimated production volume forecast the marketbased discount rate or the probabilityweighted estimate of the inservice date of the mountain valley pipeline could have resulted in a change in the valuation of the contract asset 

convertible notes in the second quarter of 2020 we issued the convertible notes defined and discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

at issuance we separated the convertible notes into liability and equity components the carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of similar debt instruments that do not have associated convertible features the carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal value of the convertible notes the equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the condition for equity classification the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount the debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes using the effective interest rate method issuance costs were allocated to the liability and equity components of the convertible notes based on their relative fair values 

in connection with the convertible notes offering we entered into the capped call transactions defined and discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the capped call transactions are separate from the convertible notes the capped call transactions were recorded in shareholders equity and were not accounted for as derivatives the cost to purchase the capped call transactions was recorded as a reduction to equity and will not be remeasured 

upon conversion of the convertible notes we intend to use a combined settlement approach to satisfy our settlement obligation by paying or delivering to holders of the convertible notes cash equal to the principal amount of the obligation and eqt common stock for amounts that exceed the principal amount of the obligation as such we used the treasury stock method for the diluted earnings per share eps calculation and there is no adjustment to the diluted eps numerator for the cashsettled portion of the instrument 

we believe the accounting complexity of the convertible notes is a critical accounting estimate because we used judgment to determine the balance sheet classification to determine the treatment of the capped call transactions and to determine the existence of any derivatives that may require separate accounting under applicable accounting guidance future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 

business combinations accounting for a business combination requires a company to record the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at fair value 

table of contents 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we completed the chevron acquisition the most significant assumptions used in accounting for the chevron acquisition include those used to estimate the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired the acquired investment in midstream gathering assets and acquired contract liabilities we calculated the fair value of the acquired proved oil and gas properties including inprocess wells using a riskadjusted aftertax discounted cash flow analysis that was based on the following key assumptions future commodity prices projections of estimated quantities of reserves estimated future rates of production projected reserve recovery factors timing and amount of future development and operating costs and a weighted average cost of capital we calculated the fair value of the acquired unproved properties using the guideline transaction method that was based on the following key assumptions future development plans from a market participant perspective and value per undeveloped acre we calculated the fair value of our investment in the midstream gathering assets primarily using a discounted cash flow analysis that was based on the following key assumptions projected revenues expenses and capital expenditures we calculated the fair value of acquired contract liabilities using estimated future volumes and annual contract commitments calculated on a discounted basis that was based on the following key assumptions estimated future volumes and market participant cost of debt 

we believe business combinations are critical accounting estimates because the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities involves significant judgment about future events future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk and derivative instruments our primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas and ngls at our ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations prolonged low or significant extended declines in natural gas and ngls prices could adversely affect among other things our development plans which would decrease the pace of development and the level of our proved reserves increases in natural gas and ngls prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels in addition to the extent we have hedged our production at prices below the current market price we will not benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

the overall objective of our hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices our use of derivatives is further described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and commodity risk management under capital resources and liquidity in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our otc derivative commodity instruments are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of those institutions is regularly monitored we primarily enter into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production we also enter into derivative instruments to hedge basis and exposure to fluctuations in interest rates our use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by our hedge and financial risk committee and reviewed by our board of directors 

  

for derivative commodity instruments used to hedge our forecasted sales of production which are at for the most part nymex natural gas prices we set policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels that are exposed to price risk we have an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

the derivative commodity instruments we use are primarily swap collar and option agreements these agreements may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity we use these agreements to hedge our nymex and basis exposure we may also use other contractual agreements when executing our commodity hedging strategy we monitor price and production levels on a continuous basis and make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted 

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas on december 31 2020 and 2019 would increase the fair value of our natural gas derivative commodity instruments by approximately 501 million and 389 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas on december 31 2020 and 2019 would decrease the fair value of our natural gas derivative commodity instruments by approximately 495 million and 395 million respectively for purposes of this analysis we applied the 10 change in the market price of natural gas on december 31 2020 and 2019 to our natural gas derivative commodity instruments as of december 31 2020 and 2019 to calculate the hypothetical change in fair value the change in fair value was determined using a method similar to our normal process for determining derivative commodity instrument fair value described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

the above analysis of our derivative commodity instruments does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on our physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge our forecasted produced gas approximates a portion of our expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge our forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on our physical sales of natural gas assuming that the derivative commodity instruments are not closed in advance of their expected term and the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

interest rate risk changes in market interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates we pay on borrowings on our credit facility and prior to its full redemption on june 30 2020 our term loan facility none of the interest we pay on our senior notes fluctuates based on changes to market interest rates a 1 increase in interest rates on our borrowings on our credit facility and term loan facility during the year ended december 31 2020 would have increased 2020 annual interest expense by approximately 5 million a 1 increase in interest rates on our borrowings under our credit facility term loan facility and floating rate notes during the year ended december 31 2019 would have increased 2019 annual interest expense by approximately 14 million 

interest rates on the adjustable rate notes fluctuate based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes by moodys sp and fitch for a discussion of credit rating downgrade risk see item 1a risk factors – our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of our debt 

other market risks we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change our otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as the financial industry as a whole we use various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate our credit risk exposures including monitoring current market conditions and counterparty credit fundamentals credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk we enter into transactions primarily with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enter into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

approximately 47 or 456 million of our otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2020 had a positive fair value approximately 75 or 718 million of our otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 had a positive fair value 

  

as of december 31 2020 we were not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to our derivative contracts during the year ended december 31 2020 we made no adjustments to the fair value of our derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in our established fair value procedure we monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of our derivative contracts 

  

we are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas ngls and oil revenues and related accounts receivable from our operations are generated primarily from the sale of produced natural gas ngls and oil to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets that are accessible through our transportation portfolio which includes markets in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states and canada we also contract with certain processors to market a portion of ngls on our behalf 

no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for our credit facility holds more than 10 of the financial commitments under such facility the large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit our exposure to disruption or consolidation in the banking industry

 item 1 business 

  

general 

eqt is a natural gas production company with operations focused in the marcellus and utica shales of the appalachian basin based on average daily sales volumes eqt is the largest producer of natural gas in the united states as of december 31 2019  eqt had 175 tcfe of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves across approximately 13 million gross acres including approximately 11 million gross acres in the marcellus play 

strategy 

the company is dedicated to responsibly developing its worldclass asset base in the core of the appalachian basin the company believes its asset scale and contiguity of its acreage position differentiates it from its appalachian basin peers and that its evolution into a modern digitallyenabled exploration and production business will continue to enhance its strategic advantage 

the companys unique asset base supports a multiyear inventory of combodevelopment projects in its core acreage position which consist of developing multiple wells and pads simultaneously following a change in leadership in july 2019 the company implemented an operational strategy designed to leverage this differentiation to become the lowest cost operator in the appalachian basin primarily by focusing on combodevelopment projects to maximize operational efficiencies the company believes that combodevelopment projects are key to delivering sustainably low well costs and higher returns on invested capital beyond cost benefits combodevelopment projects maximize reservoir recoveries mitigate future curtailments and maximize the capital efficiency of the companys midstream service providers the company expects to drill approximately 13 to 25 wells per combodevelopment project with average lateral lengths from 12000 feet to 14000 feet the companys target pennsylvania marcellus well cost is 730 per foot which the company expects to achieve in the second half of 2020 

in an effort to further the companys operational strategy and improve the companys leverage ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company announced a plan to reduce its absolute debt using free cash flow and targeted proceeds from the monetization of select nonstrategic exploration and production assets core mineral assets and the companys remaining retained equity interest in equitrans midstream the deleveraging plan 

2019 highlights 

 

outlook   

in 2020  the company expects to spend 115 billion to 125 billion in total capital expenditures planned capital expenditures will be funded by cash generated from operations and allocated as follows approximately 09 billion to reserve development approximately 150 million to land and lease acquisitions approximately 85 million to other production infrastructure and approximately 55 million to capitalized overhead reserve development capital expenditures will be spent across the companys three primary operating areas with approximately 70 spent in pennsylvania marcellus approximately 22 spent in ohio utica and approximately 8 spent in west virginia marcellus the companys 2020 capital expenditure program is expected to deliver sales volumes of 1450 bcfe to 1500 bcfe which is in line with 2019 sales volumes using approximately 500 million less capital funding than the 2019 capital expenditure program 

the companys revenues earnings liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for and the companys ability to develop its reserves of natural gas ngls and oil due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil at the companys ultimate sales 

points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations changes in natural gas ngls and oil prices could affect among other things the companys development plans which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the companys reserves as well as the companys revenues earnings or liquidity lower prices and changes in development plans could also result in noncash impairments in the book value of the companys oil and gas properties or other longlived intangible assets or downward adjustments to the companys estimated proved reserves any such impairments or downward adjustments to the companys estimated reserves could potentially be material to the company 

see impairment of oil and gas properties and critical accounting policies and estimates included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the companys accounting policies and significant assumptions related to accounting for oil and gas producing activities and the companys accounting policies and processes related to impairment reviews for proved and unproved property and goodwill 

segment and geographical information 

the companys operations consist of one reportable segment the company has a single companywide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments the company measures financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an areabyarea basis substantially all of the companys assets and operations are located in the appalachian basin 

reserves 

  

the following tables summarize the companys proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months and disaggregated by product and play substantially all of the companys reserves reside in continuous accumulations 





the following table summarizes the companys proved developed and undeveloped reserves using average firstdayofthemonth closing prices for the prior twelve months and disaggregated by state 



the companys total proved reserves decreased by 4348 bcfe or 197 in 2019 from 2018 due to a downward revision of previously proved reserves of 4907 bcfe as a result of changes in the companys development strategy and the production of 1508 bcfe partly offset by extensions discoveries and other additions of 2068 bcfe 

following a change in leadership in july 2019 the company implemented a combodevelopment strategy that refocused operations in the companys core assets and is driving the execution of new development sequencing processes that emphasize efficiency and productivity while these efforts are expected to result in an approximate 25 decrease in well costs they negatively impact proved undeveloped reserves as a result of i derecognizing previouslyrecorded proved undeveloped reserves that are now not included in the companys substantially revised fiveyear capital allocation program for purposes of the companys reserves calculations and ii executing a development sequencing strategy that will result in increased probabletoproved developed conversion 

the following table provides a rollforward of proved undeveloped reserves 



 

as of december 31 2019 the company had one well with proved undeveloped reserves of 91 bcfe that had remained undeveloped for more than five years completion activities for this well are planned for 2020 

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the preparation of and yearoveryear changes in the companys reserves estimate 

based on the companys mix of proved undeveloped and probable reserves the company estimates an undeveloped drilling inventory of approximately 1565 net locations in pennsylvania and west virginia marcellus at the companys current drilling pace these net locations provide more than 15 years of drilling inventory based on net undeveloped marcellus acres average expected lateral length of 12000 feet and well spacing of 1000 feet the company believes that its change in development strategy coupled with its undeveloped inventory located in a premier core asset base will lead to sustainable free cash flow generation and higher returns on invested capital

markets and customers 

natural gas sales natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company typically receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin is typically lower relative to nymex henry hub louisiana the location for pricing nymex natural gas futures as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast united states in recent years to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production at for the most part nymex natural gas prices for information on the companys hedging strategy and its derivative instruments refer to commodity risk management in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

ngls sales the company primarily sells ngls recovered from its natural gas production the company primarily contracts with markwest energy partners lp markwest to process its natural gas and extract from the produced natural gas heavier hydrocarbon streams consisting predominately of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline the company also contracts with markwest to market a portion of the companys ngls in addition the company has contractual arrangements with williams ohio valley midstream llc to process its natural gas and market a portion of its ngls 

  

average sales price the following table presents the companys average sales price per unit of natural gas ngls and oil with and without the effects of cash settled derivatives as applicable 



for additional information on pricing see average realized price reconciliation in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

natural gas marketing eqt energy llc the companys indirect whollyowned marketing subsidiary provides marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management services primarily for the benefit of the company eqt energy llc also engages in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of the company to limit the companys exposure to shifts in market prices 

customers the company sells natural gas and ngls to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets that are accessible through the companys transportation portfolio particularly where there is expected future demand growth such as in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states and canada as of december 31 2019 approximately 60 of company sales volumes reach markets outside of appalachia following the mountain valley pipelines inservice date which is currently expected to be january 1 2021  approximately 80 of company sales volumes are expected to reach markets outside of appalachia 

the company has access to approximately 29 bcf per day of firm contractual pipeline takeaway capacity and 06 bcf per day of firm processing capacity in addition the company is committed to an initial 129 bcf per day of firm capacity on the mountain valley pipeline upon its inservice date these firm transportation and processing agreements may require minimum volume delivery commitments which the company expects to principally fulfill with existing proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves the following table summarizes the companys delivery commitments for the next five years as of december 31 2019  



no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the companys total operating revenues for 2019  2018 and 2017  

seasonality 

generally but not always the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers may also impact demand 

competition 

  

other natural gas producers compete with the company in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and ngls and the securing of services labor equipment and transportation required to conduct operations the companys competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers operators and marketing companies 

regulation 

  

regulation of the companys operations the companys exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the following the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing the companys natural gas resources 

the companys operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the following regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties ohio and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia the company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus and upper devonian acreage in 2013 the pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas various states also impose certain regulatory requirements to transfer wells to third parties or discontinue operations in the event of divestitures by the company 

the company maintains limited gathering operations that are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including the following air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations including regulations by the department of transportations pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

in 2010 congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other cftc rules that may be relevant to the company have yet to be finalized because significant cftc rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented it is not possible at this time to predict the full extent of the impact of the regulations on the companys hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company has experienced increased and anticipates additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

regulators periodically review or audit the companys compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the company 

the following is a summary of some of the existing laws rules and regulations to which the companys business operations are subject 

natural gas sales and transportation the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by the ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation the fercs regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas the company produces and the manner in which the company markets its production the ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales which include all of the companys sales of its own production under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties of over 1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation while the companys production activities have not been regulated by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga the company is required to report aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions use contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices in addition congress may enact legislation or the ferc may adopt regulations that may subject certain of the companys otherwise nonferc jurisdictional facilities to further regulation failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject the company to civil penalty liability 

the cftc also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas with regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities and any related hedging activities that the company undertakes the company is thus required to observe antimarket manipulation and disruptive trading practices laws and related regulations enforced by the ferc andor the cftc the cftc also holds substantial enforcement authority including the ability to assess civil penalties 

the ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which the company may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that the company produces as well as the revenues the company receives for sales of natural gas and release of its natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 the ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company the fercs initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore the company cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can the company determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on the companys natural gasrelated activities 

under the fercs current regulatory regime transmission services must be provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or negotiated rates both of which are subject to ferc approval the ferc also allows jurisdictional gas pipeline companies to charge marketbased rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive gathering service which occurs upstream of fercjurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters section 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga although the ferc has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a nonjurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function the fercs determinations as to the classification of facilities are done on a casebycase basis to the extent that the ferc issues an order that reclassifies certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities and depending on the scope of that decision the companys costs of transporting gas to point of sale locations may increase the company believes that the thirdparty natural gas pipelines on which its gas is gathered meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company however the distinction between the fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services could be subject to potential litigation so the classification and regulation of those gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatorytake requirements although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 

oil and ngls price controls and transportation rates sales prices of oil and ngls are not currently regulated and are made at market prices the companys sales of these commodities are however subject to laws and to regulations issued by the federal trade commission ftc prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market the ftc holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations including the ability to assess civil penalties of over 1 million per day per violation the companys sales of these commodities and any related hedging activities are also subject to cftc oversight as discussed above 

the price the company receives from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market some of the companys transportation of oil and ngls is through fercregulated interstate common carrier pipelines effective as of january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations the fercs regulation of crude oil and ngls transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipelines although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry the company is not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or ferc proceedings if any on the transportation costs associated with crude oil production from the companys crude oil producing operations 

environmental health and safety regulation the business operations of the company are also subject to numerous stringent federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing operating and plugging and abandoning wells and related facilities violations of these laws can result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas or areas with endangered or threatened species restrictions require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production 

moreover the trend has been for stricter regulation of activities that have the potential to affect the environment additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by congress federal agencies the states local governments and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective therefore the company is unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance the regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability the company has established procedures however for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to track compliance with regulatory policies and procedures 

the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and workplace safety laws and regulations as amended from time to time to which the companys business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition earnings or cash flows 

hazardous substances and waste handling the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment these persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in addition despite the petroleum exclusion of section 10114 of cercla which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas the company generates materials in the course of its operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances based on their characteristics however the company is unaware of any liabilities arising under cercla for which the company may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect the company 

the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws establish detailed requirements for the generation handling storage treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes rcra specifically excludes drilling fluids produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes however these wastes may be regulated by the epa or state agencies under rcras less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions or under state laws or other federal laws moreover it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future recently in april 2019 following litigation and a resulting consent decree related to the epas requirements under rcra to review oil and gas waste regulations the epa determined that revisions to the regulations were not required concluding that any adverse effects related to oil and gas waste were more appropriately and readily addressed within the framework of existing state regulatory programs any changes to state programs could result in an increase in the companys costs to manage and dispose waste which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition 

the company currently owns leases or operates numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for many years although the company believes that it has used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on under or from the properties owned or leased by the company or on under or from other locations including offsite locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal in addition some of the companys properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under the companys control the company is able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which the company acts or has acted as operator the failure of a prior owner or operator to comply with applicable environmental regulations may in certain circumstances be attributed to the company as current owner or operator under cercla these properties and the substances disposed or released on under or from them may be subject to cercla rcra and analogous state laws under such laws the company could be required to undertake response or corrective measures regardless of fault which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or waste pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 

water discharges the federal water pollution control act or the clean water act cwa and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes into federal and state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or a state equivalent agency the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters including wetlands is also prohibited unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers corps in june 2015 the epa and the corps issued a final rule defining the scope of the epas and the corps jurisdiction over waters of the united states wotus but several legal challenges to the rule followed and the wotus rule was stayed nationwide in october 2015 pending resolution of the legal challenges the epa and the corps proposed a rule in july 2017 to repeal the wotus rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the cwas jurisdiction in january 2018 the us supreme court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the wotus rule resides with the federal district courts which lifted the stay and resulted in a patchwork application of the rule in some states but not in others in october 2019 the epa issued a final rule repealing the wotus rule and the repeal rule became effective in december 2019 the repeal rule has already been challenged in federal district courts in new mexico new york and south carolina in january 2020 the epa and the corps announced the final rule redefining the definition of wotus the new definition narrows the scope of waters that are covered as jurisdictional under the cwa several groups have already announced their intention to challenge the new rule as a result future implementation is uncertain at this time to the extent a stay of this rule or the implementation of a revised rule expands the scope of the cwas jurisdiction the company could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas which could delay the development of the companys natural gas and oil projects also pursuant to these laws and regulations the company may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or stormwater and to develop and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc plans in connection with onsite storage of significant quantities of oil these laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal remediation and damages 

air emissions the federal clean air act caa and comparable state laws regulate the emission of air pollutants from many sources such as for example tank batteries and compressor stations through air emissions standards construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain pre‑approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants the costs of which could be significant the need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of the companys oil and natural gas projects over the next several years the company may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissionsrelated issues for example although 

all counties in which the company operates are currently in attainment with the 2015 national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone these determinations may be revised in the future reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new facilities or modify existing facilities in any newly designated nonattainment areas compliance with more stringent standards and other environmental regulations could delay or prohibit the companys ability to obtain permits for its operations or require the company to install additional pollution control equipment the costs of which could be significant 

climate change and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases ghg present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that among other things establish prevention of significant deterioration psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal or criteria pollutant emissions facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions are required to meet best available control technology standards established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a case‑by‑case basis these caa requirements could adversely affect the companys operations and restrict or delay the companys ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources in addition the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of the companys operations 

in june 2016 the epa finalized new regulations that established new source performance standards nsps known as subpart ooooa for methane and volatile organic compounds voc from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities in september 2018 the epa proposed amendments to the 2016 subpart ooooa standards that would reduce the 2016 rules fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expand exceptions to pneumatic pump requirements among other changes various industry and environmental groups have separately challenged both the methane requirements and the epas attempts to delay the implementation of the rule in addition in april 2018 several states filed a lawsuit seeking to compel the epa to issue methane performance standards for existing sources in the oil and natural gas source category in november 2019 the epa issued a proposed rulemaking to revise subpart ooooa to rescind the methanespecific requirements for certain oil and natural gas sources in the production and processing segments as a result of the actions described above the company cannot predict with certainty the scope of any final methane regulations or the costs for complying with federal methane regulations 

at the state level several states have proceeded with regulation targeting ghg emissions for example in june 2018 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep released revised versions of gp5 and gp5a pennsylvanias general air permits applicable to processing plants and well site operations among other facilities these permits apply to new or modified sources constructed on or after august 8 2018 with emissions below certain specified thresholds gp5 and gp5a impose best available technology bat standards which are in addition to and in many cases more stringent than the federal nsps these bat standards include a 200 ton per year limit on methane emissions above which a bat requirement for methane emissions control applies moreover in december 2019 the pennsylvania environmental quality board eqb approved a proposed rulemaking for the control of emissions of vocs and other pollutants for existing sources upon publication in the pennsylvania bulletin the padep will accept public comments on the proposed rulemaking a final rulemaking could be submitted to and approved by the eqb in late 2020 state regulations such as these could impose increased compliance costs on the companys operations 

while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of capandtrade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting ghgs in october 2019 pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed an executive order directing the padep to draft regulations establishing a capandtrade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions with the intent of enabling pennsylvania to join the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi a multistate regional capandtrade program comprised of several eastern us states subsequently legislators in the pennsylvania general assembly introduced a bill that if approved would require legislative approval by both chambers of the pennsylvania general assembly in order for pennsylvania to join the rggi the eqb also accepted an economywide capandtrade petition for study in april 2019 the padep is evaluating the petition and will provide a recommendation to the eqb that could result in a statewide capandtrade program across all sectors of the economy if pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of the rggi or otherwise implements a capandtrade program it could result in increased operating costs if the company is required to purchase emission allowances in connection with its operations 

on an international level the united states is one of almost 200 nations that in december 2015 agreed to an international climate change agreement in paris france that calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and be transparent about the 

measures each country will use to achieve its ghg emissions targets paris agreement the paris agreement was signed by the united states in april 2016 and entered into force on november 4 2016 however the paris agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants in august 2017 the us department of state officially informed the united nations of the united states intent to withdraw from the paris agreement the paris agreement provides for a fouryear exit process beginning when it took effect in november 2016 which would result in an effective exit date of november 2020 the united states adherence to the exit process andor the terms on which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact the companys business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from the companys equipment and operations could require the company to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with the companys operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas the company produces and lower the value of its reserves 

notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change the international energy agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades however recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energyrelated assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while the company cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to the companys assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on the companys exploration and production operations 

hydraulic fracturing activities vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the companys industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the companys well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near the companys drilling locations the company conducts baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of the companys drilling pads 

hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act sdwa over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and issued permitting guidance in february 2014 regarding such activities the epa also finalized rules in june 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants 

certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices for example in december 2016 the epa released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources the final report concluded that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local or regionalscale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids chemicals or produced water injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits because the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources this yearslong study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level 

in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities for example in january 2016 the padep issued new rules establishing stricter 

disposal requirements for wastes associated with hydraulic fracturing activities which include among other things a requirement to obtain new permits or closure of centralized impoundments used for the storage of drill cuttings and waste fluids further these rules include requirements relating to storage tank security secondary containment for storage vessels construction rules for gathering lines and horizontal drilling under streams and temporary transport lines for freshwater and wastewater additionally in january 2020 the eqb approved a well permit fee increase from 5000 to 12500 for all unconventional wells local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the company operates the company could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells 

occupational safety and health act the company is also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha as amended and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees in addition oshas hazard communication standard the emergency planning and community right to know act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in the companys operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens 

endangered species act the federal endangered species act esa provides for the protection of endangered and threatened species pursuant to the esa if a species is listed as threatened or endangered restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species habitat similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the migratory bird treaty act the us fish and wildlife service fws may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species a critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit access to protected areas for natural gas and oil development further the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause the company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on the companys exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on the companys ability to develop and produce reserves

 item 1a   risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position 

our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position depend upon the prices for natural gas ngls and oil the prices for natural gas ngls and oil have historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include 

 

the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 412 per mmbtu to a low of 182 per mmbtu from january 1 2019 through december 31 2019  and the daily spot prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 6624 per barrel to a low of 4631 per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast united states in recent years because our production and reserves predominantly consist of natural gas approximately 95 of equivalent proved developed reserves changes in natural gas prices have significantly greater impact on our financial results than oil prices ngls are made up of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics which adds further volatility to the pricing of ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil at the companys ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations 

prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas ngls and oil prices may adversely affect our revenues operating income cash flows and financial position particularly if we are unable to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngls and oil prices declines in prices could also adversely affect our drilling activities and the amount of natural gas ngls and oil that we can produce economically which may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur noncash impairment charges to earnings reductions in cash flows from lower commodity prices may require us to incur additional borrowings or to reduce our capital spending which could reduce our production and our reserves negatively affecting our future rate of growth lower prices for natural gas ngls and oil may also adversely affect our credit ratings and result in a reduction in our borrowing capacity and access to other capital see impairment of oil and gas properties in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results 

of operations and  natural gas ngls and oil price declines and changes in our development strategy have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including longlived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods  we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in our derivative contracts having a positive fair value in our favor further adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our hedge counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection 

increases in natural gas ngls and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral provided to our hedge counterparties which is interestbearing is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

drilling for and producing natural gas and oil are highrisk and costly activities with many uncertainties our future financial position cash flows and results of operations will depend on the success of our development and acquisition activities which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable natural gas or oil production or that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 

many factors may curtail delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects including the following 

 

any of these risks can cause a delay in our development program or result in substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

further our decisions to purchase explore or develop prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses production data and engineering studies the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes see our proved reserves are estimates that are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves in addition our cost of drilling completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences 

our drilling locations are scheduled out over many years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling in addition we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill our drilling locations 

our management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain well locations as an estimation of our future multiyear drilling activities on our existing acreage these well locations represent a significant part of our business strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including natural gas ngls and oil prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs the availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations topography gathering system and pipeline transportation costs and constraints access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems coordination with coal mining regulatory approvals and other factors because of these uncertain factors we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas ngls or oil from these or any other drilling locations in addition unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained the leases for such acreage will expire further certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling or unitization with adjacent leaseholds controlled by third parties if these third parties are unwilling to pool or unitize such leaseholds with ours the total locations we can drill may be limited as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified 

in addition we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful may not increase our overall production levels and proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations for more information on our drilling locations see item 1 business 

the amount and timing of actual future natural gas ngls and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

because the rate of production from natural gas and oil wells and associated ngls generally declines as reserves are depleted our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngls and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that perform below expectations or do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit low natural gas ngls and oil prices may further limit the types of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced future natural gas ngls and oil production therefore is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable we cannot be certain that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with efficient operation of existing wells our reserves and production together with associated revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs some of which are beyond our control these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows to the extent we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved although we believe our estimates are reasonable actual production revenues and costs to develop reserves will likely vary from estimates and these variances could be material numerous changes over time to the 

assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves 

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelvemonth unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil the amount timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves and thus their actual present value in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our operations or the natural gas ngls and oil industry in general 

we are under the leadership of a substantially reconstituted board of directors and a new executive management team who have implemented a variety of operational organizational cultural and other changes to our business and reserves development strategy and we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the transformation plan or reserves development strategy 

our board of directors was substantially reconstituted at our annual meeting of shareholders on july 10 2019 and following that meeting toby z rice was appointed as president and chief executive officer thereafter our new executive management team implemented a detailed transformation plan designed to effect operational organizational cultural and other changes to our business in order to lower operating costs and increase free cash flow generation through improved efficiency well performance and the use of technology with a primary focus on repositioning the company to effectively execute on largescale combodevelopment projects which consist of developing multiple wells and pads simultaneously we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits from this transformation plan additionally we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully execute combodevelopment projects at the pace and scale that we project which may delay or reduce our production and our reserves negatively affecting our associated revenues 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial position and reduce our future prospects 

our future prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including well development reserve acquisitions corporate items leasehold maintenance and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify and execute optimal business strategies including the appropriate corporate structure and appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial position and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

we may not be able to successfully execute our plan to deleverage our business or otherwise reduce our debt level 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced the deleveraging plan there can be no assurance that we will be able to find attractive asset monetization opportunities or that any such transactions will be completed on our anticipated timeframe if at all furthermore our estimated value for the assets to be monetized under the deleveraging plan involves multiple assumptions and judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain accordingly there can be no assurance that the resulting net cash proceeds from asset monetization transactions will be as anticipated even if such transactions are consummated some of the factors that could affect our ability to successfully execute the deleveraging plan include changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers and the availability of financing to potential purchasers on reasonable terms the number of prospective purchasers the number of competing assets on the market unfavorable economic conditions industry trends and changes in laws and regulations if we are not able to successfully execute the deleveraging plan or otherwise reduce absolute debt to a level we believe 

appropriate our credit ratings may be lowered we may reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or investments and we may revise or delay our strategic plans 

our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  

our business is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the development and acquisition of natural gas ngls and oil reserves we typically fund our capital expenditures with existing cash and cash generated by operations and to the extent our capital expenditures exceed our cash resources from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other external sources of capital if we do not have sufficient borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility we may seek alternate debt or equity financing sell assets or reduce our capital expenditures the issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of among other things natural gas prices actual drilling results the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory technological and competitive developments 

our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

 

if our cash flows from operations or the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to fund our capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain the capital necessary for our planned capital budget or our operations we could be required to curtail our operations and the development of our properties which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

as of december 31 2019  our senior notes were rated baa3 with a negative outlook by moodys investors services moodys bbb– with a negative outlook by standard  poors ratings service sp and bbb– with a negative outlook by fitch ratings service fitch in january 2020 moodys downgraded our senior notes rating to ba1 with a negative outlook in february 2020 sp downgraded our senior notes rating to bb with a negative outlook and fitch downgraded our senior notes rating to bb with a negative outlook see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the downgrades on our financial statements subsequent to december 31 2019  although we are not aware of any current plans of moodys sp or fitch to further downgrade its rating of our senior notes we cannot be assured that one or more will not further downgrade or withdraw entirely their rating of our senior notes low prices for natural gas ngls and oil an increase in the level of our indebtedness or a failure to significantly execute our deleveraging plan may result in moodys sp or fitch further downgrading its rating of our senior notes if there are further downgrades to our credit rating our access to the capital markets may be impacted the cost of shortterm debt through interest rates and fees under our lines of credit may increase the interest rate on our term loan facility and adjustable rate notes each defined in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements will increase the rates available on new longterm debt may increase our pool of investors and funding sources may decrease the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on our derivative instruments may increase and we may be required to provide additional credit assurances including collateral in support of our midstream service contracts joint venture arrangements or construction contracts which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately  5293 million of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 



 

our debt agreements also require compliance with certain covenants if the price that we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance for more information about our debt agreements read capital resources and liquidity in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks 

our business and operating results can be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or other increases in the cost of capital resulting from a reduction in our credit rating or otherwise these changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce cash flow used for operating and capital expenditures and place us at a competitive disadvantage 

disruptions or volatility in the financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve favorable operating results in addition we are exposed to credit risk related to our revolving credit facility to the extent that one or more of our lenders may be unable to provide necessary funding to us under our existing revolving line of credit if it experiences liquidity problems 

uncertainty related to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations 

loans to us under our credit facility may be base rate loans or libor loans libor is calculated by reference to a market for interbank lending and its based on increasingly fewer actual transactions this increases the subjectivity of the libor calculation process and increases the risk of manipulation actions by the regulators or law enforcement agencies as well as ice benchmark administration the current administrator of libor may result in changes to the manner that libor is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates for example on july 27 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 us dollar libor will likely be replaced by the secured overnight financing rate sofr published by the federal reserve bank of new york however the timing of this shift is currently unknown sofr is an overnight rate instead of a term rate making sofr an inexact replacement for libor and there is not an established process to create robust forwardlooking sofr term rates changing the benchmark rate for libor loans from libor to sofr requires calculations of a spread industry organizations are attempting to structure the spread calculation in a manner that minimizes the possibility of value transfer between counterparties borrowers and lenders by the transition but there is no assurance that the calculated spread will be fair and accurate at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be implemented if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate our credit facility to determine the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established as such the potential effect of any such event on our interest expense cannot yet be determined 

derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 

to manage our exposure to price risk we currently and may in the future enter into derivative arrangements utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a portion of our future production such hedges are designed to lock in prices in order to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow these transactions limit our potential gains if natural gas ngls and oil prices rise above the price established by the hedge in addition derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which 

 

we cannot be certain that any derivative transaction we may enter into will adequately protect us from declines in the prices of natural gas ngls or oil furthermore where we choose not to engage in derivative transactions in the future we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas ngls or oil prices than our competitors who engage in derivative transactions lower natural gas ngls and oil prices may also negatively impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts at favorable prices 

derivative transactions also expose us to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract or enters bankruptcy or encounters some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint in this case we may not be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase which increases our exposure if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance we could incur a significant loss 

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells and facilities 

our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to drilling for producing transporting and storing natural gas ngls and oil such as fires explosions slips landslides blowouts and well cratering pipe and other equipment and system failures delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities adverse weather conditions such as freeze offs of wells and pipelines due to cold weather issues related to compliance with environmental regulations environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks oil spills pipeline and tank ruptures encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized releases of brine well stimulation and completion fluids toxic gases or other pollutants into the environment especially those that reach surface water or groundwater inadvertent thirdparty damage to our assets and natural disasters we also face various risks or threats to the operation and security of our or third parties facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants compressor stations and pipelines any of these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property equipment and natural resources pollution or other environmental damage loss of hydrocarbons disruptions to our operations regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of our operations repair and remediation costs and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable and we may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

cyber incidents targeting our systems or natural gas and oil industry systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations 

our business and the natural gas and oil industry in general have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies we depend on this technology to record and store data estimate quantities of natural gas ngls and oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers control nearly all of the natural gas ngls and oil distribution systems in the us which are necessary to transport our products to market 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our systems or infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas ngls and oil difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve and cyber attackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents the cost to remedy an unintended dissemination of sensitive information or data may be significant furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

failure to timely develop our leased real property could result in increased capital expenditures andor impairment of our leases 

mineral rights are typically owned by individuals who may enter into property leases with us to allow for the development of natural gas such leases expire after an initial term typically five years unless certain actions are taken to preserve the lease if we cannot preserve a lease the lease terminates approximately 24 of our net undeveloped acres are subject to leases that could expire over the next three years lack of access to capital changes in government regulations changes in future development plans reduced drilling activity or the reduction in the fair value of undeveloped properties in the areas in which we operate could impact our ability to preserve trade or sell our leases prior to their expiration resulting in the termination and impairment of leases for properties that we have not developed 

capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  we recorded lease impairments and expirations of 5564 million  2797 million and 76 million  respectively refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

our inability to cure any title defects in our leases in a timely and costefficient manner may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

substantially all of our producing properties are concentrated in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area 

substantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the appalachian basin as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by and costs associated with governmental regulation state and local political activities processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations availability of equipment and personnel water shortages or other weatherrelated conditions interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas ngls or oil and changes in state and local laws judicial precedents political regimes and regulations such conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in addition a number of areas within the appalachian basin have historically been subject to mining operations for example third parties may engage in subsurface coal and other mining operations near or under our properties which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties adversely impact our drilling operations or adversely impact thirdparty midstream activities on which we rely in such event our operations may be impaired or interrupted and we may not be able to recover the costs incurred as a result of temporary shutins or the plugging and abandonment of any of our wells furthermore the existence of mining operations near our properties could require coordination to avoid adverse impacts as a result of drilling and mining in close proximity these restrictions on our operations and any similar restrictions could cause delays or interruptions or prevent us from executing our business strategy which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

further insufficient takeaway capacity in the appalachian basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized natural gas prices the appalachian basin has recently experienced periods in which production has surpassed local takeaway capacity resulting in substantial discounts in the price received by producers such as us and others at times being possibly shut in although additional appalachian basin takeaway capacity has been added in recent years the existing and expected capacity may not be sufficient to keep pace with the increased production caused by accelerated drilling in the area in the short term 

due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties 

natural gas ngls and oil price declines and changes in our development strategy have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including longlived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties and goodwill for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in addition we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations because the results are based on estimated future events and estimated future cash flows the estimated future cash flows used to test our proved oil and gas properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by our management for internal planning and budgeting purposes key assumptions used in our analyses include among other things the intended use of the asset the anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil future operating costs inflation and the anticipated proceeds that may be received upon divestiture if there is a possibility that the asset will be divested prior to the end of its useful life commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality locational basis adjustments and inflation proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value additionally when testing goodwill for impairment we also consider the market value of our common stock and other valuation techniques when determining the fair value of our single reporting unit 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 there were indicators that the carrying values of certain of our properties may be impaired due to depressed natural gas prices and changes in our development strategy including our contemplation of a potential asset monetization of certain of our nonstrategic exploration and production assets as a result of our 2019 impairment evaluation we recorded total impairment of 11244 million  of which 10357 million was associated with our nonstrategic assets located in the ohio utica and 887 million was associated with our pennsylvania and west virginia utica assets it is possible that we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods as a result of the above indicators or otherwise in particular future declines in natural gas ngls or oil prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance among other things may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves andor could result in additional noncash impairment charges to writedown the carrying amount of our assets including other longlived intangible assets which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods any impairment of our assets including other longlived intangible assets would require us to take an immediate charge to earnings such charges could be material to our results of operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position see impairment of oil and gas properties in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs completion services equipment supplies personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis 

the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations geologists geophysicists engineers and other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices causing periodic shortages or higher costs historically there have been shortages of personnel and equipment as demand for personnel and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

our ability to drill for and produce natural gas and oil is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for drilling and completion operations and access to water and waste disposal or recycling services at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of produced water and other waste may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to drill and complete natural gas and oil wells requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water our ability to access sources of water and the availability of disposal alternatives to receive all of the water produced from our wells and used in hydraulic fracturing may affect our drilling and completion operations our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations or to timely obtain water sourcing permits or other rights could adversely affect our operations additionally the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of waste which would adversely affect our business and results of operations which could result in decreased cash flows 

in addition federal and state regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for natural gas and oil waste disposal and increased seismic activity in certain areas in some cases operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity in the states where we operate could lead to restrictions on our disposal well injection volumes and increased scrutiny of and delay in obtaining new disposal well permits which could result in increased operating costs which could be material or a curtailment of our operations 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to identify attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with identifying attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot identify attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete in our industry could be harmed 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties many of our competitors have financial resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on existing and changing processes and may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we depend on thirdparty midstream providers for a significant portion of our midstream services and our failure to obtain and maintain access to the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas ngls and oil to market on competitive terms may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

our delivery of natural gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities primarily owned by third parties and our ability to contract with these third parties at competitive rates or at all the capacity of transmission gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties competition for access to pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense and our ability to secure access to pipeline infrastructure on favorable economic terms could affect our competitive position 

we are dependent on thirdparty providers to provide us with access to midstream infrastructure to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market to the extent these services are delayed or unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production access to midstream assets may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may occur more slowly a lack of access to needed infrastructure or an extended interruption of access to or service from thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including vandalism sabotage or cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil 

finally in order to ensure access to certain midstream facilities we have entered into agreements that obligate us to pay demand charges to various pipeline operators we also have commitments with third parties for processing capacity we may be obligated to make payments under these agreements even if we do not fully use the capacity we have reserved and these payments may be significant 

the substantial majority of our midstream and water services are provided by one provider eqm midstream partners lp eqm an affiliate of equitrans midstream therefore any regulatory infrastructure or other events that materially adversely affect eqms business operations will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other thirdparty service providers additionally our midstream services contracts with eqm involve significant longterm financial and other commitments on our part which hinders our ability to diversify our slate of midstream service providers and seek better economic and other terms for the midstream services that are provided to us we have no control over equitrans midstreams or eqms business decisions and operations and neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors us 

historically we have received the substantial majority of our natural gas gathering transmission and storage and water services from eqm additionally on february 26 2020 we executed a new gas gathering agreement with eqm the new eqm gathering agreement which among other things consolidated the majority of our prior gathering agreements with eqm into a single agreement established a new fee structure for gathering and compression fees charged by eqm increased our minimum volume commitments with eqm committed certain of our remaining undedicated acreage to eqm and extended our and eqms contractual obligations with each other to 2035 because we have significant longterm contractual commitments with eqm we expect to receive the majority of our midstream and water services from eqm for the foreseeable future therefore any event whether in our areas of operations or otherwise that adversely affects eqms operations water assets pipelines other transportation facilities gathering and processing facilities financial condition leverage results of operations or cash flows will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other thirdparty service providers accordingly we are subject to the business risks of eqm including the following 

  

 

in addition many of our midstream services contracts with eqm are firm commitments under which we have reserved an agreed upon amount of pipeline or storage capacity with eqm regardless of the capacity that we actually use during each month and we are generally obligated to pay a fixed monthly charge at an amount agreed upon in the contract because these contracts involve significant longterm financial and other commitments on our part that lock us into prices at the time the contract is entered into they could reduce our cash flow during periods of low prices for natural gas ngls and oil when we may have lower volumes of natural gas and ngls and therefore less of a need for capacity and storage or the market prices for such pipeline and storage capacity services may be lower than what we are contractually obligated to pay to eqm further although the new eqm gathering agreement provides for a reduced fee structure for the gathering and compression fees charged by eqm this new fee structure does not take effect until the mountain valley pipelines inservice date which is currently expected to be january 1 2021  however there can be no assurance that the mountain valley pipelines inservice date will not be delayed beyond such date which would consequently delay the effective date of the fee reductions contemplated in the new eqm gathering agreement neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to renegotiate their contracts with us in the event of a prolonged depressed commodity price environment or if the mountain valley pipelines inservice date is delayed our failure to obtain these services on competitive terms could materially harm our business 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines oil spills and concerns raised by advocacy groups or the media about hydraulic fracturing greenhouse gas or methane emissions or fossil fuels in general or about royalty payment and surface use issues may lead to increased litigation and regulatory legislative and judicial scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal laws 

regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations in safety environmental royalty and surface use areas these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed challenged or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

we are subject to complex federal state local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities 

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells and related infrastructure our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of water and other fluids and materials including solid and hazardous wastes incidental to natural gas and oil operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of properties some states allow the statutory pooling and unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration as well as joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and natural gas and oil laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air ground and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed and work practices related to employee health and safety 

to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits approvals and certificates from various federal state and local governmental authorities maintaining compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas ngls and oil resources these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages in addition our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations such costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages as well as corrective action costs 

in december 2017 changes to certain federal income tax laws were signed into law that impact us including but not limited to changes to the regular income tax rate the elimination of the alternative minimum tax full expensing of capital equipment limited deductibility of interest expense and increased limitations on deductible executive compensation the current administration continues to debate further changes to federal income tax laws that could be enacted which could have a material impact on us the most significant potential tax law changes include further changes to the regular income tax rate the expensing of intangible drilling costs or percentage depletion and further limited deductibility of interest expense any of which could adversely impact our current and deferred federal and state income tax liabilities state and local taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate or own assets may enact new taxes such as the imposition of a severance tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce natural gas ngls and oil or change the rates of existing taxes which could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank act which established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including us such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other rules that may be relevant to us or our counterparties have yet to be finalized because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented 

it is not possible at this time to predict the full extent of the impact of the regulations on our hedging program including available counterparties or regulatory compliance obligations we have experienced increased and anticipate additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

federal state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of natural gas and oil wells which could adversely affect our production 

we use hydraulic fracturing in the completion of our natural gas and oil wells hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state natural gas and oil commissions but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority for example the epa finalized rules in june 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants 

certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells see businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation for more information 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these delays costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and workplace safety including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time resulting in longer waiting periods to receive permits and other regulatory approvals failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations 

strict joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental and occupational health and workplace safety impacts of our operations we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such matters 

in addition new or additional laws and regulations new interpretations of existing requirements or changes in enforcement policies could impose unforeseen liabilities significantly increase compliance costs or result in delays of or denial of rights to conduct our development programs for example in june 2015 the epa and the corps issued a final rule under the cwa defining the scope of the epas and the corps jurisdiction over wotus but several legal challenges to the rule followed and the wotus rule was stayed nationwide in october 2015 pending resolution of the legal challenges the epa and the corps proposed a rule in july 2017 to repeal the wotus rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the cwas jurisdiction in january 2018 the us supreme court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the wotus rule resides with the federal district courts which lifted the stay and resulted in a patchwork application of the rule in some states but not in others in october 2019 the epa issued a final rule repealing the wotus rule and the repeal rule became effective in december 2019 the repeal rule has already been challenged in federal district courts in new mexico new york and south carolina in january 2020 the epa and the corps announced the final rule redefining the definition of wotus the new definition narrows the scope of waters that are covered as jurisdictional several groups have already announced their intention to challenge the rule to the extent a stay of this rule or the implementation of a revised rule expands the scope of the cwas jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas such potential regulations or litigation could increase our operating costs reduce our liquidity delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position further the discharges 

of natural gas ngls oil and other pollutants into the air soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties 

regulations related to the protection of wildlife could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

our operations can be adversely affected by regulations designed to protect various wildlife the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in constraints on our exploration and production activities this limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil the impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas ngls and oil that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 

in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that among other things establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal or criteria pollutant emissions facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that will be established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a case‑by‑case basis these epa rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources in addition the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of our operations at the state level several states including pennsylvania have proceeded with regulation targeting ghg emissions such state regulations could impose increased compliance costs on our operations 

while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of capandtrade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs in october 2019 pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed an executive order directing the padep to draft regulations establishing a capandtrade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions with the intent of enabling pennsylvania to join the rggi a multistate regional capandtrade program comprised of several eastern us states subsequently legislators in the pennsylvania general assembly introduced a bill that if approved would require legislative approval by both chambers of the pennsylvania general assembly in order for pennsylvania to join the rggi if pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of the rggi or otherwise implements a capandtrade program it could result in increased operating costs if we are required to purchase emission allowances in connection with our operations 

on an international level the united states is one of almost 200 nations that in december 2015 agreed to the paris agreement which calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its ghg emissions targets the paris agreement was signed by the united states in april 2016 and entered into force on november 4 2016 however the paris agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants in august 2017 the us department of state officially informed the united nations of the united states intent to withdraw from the paris agreement the paris agreement provides for a fouryear exit process beginning when it took effect in november 2016 which would result in an effective exit date of november 2020 the united states adherence to the exit process andor the terms on which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations 

substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the natural gas ngls and oil we produce and lower the value of our reserves 

further recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energyrelated assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations see businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation for more information 

entering into strategic transactions may expose us to various risks 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory and thirdparty approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from these transactions competition for transaction opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing transactions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little or partial control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

acquisitions may disrupt our current plans or operations and may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities we may not achieve the intended benefits of our acquisition of rice energy inc 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas ngls and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well or lease that we acquire and even when we inspect a well or lease we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

on november 13 2017 we completed the acquisition of rice energy inc rice energy there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate rice energys assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits and synergies of the acquisition of rice energy 

changes in our business following the completion of recent significant transactions including the acquisition of rice energy and the separation and distribution and the reconstitution of our board of directors and executive management team following our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders may result in disruptions to our business and negatively impact our operations and our relationships with our customers and business partners 

over the last three years we have completed multiple significant transactions including the acquisition of rice energy and the separation and distribution defined and discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our board of directors was substantially reconstituted at our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders followed by a change in the members of our executive management team as a result of these events our company and employees have experienced significant changes including the departure of members of senior management new leadership in significant roles and employee reassignments as well as a reduction in our workforce the combination of these factors may materially adversely affect our operations further uncertainty related to our business following these significant changes may lead customers and other parties to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in their existing business relationships with us or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and prospects 

the separation and distribution may subject us to future liabilities 

  

in november 2018 we completed the separation and distribution resulting in the spinoff of equitrans midstream a standalone publicly traded corporation that holds our former midstream business 

  

pursuant to agreements we entered into with equitrans midstream in connection with the separation we and equitrans midstream are each generally responsible for the obligations and liabilities related to our respective businesses pursuant to those agreements we and equitrans midstream each agreed to crossindemnities principally designed to allocate financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business to us and those of equitrans midstreams business to it however third parties including governmental agencies could seek to hold us responsible for obligations and liabilities that equitrans midstream agreed to retain or assume and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from equitrans midstream will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities or that equitrans midstream will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations additionally if a court were to determine that the separation or related transactions were consummated with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in equitrans midstream receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent or that it was rendered insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and equitrans midstream impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us and void some or all of the separationrelated transactions any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

if there is a later determination that the distribution or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor opinion of counsel are incorrect or for any other reason significant liabilities could be incurred by us our shareholders or equitrans midstream 

in connection with the separation and distribution we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code as amended the code and certain other us federal income tax matters relating to the distribution and certain related transactions the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel are based on and rely on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us and equitrans midstream including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and equitrans midstream if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if we or equitrans midstream breach any representations or covenants contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel 

notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the ruling or for other reasons including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or equitrans midstream after the distribution further described below an opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in such opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions or that a court would not sustain such a 

challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we equitrans midstream and our shareholders could be subject to material us federal and state income tax liabilities in connection with the separation we and equitrans midstream entered into a tax matters agreement which described the sharing of any such liabilities between us and equitrans midstream

nongaap financial measures reconciliation 

the table below reconciles adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure with total operating revenues its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted operating revenues also referred to as total natural gas and liquids sales including cash settled derivatives is presented because it is an important measure used by the companys management to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons of earnings trends adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of net marketing services and other management uses adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus excludes the impact of the oftenvolatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement adjusted operating revenues also excludes net marketing services and other because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to revenues from its natural gas and liquids production net marketing services and other primarily includes the cost of and recoveries on pipeline capacity releases and revenues for gathering services management further believes that adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating periodtoperiod earnings trends 

  

sales volumes and revenues 



 

sales of natural gas ngls and oil decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 due to a lower average realized price partly offset by a 14 increase in sales volumes excluding 2018 sales volumes related to the 2018 divestitures discussed in note 7 to the 

consolidated financial statements sales volumes increased by 42 in 2019  average realized price decreased due to lower nymex and liquids prices and lower btu uplift partly offset by higher cash settled derivatives for 2019 and 2018  the company received 2663 million and paid 2248 million  respectively of net cash settlements including net premiums received on derivatives not designated as hedges which are included in average realized price but may not be included in operating revenues 

for 2019 the company recognized a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges of 6166 million compared to a loss of 1786 million for 2018  the gain for 2019 was related to increases in the fair market value of the companys nymex swaps and options due to decreases in nymex forward prices the loss for 2018 was related primarily to settlements of nymex swaps and options and basis swaps partly offset by decreases in nymex forward prices 

net marketing services and other decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of fewer capacity releases at lower capacity release rates on the tennessee gas pipeline and lower revenues from gathering services following the 2018 divestitures 

productionrelated operating expenses

operating activities 

net cash flows provided by operating activities were 1852 million for 2019 compared to 2976 million for 2018  the decrease was driven by cash provided by discontinued operations included in 2018 and lower cash operating revenues partly offset by favorable timing of working capital payments and dividends received on the companys investment in equitrans midstream 

the companys cash flows from operating activities will be affected by movements in the market price for commodities the company is unable to predict such movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing refer to item 1a risk factors – natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position  for further information 

investing activities 

net cash flows used in investing activities were 1601 million for 2019 compared to 3979 million for 2018  the decrease was due primarily to lower capital expenditures as a result of the companys change in strategic focus from production growth to capital efficiency and cash used for capital expenditures and capital contributions by discontinued operations included in 2018 partly offset by proceeds received from asset sales in 2018

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the companys commitments and contingencies see item 3 legal proceedings 

recently issued accounting standards 

the companys recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements managements discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were 

reviewed by the audit committee of the companys board of directors the audit committee relate to the companys more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 

  

the carrying values of the companys proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable to determine whether impairment has occurred the company compares estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows from its oil and gas properties to the carrying values of those properties the estimated future cash flows used in the recoverability test are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves and assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by the company for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the intended use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted for basis differentials future operating costs and inflation proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future undiscounted cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their fair value estimates 

capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated for recoverability on a prospective basis at least annually indicators of potential impairment include changes due to economic factors potential shifts in business strategy and historical experience the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced if the company does not intend to drill on the property prior to expiration of the lease or does not have the intent and ability to extend renew trade or sell the lease prior to expiration impairment expense is recorded 

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a critical accounting estimate because the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls future production costs estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of recoveries see impairment of oil and gas properties and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the companys impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the companys estimates of proved reserves are reassessed annually using geological reservoir and production performance data reserve estimates are prepared by the companys engineers and audited by the companys independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices operating costs economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the companys consolidated financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a twelvemonth average price which is calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the twelvemonth period and as such is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using future statutory tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws related to oil and gas producing activities 

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a critical accounting estimate because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates production costs and the timing of development expenditures future results of operations and the strength of the companys consolidated balance sheet for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the companys assumptions see impairment of oil and gas properties for additional information on the companys oil and gas reserves 

  

income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the companys consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an amt credit carryforward other federal tax credit carryforwards unrealized capacity contract losses incentive compensation and investments in securities the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets related to the federal and state nol carryforwards the separate company state impact of the interest expense limitation imposed with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act and the companys investment in equitrans midstream because the company believes it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be completely realized the valuation allowance on the equitrans midstream investment relates to the state and part of the federal deferred tax asset as the fair value loss is not expected to be fully realized for tax purposes due to capital loss limitations in january 2019 the irs announced that it would no longer subject amt refunds to sequestration as such the company reversed the related previously recorded valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2019 no other significant valuation allowances have been established as the company believes that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the companys income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 9 to the companys consolidated financial statements 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are critical accounting estimates because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the companys assumptions 

derivative instruments the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to reduce exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production 

the company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based on models that use marketbased parameters as inputs including forward curves discount rates volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the companys credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterpartys credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the companys or counterpartys credit rating and the yield on a riskfree instrument the values reported in the consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or as market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond the companys control change 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are critical accounting estimates because the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the companys derivative instruments due to the volatility of both nymex natural gas prices and basis future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the companys assumptions 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations the company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based on its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including historical experience and matter specifics estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results 

the company accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the companys plugging and abandonment obligations is recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are spud 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are critical accounting estimates because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the companys assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 2014 and 2019 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock timebased restricted units and stock options beginning in january 2020 awards to directors are typically made in the form of restricted stock units that vest on the date of the companys annual meeting of shareholders following the date of grant 

  

restricted units and performancebased awards that are expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards for liability awards the company estimates on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based on the expected performance through and value of the companys common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the companys consolidated financial statements over the vesting period of the award the company reviews assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes to these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

performancebased awards that are expected to be satisfied in company common stock are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company determines the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the companys consolidated financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based on assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the companys common stock adjusted for any expected changes and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the companys common stock and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the companys consolidated financial statements over the vesting period which historically has been three years for director restricted stock units expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the companys consolidated financial statements in the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based on the closing price of the companys common stock on the date of the grant 

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the companys consolidated financial statements over the vesting period which historically has been three years the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the companys common stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the companys common stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are critical accounting estimates because they may change from periodtoperiod based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the companys common stock future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the companys assumptions see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the companys sharebased compensation plans 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk and derivative instruments 

  

the companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas and ngls at the companys ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations prolonged low or significant extended declines in natural gas and ngls prices could adversely affect among other things the companys development plans which would decrease the pace of development and the level of the companys proved reserves 

the companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the companys use of derivatives is further described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and commodity risk management of capital resources and liquidity in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the companys otc derivative commodity instruments are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of those institutions is regularly monitored the company primarily enters into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the companys use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the companys hedge and financial risk committee and reviewed by the companys board of directors 

  

for derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the companys forecasted sales of production which are at for the most part nymex natural gas prices the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels that are exposed to price risk the company has an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

derivative commodity instruments used by the company are primarily swap collar and option agreements these agreements may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company uses these agreements to hedge its nymex and basis exposure the company may also use other contractual agreements when implementing its commodity hedging strategy the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted 

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from december 31 2019 and 2018 would increase the fair value of these natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 3894 million and 4325 million  respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from december 31 2019 and 2018 would decrease the fair value of these natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 3945 million and 4434 million  respectively for purposes of this analysis the company applied the 10 change in the market price of natural gas from december 31 2019 and 2018 to the companys natural gas derivative commodity instruments to calculate the hypothetical change in fair value the change in fair value was determined using a method similar to the companys normal process for determining derivative commodity instrument fair value described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

the above analysis of the companys derivative commodity instruments does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the companys physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the companys forecasted produced gas approximates a portion of the companys expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the companys forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on the companys physical sales of natural gas assuming that the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term and the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company earns on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates the company pays on borrowings under its credit facility term loan facility and floating rate notes which notes were fully redeemed on february 3 2020 all of the companys senior notes other than the floating rate notes have a fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in market interest rates a 1 increase in interest rates on the companys 

borrowings under its credit facility term loan facility and floating rate notes during the year ended december 31 2019 would have increased 2019 annual interest expense by approximately 14 million 

interest rates on the adjustable rate notes fluctuate based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to the companys senior notes by moodys sp and fitch for a discussion of credit rating downgrade risk see item 1a risk factors – our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys longterm debt and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of the companys longterm debt 

other market risks 

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the companys otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as the financial industry as a whole the company uses various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures including monitoring current market conditions and counterparty credit fundamentals credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions primarily with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

approximately 75  or 7180 million  of the companys otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2019 had a positive fair value approximately 64  or 3695 million  of the companys otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2018 had a positive fair value 

  

as of december 31 2019 the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to its derivative contracts during the year ended december 31 2019 the company made no adjustments to the fair value of its derivative contracts due to creditrelated concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the companys established fair value procedure the company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of its derivative contracts 

  

the company is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas ngls and oil revenues and related accounts receivable from the companys operations are generated primarily from the sale of produced natural gas ngls and oil to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets that are accessible through the companys transportation portfolio which includes markets in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states and canada the company also contracts with certain processors to market a portion of ngls on behalf of the company 

no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for the companys credit facility and the term loan facility holds more than 10 and 15 respectively of the financial commitments under such facilities the large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit the companys exposure to disruption or consolidation in the banking industry

the company’s revenues earnings liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for and the company’s ability to develop its reserves of natural gas oil and ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas and ngls at the companys ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations changes in natural gas ngls and oil prices could affect among other things the companys development plans which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the companys reserves as well as the companys revenues earnings or liquidity lower prices could also result in noncash impairments in the book value of the company’s oil and gas properties or other long lived intangible assets or downward adjustments to the company’s estimated proved reserves any such impairment andor downward adjustment to the company’s estimated reserves could potentially be material to the company see impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill and “critical accounting policies and estimates” included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the company’s accounting policies and significant assumptions related to accounting for oil and gas producing activities and the companys policies and processes with respect to impairment reviews for proved and unproved property and goodwill 

separation and distribution 

on november 12 2018 eqt completed the previously announced separation of its midstream business which was composed of the separately operated natural gas gathering transmission and storage and water services businesses of eqt from its upstream business which is composed of the natural gas oil and natural gas liquids development production and sales and commercial operations of the company the separation the separation was effected by the transfer of the midstream business from eqt to equitrans midstream and the distribution of 801 of the outstanding shares of equitrans midstream common stock to eqts shareholders the distribution eqts shareholders of record as of the close of business on november 1 2018 the record date received 080 shares of equitrans midstream common stock for every one share of eqt common stock held as of the close of business on the record date eqt retained 199 of the outstanding shares of equitrans midstream common stock 

as a result of the distribution equitrans midstream is now an independent public company listed under the ticker symbol “etrn” on the new york stock exchange nyse the company’s common stock is listed under the symbol “eqt” on the nyse 

the company plans to dispose of all of its retained equitrans midstream common stock which may include dispositions through one or more subsequent exchanges for debt or a sale of its shares for cash the company expects to use the proceeds from any dispositions of its retained equitrans midstream common stock to reduce the companys debt 

segment and geographical information 

the companys operations consist of one reportable segment the company has a single companywide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments the company measures financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an areabyarea basis substantially all of the company’s assets and operations are located in the appalachian basin 

proved reserves 

  

the company’s proved reserves increased 2  in 2018  or 11 when adjusted for the impact of the huron divestiture and permian divestiture collectively the 2018 divestitures the companys marcellus assets constituted approximately 191  tcfe of the companys total proved reserves as of december 31 2018  and increased 13  as compared to december 31 2017 the company’s marcellus assets constituted approximately 87  of the companys total proved reserves by volume as of december 31 2018  as of december 31 2018  the company’s proved reserves were as follows 



the company’s natural gas wells generally have long reserve lives assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2019  production guidance the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by 2019  production volumes guidance is approximately 15  years 

the company invested approximately 22550 million  on reserve development during 2018  with total sales volumes of 1488  bcfe an increase of 68  over the previous year the company drilled approximately 153  gross wells  133  net including 105  marcellus gross wells in pennsylvania  99  net 5  upper devonian wells in pennsylvania 12  marcellus wells in west virginia and 31  ohio utica gross wells  17  net during the past three years the company’s capital expenditures for reserve development were 



  

  includes upper devonian formations 

the company sells natural gas and ngls to marketers utilities and industrial customers within its operational footprint and in markets that are accessible through the companys current transportation portfolio the company has access to approximately 29 bcf per day of firm contractual pipeline takeaway capacity and 06 bcf per day of firm processing capacity the company has also committed to an initial 129 bcf per day of firm capacity on the mountain valley pipeline mvp which is expected to be placed inservice in the fourth quarter of 2019 

markets and customers 

no  single customer accounted for more than 10 of eqts total operating revenues for 2018  2017  and 2016  

  

natural gas sales  the company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in the markets that are accessible through the companys current transportation portfolio which includes markets in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states as well as canada natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company typically receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin is lower relative to the price at henry hub louisiana the location for pricing nymex natural gas futures as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the appalachian basin in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production most of which is hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth under the heading “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1  and 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

ngls sales   the company primarily sells ngls processed from its own gas production in its appalachian operations the company primarily contracts with markwest energy partners lp markwest to process natural gas in order to extract the heavier hydrocarbon stream consisting predominately of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline primarily from the company’s produced gas the company also contracts with markwest to market a portion of the companys ngls the company also has contractual arrangements with williams ohio valley midstream llc to process natural gas and market a portion of its ngls on behalf of the company in its appalachian operations 

the following table presents the average sales price on a per mcfe basis to eqt for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without cash settled derivatives 



  

in addition price information for all products is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “average realized price reconciliation” and incorporated herein by reference 

  

natural gas marketing   eqt energy llc eqt energy the companys indirect wholly owned marketing subsidiary provides marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management primarily for the benefit of the company eqt energy also engages in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of the company the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices 

competition 

  

other natural gas producers compete with the company in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and ngls and the securing of services labor equipment and transportation required to conduct operations the companys competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers operators and marketing companies 

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

the company’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing the company’s natural gas resources 

the company’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties kentucky ohio virginia and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia the company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus and upper devonian acreage in 2013 the pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas various states also impose certain regulatory requirements to transfer wells to third parties or discontinue operations in the event of divestitures by the company 

the companys gathering operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

in 2010 congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that established federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other cftc rules that may be relevant to the company have yet to be finalized because significant cftc rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company has experienced increased and anticipates additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

regulators periodically review or audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the company 

the following is a summary of some of the existing laws rules and regulations to which the companys business operations are subject 

natural gas sales and transportation 

  

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation including regulation of the terms conditions and rates for interstate transportation storage and various other matters primarily by the ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation the ferc’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 

historically federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas the company produces and the manner in which the company markets its production the ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of 1938 nga and the natural gas policy act of 1978 various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and nonprice controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales which include all of the companys sales of its own production under the energy policy act of 2005 the ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties of over 1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation while the companys production activities have not been regulated by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga the company is required to report aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions utilize contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices in addition congress may enact legislation or the ferc may adopt regulations that may subject certain of the companys otherwise nonferc jurisdictional facilities to further regulation failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject the company to civil penalty liability 

the cftc also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas with regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities and any related hedging activities that the company undertakes the company is thus required to observe antimarket manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the ferc andor the cftc the cftc also holds substantial enforcement authority including the ability to assess civil penalties 

the ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which the company may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity which affects the marketing of natural gas that the company produces as well as the revenues the company receives for sales of natural gas and release of its natural gas pipeline capacity commencing in 1985 the ferc promulgated a series of orders regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas today interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers marketers and other shippers regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company the ferc’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from thirdparty sellers other than pipelines however the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated therefore the company cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can the company determine what effect if any future regulatory changes might have on the company’s natural gas related activities 

under the ferc’s current regulatory regime transmission services must be provided on an openaccess nondiscriminatory basis at costbased rates or at marketbased rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters section 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga although the ferc has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a nonjurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function the ferc’s determinations as to the classification of facilities are done on a casebycase basis to the extent that the ferc issues an order that reclassifies certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities and depending on the scope of that decision the companys costs of transporting gas to point of sale locations may increase the company believes that the thirdparty natural gas pipelines on which its gas is gathered meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas 

company however the distinction between the fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of those gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatorytake requirements although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 

oil and ngls price controls and transportation rates 

sales prices of oil and ngls are not currently regulated and are made at market prices the companys sales of these commodities are however subject to laws and to regulations issued by the federal trade commission ftc prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market the ftc holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations including the ability to assess civil penalties of over 1 million per day per violation the companys sales of these commodities and any related hedging activities are also subject to cftc oversight as discussed above 

the price the company receives from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market some of the companys transportation of oil natural gas and ngls is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective as of january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations the ferc’s regulation of crude oil and ngls transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipelines although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry the company is not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or ferc proceedings if any on the transportation costs associated with crude oil production from the companys crude oil producing operations 

environmental health and safety regulation 

the business operations of the company are also subject to numerous stringent federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing operating and abandoning wells and related facilities violations of these laws can result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier and other protected areas or areas with endangered or threatened species restrictions require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production 

moreover the trend has been for stricter regulation of activities that have the potential to affect the environment additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by congress federal agencies the states local governments and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective therefore the company is unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance the regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability the company has established procedures however for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to track compliance with regulatory policies and procedures 

the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and workplace safety laws and regulations as amended from time to time to which the companys business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition earnings or cash flows 

hazardous substances and waste handling  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous 

substance” into the environment these persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in addition despite the “petroleum exclusion” of section 10114 of cercla which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas the company generates materials in the course of its operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances based on their characteristics however the company is unaware of any liabilities arising under cercla for which the company may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect the company 

the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws establish detailed requirements for the generation handling storage treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes rcra specifically excludes drilling fluids produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes however these wastes may be regulated by the epa or state agencies under rcra’s less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions or under state laws or other federal laws moreover it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future for example in december 2016 the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess its rcra subtitle d criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra the consent decree requires the epa to propose a rulemaking no later than march 15 2019 for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary the epa would be required to complete any rulemaking revising the subtitle d criteria by 2021 a loss of the rcra exclusion for drilling fluids produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in the companys costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition 

the company currently owns leases or operates numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production activities for many years although the company believes that it has utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on under or from the properties owned or leased by the company or on under or from other locations including offsite locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal in addition some of the companys properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under the companys control the company is able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which the company acts or has acted as operator the failure of a prior owner or operator to comply with applicable environmental regulations may in certain circumstances be attributed to the company as current owner or operator under cercla these properties and the substances disposed or released on under or from them may be subject to cercla rcra and analogous state laws under such laws the company could be required to undertake response or corrective measures regardless of fault which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or waste pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 

water discharges  the federal water pollution control act or the clean water act cwa and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes into federal and state waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or a state equivalent agency the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters including wetlands is also prohibited unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers corps in september 2015 the epa and the corps issued a final rule defining the scope of the epa’s and the corps’ jurisdiction over waters of the united states wotus but several legal challenges to the rule followed and the wotus rule was stayed nationwide in october 2015 pending resolution of the court challenges the epa and the corps proposed a rule in june 2017 to repeal the wotus rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the cwa’s jurisdiction in january 2018 the us supreme court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the wotus rule resides with the federal district courts consequently the previously filed district court cases were allowed to proceed resulting in a patchwork of implementation in some states and stays in others following the us supreme court’s decision the epa and the corps issued a final rule in january 2018 staying implementation of the wotus rule for two years while the agencies reconsider the rule but a federal judge barred the agencies’ suspension of the rule in august 2018 subsequently various district court decisions revived the wotus rule in 22 states the district of columbia and the us territories and have enjoined implementation of the rule in 28 states in december 2018 the epa and the corps released a proposal to redefine the definition of wotus the new proposed definition narrows the scope of waters that are covered as jurisdictional under the wotus rule this proposed definition may be subject to an expanded comment period and future litigation as a result future implementation of the wotus rule is uncertain at this time to the extent this rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the cwa’s jurisdiction the company could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas which could delay the development of the companys natural gas 

and oil projects also pursuant to these laws and regulations the company may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or stormwater and to develop and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc plans in connection with onsite storage of significant quantities of oil these laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal remediation and damages 

air emissions  the federal clean air act caa and comparable state laws regulate the emission of air pollutants from many sources such as for example tank batteries and compressor stations through air emissions standards construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain pre‑approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants the costs of which could be significant the need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of the companys oil and natural gas projects over the next several years the company may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues for example in october 2015 the epa lowered the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8hour primary and secondary standards and completed attainmentnonattainment designations in july 2018 states are expected to implement more stringent permitting requirements as a result of the final rule which could apply to the companys operations while the epa has determined that all counties in which the company operates are in attainment with the new ozone standards these determinations may be revised in the future reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new facilities or modify existing facilities in these newly designated nonattainment areas compliance with these more stringent standards and other environmental regulations could delay or prohibit the companys ability to obtain permits for its operations or require the companys to install additional pollution control equipment the costs of which could be significant 

climate change and regulation of “greenhouse gas” emissions  in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases ghg present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that among other things establish prevention of significant deterioration psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal or criteria pollutant emissions facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a case‑by‑case basis these epa rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay the companys ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources in addition the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of the companys operations for example in december 2015 the epa finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting rule these new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells the revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities these changes to the epa’s ghg emissions reporting rule could result in increased compliance costs 

in june 2016 the epa finalized new regulations that establish new source performance standards nsps known as subpart ooooa for methane and volatile organic compounds voc from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities while the epa has taken several steps to delay implementation of its methane standards to date the courts have generally ruled that such attempts have been unlawful in september 2018 the epa proposed amendments to the 2016 subpart ooooa standards that would reduce the 2016 rule’s fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expand exceptions to pneumatic pump requirements among other changes various industry and environmental groups have separately challenged both the methane requirements and the epa’s attempts to delay the implementation of the rule in addition in april 2018 several states filed a lawsuit seeking to compel the epa to issue methane performance standards for existing sources in the oil and natural gas source category as a result of the actions described above the company cannot predict with certainty the scope of any final methane regulations or the costs for complying with federal methane regulations 

at the state level several states have proceeded with regulation targeting ghg emissions for example in june 2018 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep released revised versions of gp5 and gp5a pennsylvania’s general air permits applicable to processing plants and well site operations among other facilities these permits apply to new or modified sources constructed on or after august 8 2018 with emissions below certain specified thresholds gp5 and gp5a impose “best available technology” bat standards which are in addition to and in many cases more stringent than the federal nsps these bat standards include a 200 ton per year limit on methane emissions above which a bat requirement for methane emissions control applies moreover in december 2018 the padep released a draft proposed rulemaking for emissions of vocs and other pollutants for existing sources state regulations such as these could impose increased compliance costs on the companys operations 

while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting ghgs while pennsylvania is not currently a member of the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi a multistate regional cap and trade program comprised of several eastern us states it is possible that it may join rggi in the future this could result in increased operating costs if the companys operations are required to purchase emission allowances 

on an international level the united states is one of almost 200 nations that in december 2015 agreed to an international climate change agreement in paris france that calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its ghg emissions targets paris agreement the paris agreement was signed by the united states in april 2016 and entered into force on november 4 2016 however the paris agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants in august 2017 the us department of state officially informed the united nations of the united states’ intent to withdraw from the paris agreement the paris agreement provides for a fouryear exit process beginning when it took effect in november 2016 which would result in an effective exit date of november 2020 the united states’ adherence to the exit process andor the terms on which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact the companys business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from the companys equipment and operations could require the company to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas the company produces and lower the value of its reserves 

notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change the international energy agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades however recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energyrelated assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of finding for the energy sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while the company cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to the companys assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on the companys exploration and production operations 

hydraulic fracturing activities  vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near the companys drilling locations the company conducts baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of the companys drilling pads 

hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act sdwa over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and issued permitting guidance in february 2014 regarding such activities the epa also finalized rules in june 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants 

certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices for example in december 2016 the epa released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources the final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local or regionalscale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts water 

withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids chemicals or produced water injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits because the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources this yearslong study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level 

in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities for example in january 2016 the padep issued new rules establishing stricter disposal requirements for wastes associated with hydraulic fracturing activities which include among other things a prohibition on the use of centralized impoundments for the storage of drill cuttings and waste fluids further these rules include requirements relating to storage tank security secondary containment for storage vessels construction rules for gathering lines and horizontal drilling under streams and temporary transport lines for freshwater and wastewater local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the company operates the company could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells 

occupational safety and health act  the company is also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha as amended and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees in addition osha’s hazard communication standard the emergency planning and community right to know act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in the companys operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and citizens 

endangered species act  the federal endangered species act esa provides for the protection of endangered and threatened species pursuant to the esa if a species is listed as threatened or endangered restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the migratory bird treaty act the us fish and wildlife service fws may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species a critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit access to protected areas for natural gas and oil development further the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause the company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on the companys exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on the companys ability to develop and produce reserves

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position   

our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position depend upon the prices for natural gas ngls and oil the prices for natural gas ngls and oil have historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include 

• weather conditions and seasonal trends 

• the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for natural gas ngls and oil 

 

the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 688 per mmbtu to a low of 248 per mmbtu from january 1 2018 through december 31 2018 and the daily spot prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 7741 per barrel to a low of 4448 per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years because our production and reserves predominantly consist of natural gas approximately 94  of equivalent proved developed reserves changes in natural gas prices have significantly greater impact on our financial results than oil prices ngls are made up of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics which adds further volatility to the pricing of ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas oil and ngls at the companys ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations 

prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas ngls and oil prices may adversely affect our revenues operating income cash flows and financial position particularly if we are unable to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngls and oil prices declines in prices could also adversely affect our drilling activities and the amount of natural gas ngls and oil that we can produce economically which may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur noncash impairment charges to earnings in future periods reductions in cash flows from lower commodity prices may require us to incur additional borrowings or to reduce our capital spending which could reduce our production and our reserves negatively affecting our future rate of growth lower prices for natural gas ngls and oil may also adversely affect our credit ratings and result in a reduction in our borrowing capacity and access to other capital see “impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including long lived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods” we are also exposed to the risk 

of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in our derivative contracts having a positive fair value in our favor further adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our hedge counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection 

increases in natural gas ngls and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral provided to our hedge counterparties which is interestbearing is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

drilling for and producing natural gas and oil are highrisk and costly activities with many uncertainties our future financial position cash flows and results of operations will depend on the success of our development and acquisition activities which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable natural gas or oil production or that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 

our decisions to purchase explore or develop prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses production data and engineering studies the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes see “our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves” in addition our cost of drilling completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences 

further many factors may curtail delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects including the following 

 

any of these risks can cause a delay in our development program or result in substantial losses including personal injury or loss of life damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 

our drilling locations are scheduled out over many years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling in addition we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill our drilling locations 

our management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain well locations as an estimation of our future multiyear drilling activities on our existing acreage these well locations represent a significant part of our business strategy our 

ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including natural gas ngls and oil prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs the availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations topography gathering system and pipeline transportation costs and constraints access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems coordination with coal mining regulatory approvals and other factors because of these uncertain factors we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas ngls or oil from these or any other drilling locations in addition unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained the leases for such acreage will expire further certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling or unitization with adjacent leaseholds controlled by third parties if these third parties are unwilling to pool or unitize such leaseholds with ours the total locations we can drill may be limited as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified 

in addition we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful may not increase our overall production levels and proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations for more information on our drilling locations see “item 2 properties” 

the amount and timing of actual future natural gas ngls and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

because the rate of production from natural gas and oil wells and associated ngls generally declines as reserves are depleted our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngls and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that perform below expectations or do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit low natural gas ngls and oil prices may further limit the types of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves conduct successful exploration and development activities or through engineering studies identify additional behindpipe zones or secondary recovery reserves our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced future natural gas ngls and oil production therefore is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable we cannot be certain that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with efficient operation of existing wells our reserves and production together with associated revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs some of which are beyond our control these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows to the extent we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved although we believe our estimates are reasonable actual production revenues and costs to develop reserves will likely vary from estimates and these variances could be material numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and oil reserves 

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil the amount timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves and thus their actual present value in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngls and oil industry in general 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial position and reduce our future growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including well development reserve acquisitions exploratory activities corporate items leasehold maintenance and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital    notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify and execute optimal business strategies including the appropriate corporate structure and appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial position and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms 

our business is capital intensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the development and acquisition of natural gas ngls and oil reserves we typically fund our capital expenditures with existing cash and cash generated by operations and to the extent our capital expenditures exceed our cash resources from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other external sources of capital if we do not have sufficient borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility due to the current commodity price environment or otherwise we may seek alternate debt or equity financing sell assets or reduce our capital expenditures the issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of among other things natural gas prices actual drilling results the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory technological and competitive developments 

our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including 

• our level of proved reserves and production 

• the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells 

• our access to and the cost of accessing end markets for our production 

• the prices at which our production is sold 

• our ability to acquire locate and produce new reserves 

• the levels of our operating expenses and 

• our ability to access the public or private capital markets or borrow under our revolving credit facility 

if our cash flows from operations or the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to fund our capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain the capital necessary for our planned capital budget or our operations we could be required to curtail our operations and the development of our properties which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position 

as of december 31 2018 our senior notes were rated “baa3” by moody’s investors services moody’s with a stable outlook “bbb” by standard  poor’s ratings service sp with a stable outlook and “bbb” by fitch ratings service fitch with a stable outlook although we are not aware of any current plans of moody’s sp or fitch to lower their respective ratings on our senior notes we cannot be assured that our credit rating will not be downgraded or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency low prices for natural gas ngls and oil or an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our senior notes if any credit rating agency downgrades our ratings particularly below investment grade our access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits on our derivatives would increase we may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of pipeline capacity contracts the amount of which may be substantial or we may be required to provide additional credit assurances related to joint venture arrangements or construction contracts which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity investment grade refers to the quality of a company’s credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies in order to be considered investment grade a company must be rated “bbb” or higher by sp “baa3” or higher by moody’s and “bbb” or higher by fitch 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately  54974 million  of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

 

our debt agreements also require compliance with certain covenants if the price that we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance for more information about our debt agreements please read “capital resources and liquidity” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks 

our business and operating results can be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or other increases in the cost of capital resulting from a reduction in our credit rating or otherwise these changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce cash flow used for operating and capital expenditures and place us at a competitive disadvantage 

disruptions or volatility in the financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve favorable operating results in addition we are exposed to credit risk related to our revolving credit facility to the extent that one or more of our lenders may be unable to provide necessary funding to us under our existing revolving line of credit if it experiences liquidity problems 

derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 

to manage our exposure to price risk we currently and may in the future enter into derivative arrangements utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a portion of our future production such hedges are designed to lock in prices so as to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow these transactions limit our potential gains if natural gas ngls and oil prices rise above the price established by the hedge in addition derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which 

• our production is less than expected 

• the counterparties to our derivatives contracts fail to perform on their contract obligations or 

• an event materially impacts natural gas ngls or oil prices or the relationship between the hedged price index and the natural gas ngls or oil sales price 

we cannot be certain that any derivative transaction we may enter into will adequately protect us from declines in the prices of natural gas ngls or oil furthermore where we choose not to engage in derivative transactions in the future we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas ngls or oil prices than our competitors who engage in derivative transactions lower natural gas ngls and oil prices may also negatively impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts at favorable prices 

derivative transactions also expose us to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract or enters bankruptcy or encounters some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint in this case we may not be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase which increases our exposure if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance we could incur a significant loss 

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells and facilities 

our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to drilling for producing transporting and storing natural gas ngls and oil such as fires explosions slips landslides blowouts and well cratering pipe and other equipment and system failures delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities adverse weather conditions such as freeze offs of wells and pipelines due to cold weather issues related to compliance with environmental regulations environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks oil spills pipeline and tank ruptures encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials and unauthorized releases of brine well stimulation and completion fluids toxic gases or other pollutants into the environment especially those that reach surface water or groundwater inadvertent third party damage to our assets and natural disasters we also face various risks or threats to the operation and security of our or third parties’ facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants compressor stations and pipelines any of these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property equipment and natural resources pollution or other environmental damage loss of hydrocarbons disruptions to our operations regulatory investigations and penalties suspension of our operations repair and remediation costs and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable and we may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

cyber incidents targeting our systems or natural gas and oil industry systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations 

our business and the natural gas and oil industry in general have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies we depend on this technology to record and store data estimate quantities of natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers control nearly all of the natural gas ngls and oil distribution systems in the us which are necessary to transport our products to market 

the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our systems or infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas ngls and oil difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve and cyberattackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents the cost to remedy an unintended dissemination of sensitive information or data may be significant furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

failure to timely develop our leased real property could result in increased capital expenditures andor impairment of our leases 

mineral rights are typically owned by individuals who may enter into property leases with us to allow for the development of natural gas such leases expire after an initial term typically five years unless certain actions are taken to preserve the lease if we cannot preserve a lease the lease terminates 26 of our net undeveloped acres are subject to leases that could expire over the next three years lack of access to capital changes in government regulations changes in future development plans reduced drilling activity or the reduction in the fair value of undeveloped properties in the areas in which we operate could impact our ability to preserve trade or sell our leases prior to their expiration resulting in the termination and impairment of leases for properties which we have not developed 

capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded lease impairments and expirations of 2797 million  76 million  and 157 million  respectively refer to note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 

our inability to cure any title defects in our leases in a timely and cost efficient manner may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

substantially all of our producing properties are concentrated in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area 

substantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the appalachian basin as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by and costs associated with governmental regulation state and local political activities processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations availability of equipment and personnel water shortages or other weather related conditions interruption of the processing or transportation of oil natural gas or ngls and changes in state and local laws judicial precedents political regimes and regulations such conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in addition a number of areas within the appalachian basin have historically been subject to mining operations for example thirdparties may engage in subsurface coal and other mining operations near or under our properties which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties adversely impact our drilling operations or adversely impact thirdparty midstream activities on which we rely in such event our operations may be impaired or interrupted and we may not be able to recover the costs incurred as a result of temporary shutins or the plugging and abandonment of any of our wells furthermore the existence of mining operations near our properties could require coordination to avoid adverse impacts as a result of drilling and mining in close proximity these restrictions on our operations and any similar restrictions could cause delays or interruptions or prevent us from executing our business strategy which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

further insufficient takeaway capacity in the appalachian basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized natural gas prices the appalachian basin has recently experienced periods in which production has surpassed local takeaway capacity resulting in substantial discounts in the price received by producers such as us and others at times being possibly shut in although additional appalachian basin takeaway capacity has been added in recent years the existing and expected capacity may not be sufficient to keep pace with the increased production caused by accelerated drilling in the area in the short term 

due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties 

natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including long lived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods   

we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties and goodwill for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in addition we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations because the results are based on estimated future events and estimated future cash flows the estimated future cash flows used to test our proved oil and gas properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by our management for internal planning and budgeting purposes key assumptions used in our analyses include among other things the intended use of the asset the anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil future operating costs inflation and the anticipated proceeds which may be received upon divestiture if there is a possibility that the asset will be divested prior to the end of its useful life commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality locational basis adjustments and inflation proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value when testing goodwill for impairment we also consider the market value of our common stock and other valuation techniques when determining the fair value of our single reporting unit 

future declines in natural gas ngls or oil prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance among other things may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves andor could result in additional noncash impairment charges to writedown the carrying amount of our assets including other long lived intangible assets which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 

any impairment of our assets including other long lived intangible assets would require us to take an immediate charge to earnings such charges could be material to our results of operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position see “impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs completion services equipment supplies personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis 

the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations geologists geophysicists engineers and other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices causing periodic shortages or higher costs historically there have been shortages of personnel and equipment as demand for personnel and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and if so what their timing and duration will be such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

our ability to drill for and produce natural gas and oil is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for drilling and completion operations and access to water and waste disposal or recycling services at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of produced water and other waste may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to drill and complete natural gas and oil wells requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water our ability to access sources of water and the availability of disposal alternatives to receive all of the water produced from our wells and used in hydraulic fracturing may affect our drilling and completion operations our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations or to timely obtain water sourcing permits or other rights could adversely affect our operations additionally the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of waste which would adversely affect our business and results of operations which could result in decreased cash flows 

in addition federal and state regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for natural gas and oil waste disposal and increased seismic activity in certain areas in some cases operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity in the states where we operate could lead to restrictions on our disposal well injection volumes and increased scrutiny of and delay in obtaining new disposal well permits which could result in increased operating costs which could be material or a curtailment of our operations 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to identify attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with identifying attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot identify attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete in our industry could be harmed 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties many of our competitors have financial resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on existing and changing processes and may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we depend upon equitrans midstream a thirdparty midstream provider for a significant portion of our midstream services and our failure to obtain and maintain access to the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas ngls and oil to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

our delivery of natural gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities primarily owned by thirdparties and our ability to contract with these thirdparties the capacity of transmission gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties competition for access to pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense and our ability to secure access to pipeline infrastructure on favorable economic terms could affect our competitive position 

historically our ownership interest in and control of eqm midstream partners lp eqm and rice midstream partners lp rmp allowed us to exercise greater control over the development of midstream infrastructure to service our operations however as a result of the separation we no longer control those operations and facilities and will be dependent on equitrans midstream and other thirdparty providers of these services access to midstream assets may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may occur more slowly a lack of access to needed infrastructure or an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including vandalism sabotage or cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil in addition some of our thirdparty contracts involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part and could reduce our cash flow during periods of low prices for natural gas ngls and oil our usage of third parties for transmission gathering and processing services subjects us to the performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market to the extent these services are delayed or unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

finally in order to ensure access to certain midstream facilities we have entered into agreements that obligate us to pay demand charges to various pipeline operators we also have commitments with third parties for processing capacity we may be obligated to make payments under these agreements even if we do not fully utilize the capacity we have reserved and these payments may be significant 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines oil spills and concerns raised by advocacy groups or the media about hydraulic fracturing greenhouse gas or methane emissions or fossil fuels in general or about royalty payment and surface use issues may lead to increased litigation and regulatory legislative and judicial scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations in safety environmental royalty and surface use areas these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed challenged or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

we are subject to complex federal state local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities 

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells and related infrastructure our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of water and other fluids and materials including solid and hazardous wastes incidental to natural gas and oil operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of properties some states allow the statutory pooling and unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration as well as joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and natural gas and oil laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air ground and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed and work practices related to employee health and safety 

to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits approvals and certificates from various federal state and local governmental authorities maintaining compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas ngls and oil resources these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages in addition our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations such costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages as well as corrective action costs 

in december 2018 changes to certain federal income tax laws were signed into law which impact us including but not limited to changes to the regular income tax rate the elimination of the alternative minimum tax full expensing of capital equipment limited deductibility of interest expense and increased limitations on deductible executive compensation the current administration continues to debate further changes to federal income tax laws that could be enacted which could have a material impact on us the most significant potential tax law changes include further changes to the regular income tax rate the expensing of intangible drilling costs or percentage depletion and further limited deductibility of interest expense any of which could adversely impact our current and deferred federal and state income tax liabilities state and local taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate or own assets may enact new taxes such as the imposition of a severance tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce natural gas ngls and oil or change the rates of existing taxes which could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

in 2010 congress adopted the doddfrank act which established federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including us such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other rules that may be relevant to us or our counterparties have yet to be finalized because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on our hedging program including available counterparties or regulatory compliance obligations we have experienced increased and anticipate additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

federal state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of natural gas and oil wells which could adversely affect our production 

we utilize hydraulic fracturing in the completion of our natural gas and oil wells hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state natural gas and oil commissions but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority for example the epa also finalized rules in june 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants 

certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells see businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation” for more information 

our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 

we may incur significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration development and production activities these delays costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and workplace safety including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time resulting in longer waiting periods to receive permits and other regulatory approvals failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and in some instances issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations 

strict joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental and occupational health and workplace safety impacts of our operations we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such matters 

in addition new or additional laws and regulations new interpretations of existing requirements or changes in enforcement policies could impose unforeseen liabilities significantly increase compliance costs or result in delays of or denial of rights to conduct our development programs for example in september 2015 the epa and the corps issued a final rule under the cwa defining the scope of the epa’s and the corps’ jurisdiction over wotus but several legal challenges to the rule followed and the wotus rule was stayed nationwide in october 2015 pending resolution of the court challenges the epa and the corps proposed a rule in june 2017 to repeal the wotus rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the cwa’s jurisdiction in january 2018 the us supreme court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the wotus rule resides with the federal district courts consequently the previously filed district court cases were allowed to proceed resulting in a patchwork of implementation in some states and stays in others following the us supreme court’s decision the epa and the corps issued a final rule in january 2018 staying implementation of the wotus rule for two years while the agencies reconsider the rule but a federal judge barred the agencies’ suspension of the rule in august 2018 subsequently various district court decisions 

revived the wotus rule in 22 states the district of columbia and the us territories and enjoined implementation of the rule in 28 states in december 2018 the epa and the corps released a proposal to redefine the definition of wotus the new proposed definition narrows the scope of waters that are covered as jurisdictional under the wotus rule the proposed definition may be subject to an expanded comment period and future litigation as a result future implementation of the wotus rule is uncertain at this time to the extent the wotus rule expands the scope of the cwa’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas such potential regulations or litigation could increase our operating costs reduce our liquidity delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position further the discharges of natural gas ngls oil and other pollutants into the air soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties 

regulations related to the protection of wildlife could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 

our operations can be adversely affected by regulations designed to protect various wildlife the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in constraints on our exploration and production activities this limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 

conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil 

fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil the impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas ngls and oil that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 

in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that among other things establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal or criteria pollutant emissions facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a case‑by‑case basis these epa rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources in addition the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of our operations at the state level several states including pennsylvania have proceeded with regulation targeting ghg emissions such state regulations could impose increased compliance costs on our operations 

while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs while pennsylvania is not currently a member of the rggi a multistate regional cap and trade program comprised of several eastern us states it is possible that it may join rggi in the future this could result in increased operating costs if our operations are required to purchase emission allowances 

on an international level the united states is one of almost 200 nations that in december 2015 agreed to the paris agreement which calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its ghg emissions targets the paris agreement was signed by the united states in april 2016 and entered into force on november 4 2016 however the paris agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants in august 2017 the us department of state officially informed the united nations of the united states’ intent to withdraw from the paris agreement the paris agreement provides for a fouryear exit process beginning when it took effect in november 2016 which would result in an effective exit date of november 2020 the united states’ adherence to the exit process andor the terms on which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time 

although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the natural gas ngls and oil we produce and lower the value of our reserves 

notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change the international energy agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040 and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades however recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energyrelated assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of finding for the energy sector moreover activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbonintensive activities while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities 

finally it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods droughts and other extreme climatic events if any such effects were to occur they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations see “businessregulationenvironmental health and safety regulation” for more information 

the growth of our business through strategic transactions may expose us to various risks 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory and third party approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions competition for transaction opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing transactions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little or partial control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

acquisitions may disrupt our current plans or operations and may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities we may not achieve the intended benefits of our acquisition of rice energy inc 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas ngls and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well or lease that we acquire and even when we inspect a well or lease we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

on november 13 2017 we completed the acquisition of rice energy inc rice there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate rice’s assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of rice in addition our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations going forward the integration has required and will continue to require significant time and focus from management and could disrupt current plans and operations which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives 

changes in our business following the completion of recent significant transactions including the acquisition of rice and the separation and distribution may result in disruptions to our business and negatively impact our operations and our relationships with our customers and business partners 

over the last two years we have completed multiple significant transactions including the acquisition of rice and the separation and distribution with material work to be completed to achieve synergies and rationalize operations as a result of these transactions our company and employees have experienced significant changes including the departure of members of senior management new leadership in significant roles and employee reassignments necessary in connection with the separation as well as a reduction in our workforce the combination of these factors may materially adversely affect our operations further uncertainty related to our business following the separation may lead customers and other parties to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and prospects 

the separation and distribution may subject us to future liabilities 

  

in november 2018 we completed the separation and distribution resulting in the spinoff of equitrans midstream a standalone publicly traded corporation which holds our former midstream business 

  

pursuant to agreements we entered into with equitrans midstream in connection with the separation we and equitrans midstream are each generally responsible for the obligations and liabilities related to our respective businesses pursuant to those agreements we and equitrans midstream each agreed to crossindemnities principally designed to allocate financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business to us and those of equitrans midstream’s business to it however third parties including governmental agencies could seek to hold us responsible for obligations and liabilities that equitrans midstream agreed to retain or assume and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from equitrans midstream will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities or that equitrans midstream will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations additionally if a court were to determine that the separation or related transactions were consummated with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in equitrans midstream receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent or that it was rendered insolvent inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and equitrans midstream impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us and void some or all of the separationrelated transactions any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

if there is a later determination that the distribution or certain related transactions are taxable for us federal income tax purposes because the facts assumptions representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling andor opinion of counsel are incorrect or for any other reason we could incur significant liabilities 

in connection with the separation and distribution we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the us internal revenue code the code and certain other us federal income tax matters relating to the distribution and certain related transactions the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel are based upon and rely on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of us and equitrans midstream including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and equitrans midstream if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if we or equitrans midstream breach any representations or covenants contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel 

notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine on audit that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the ruling or for other reasons including as as result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of the company or equitrans midstream after the distribution further described below an opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in such opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we equitrans midstream and our shareholders could be subject to material us federal and state income tax liabilities in connection with the separation we 

and equitrans midstream entered into a tax matters agreement which described the sharing of any such liabilities between us and equitrans midstream 

even if the distribution otherwise qualifies as generally taxfree under section 355 and section 368a1d of the code the company but not shareholders would be subject to material us federal and state income tax liability under section 355e of the code if one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly a 50percent or greater interest measured by either vote or value in our stock or in the stock of equitrans midstream excluding for this purpose the acquisition of stock of equitrans midstream by holders of our stock in the distribution as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution any acquisition of our stock or stock of equitrans midstream or any predecessor or successor corporation within two years before or after the distribution generally would be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the distribution although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances additionally equitrans midstream is subject to certain agreements entered into with us that restrict within two years of the distribution the ability of equitrans midstream to engage in certain corporate transactions without obtaining an advance ruling from the irs and our prior consent the process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling or any opinion of counsel described above we or equitrans midstream may cause or permit a change in ownership of our stock or stock of equitrans midstream sufficient to result in a material tax liability to us 

the separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits 

we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits from the separation as independent publiclytraded companies we and equitrans midstream are smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially adversely affect our and its results of operations cash flows and financial position further we may be required to expend additional resources to consolidate andor upgrade our information technology processes and systems to achieve our strategic goals 

we are a significant shareholder of equitrans midstream and the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may fluctuate substantially 

we own approximately 199 of the outstanding shares of common stock of equitrans midstream the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may be adversely affected by negative changes in its results of operations cash flows and financial position which may occur as a result of the many risks attendant with operating in the midstream industry including loss of gathering and transportation volumes the effect of laws and regulations on the operation of its business and development of its assets increased competition loss of contracted volumes adverse ratemaking decisions policies and rulings by the ferc delays in the timing of or the failure to complete expansion projects lack of access to capital and operating risks and hazards 

we intend to dispose of our interest in equitrans midstream through one or more exchanges of our shares of equitrans midstream common stock for our debt or one or more sales of such shares for cash however we can offer no assurance that we will be able to complete such disposition or as to the value we will realize the occurrence of any of these and other risks faced by equitrans midstream could adversely affect the value of our investment in equitrans midstream 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us 

we may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings we may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities 

we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock

 item 2     properties 

  

principal facilities are owned or in the case of certain office locations warehouse buildings and equipment leased by the company and its subsidiaries the majority of the company’s properties are located on or under i private properties owned in fee held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles or ii public highways under franchises or permits from various governmental authorities the company’s facilities are generally well maintained and where appropriate are replaced or expanded to meet operating requirements 

  

the company’s properties are located primarily in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio the company has approximately 14 million  gross acres approximately 74  of which are considered undeveloped which encompass substantially all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil producing properties of these gross acres approximately 11 million  are in the marcellus play much of which has associated deep utica or upper devonian drilling rights and approximately 01 million  are in the ohio utica play although most of the companys wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths  5000  to 8500  feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2018  the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 218  tcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 113  tcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 02  tcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 103  tcfe substantially all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations 

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngls and oil reserves is prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for preparing the reserve report and the technical aspects of the reserves audit received a bachelor’s degree 

in chemical engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has 21 years of experience in the oil and gas industry to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally division of interest and production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve reconciliation between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngls and oil reserves is audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp ryder scott which is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally in the course of its audit ryder scott reviewed 100  of the total net natural gas ngls and oil proved reserves attributable to the company’s interests as of december 31 2018  ryder scott conducted a detailed well by well audit of the company’s largest properties this audit covered 81  of the company’s proved developed reserves ryder scott’s audit of the remaining approximately 19  of the company’s proved developed properties consisted of an audit of aggregated groups not exceeding 200  wells per case for operated wells and 115  wells per case for nonoperated wells for undeveloped locations the company determined and ryder scott reviewed and approved the areas within the company’s acreage considered to be proven reserves were assigned and projected by the company’s reserves engineers for locations within these proven areas and approved by ryder scott based on analogous type curves and offset production information ryder scott’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 99 

  

no  report has been filed with any federal authority or agency reflecting a 5  or more difference from the company’s estimated total reserves additional information relating to the company’s estimates of natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows is provided in note 18  unaudited to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2018  the company commenced drilling operations spud or drilled on 117  gross horizontal marcellus wells 5  gross horizontal upper devonian wells and 31  gross horizontal ohio utica wells sales volumes in 2018  from the marcellus play including the upper devonian play was 1230  bcfe over the past five  years the company has experienced a 97  developmental drilling success rate 

natural gas ngls and crude oil pricing 



for additional information on pricing see “average realized price reconciliation” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the company’s average per unit production cost excluding production taxes of natural gas ngls and oil during 2018 2017 and 2016 was 007  per mcfe 013  per mcfe and 015  per mcfe respectively 

summary of productive and in process natural gas and oil wells at december 31 2018 



  

summary of proved natural gas oil and ngls reserves as of december 31 2018  based on average fiscal year prices 





as of december 31 2018  the company had no  proved undeveloped reserves that had remained undeveloped for more than five years 

the company has an active lease renewal program in areas targeted for development in the event that production is not established or the company takes no action to extend or renew the terms of its leases the companys net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2018  is 90543 79107 and 54373 for the years ended december 31 2019  2020  and 2021  respectively 

  

number of net productive and dry exploratory and development wells drilled 



the dry developmental wells in 2018 and 2017 are primarily related to noncore wells no longer planned to be drilled to depth or completed and acquired wells with mechanical integrity issues the number of dry developmental wells drilled in 2016 were primarily related to vertical wells that are no longer planned to be drilled horizontally due to the uncertainty of identifying a nearterm pipeline solution 

  

the table below provides select production sales and acreage data by state as of december 31 2018  unless otherwise noted which is substantially all from the appalachian basin ngls and oil were converted to mcfe at the rate of six  mcfe per barrel for all periods refer to the average realized price reconciliation table in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for sales volumes by final product 



  

a all production information related to natural gas is reported net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of ngls 

b other primarily includes kentucky and virginia during 2018 as a result of the huron divestiture the company sold approximately 25 million  noncore net acres in the huron play however the company retained the deep drilling rights across the divested acreage in kentucky and virginia of 15 million and 02 million respectively which are excluded from the acreage totals above natural gas oil and ngls production and sales primarily represents activity prior to the completion of the 2018 divestitures 

 



the company sells natural gas and ngls within the appalachian basin and in markets accessible through its transportation portfolio under a variety of contractual agreements some of which specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities the company expects to fulfill these delivery commitments with existing proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2018  the company’s delivery commitments for the next five years were as follows 



  

during the year ended december 31 2018 the company’s total proved developed reserves increased by 252 bcfe the increase in proved developed reserves was primarily due to the conversion of approximately 2722  bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves an upward revision of 459 bcfe from processing ownership changes and other revisions and the addition of 315  bcfe due to extensions discoveries and other additions that were not previously recorded as proved reserves these increases were partly offset by the sale of hydrocarbons in place of 1749  bcfe associated with the 2018 divestitures as described in note 8 and 2018 production of 1495  bcfe 

the company’s 2018 extensions discoveries and other additions totaled 4739  bcfe which exceeded the 2018 production of 1495  bcfe of these 315  bcfe of proved developed reserves were extensions from reservoirs underlying acreage not previously booked as proved 886  bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves were extensions from acreage proved by drilling activity and 3538  bcfe of other proved undeveloped additions are associated with acreage that was excluded from prior year proved reserves bookings but subsequently became proved due to inclusion with the company’s five  year drilling plan 

the company’s 2018 revisions totaled a downward adjustment of 1125  bcfe which was primarily due to the removal of certain proved undeveloped locations that are no longer expected to be developed within 5 years of initial booking as proved reserves resulting from changes in company’s future development plans to focus more heavily on developing the company’s core pennsylvania assets

average realized price reconciliation 

  

the following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of the company’s consolidated operations including the calculation of the companys average realized price mcfe which is based on adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the company’s management to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons of earnings trends adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to total operating revenues see “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” for a reconciliation of adjusted operating revenues to total operating revenues 



  



reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

the table below reconciles adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure to total operating revenues its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

adjusted operating revenues also referred to as total natural gas  liquids sales including cash settled derivatives is presented because it is an important measure used by the company’s management to evaluate periodoverperiod comparisons of earnings trends adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of  net marketing services and other  management utilizes adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement adjusted operating revenues also excludes  net marketing services and other  because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production  net marketing services and other  primarily includes the cost of and recoveries on pipeline capacity not used for the companys sales volumes and revenues for gathering services management further believes that adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating periodoverperiod earnings trends 



sales volumes and revenues   



 

total operating revenues were 45579 million  for 2018  compared to 30910 million  for 2017  sales of natural gas oil and ngls increased as a result of a 68  increase in sales volumes in 2018  which was primarily a result of the rice merger and increased production from the 2016 and 2017 drilling programs partly offset by the 2018 divestitures and the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the average realized price decreased in 2018  compared to 2017  due to a decrease in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives and a decrease in higher priced liquids sales as a result of the 2018 divestitures partly offset by an increase in the average natural gas differential the company paid 2253 million  and received 407 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in loss gain on derivatives not designated as hedges the increase in the average differential primarily related to higher prices during the first quarter of 2018 at sales points in the united states northeast where colder weather led to increased demand higher appalachian basin basis as well as increased sales volumes at higher priced gulf coast and midwest markets accessible through the company’s increased transportation portfolio following the rice merger 

total operating revenues for 2018  included a 1786 million  loss on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a 3900 million  gain on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017  the loss in 2018  primarily related to decreases in the fair market value of the company’s 2018 nymex swaps and options and basis swaps from december 31 2017 through the date of settlement as a result of increases in the underlying prices throughout this period these losses were partly offset by increases in the fair market value of the companys open nymex positions at december 31 2018 due to a decrease in forward nymex during 2018 

total operating revenues were 30910 million  for 2017  compared to 13871 million  for 2016  sales of natural gas oil and ngls increased as a result of higher average realized price and a 17  increase in sales volumes in 2017  eqt received 407 million and 2794 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues the increase in sales volumes was primarily the result of acquisition activity including the rice merger as well as increased production from the 2015 and 2016 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus play partially offset by the normal production decline in the companys producing wells in 2017 

  

the 057  per mcfe increase in the average realized price for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily due to the 

increase in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of 029 per mcf an increase in the average natural gas differential of 019  per mcf and an increase in liquids prices the improvement in the average differential primarily 

related to more favorable basis partly offset by unfavorable cash settled basis swaps during 2017 basis improved in the appalachian basin and at sales points reached through the company’s transportation portfolio particularly in the united states northeast in addition the company started flowing its produced volumes to its rockies express pipeline capacity and texas eastern transmission gulf markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to basis for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 

total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  included a 3900 million  gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a 2490 million  loss on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31 2016  the gains for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily related to increases in the fair market value of the company’s nymex swaps due to decreased nymex prices partly offset by decreases in the fair market value of its basis swaps due to increased basis prices 

operating expenses   

the following presents information about certain of the companys operating expenses for each of the last three years 



gathering gathering expense increased on an absolute basis in 2018  compared to 2017  due to the 68  increase in sales volumes partly offset by a lower gathering rate per unit on gathering capacity acquired in the rice merger which also decreased the rate per mcfe gathering expense increased in 2017  compared to 2016  on an absolute basis due to increased gathering capacity and expense from the company’s 2016 and 2017 acquisitions 

transmission transmission expense increased on an absolute basis in 2018  compared to 2017  due to increased third party capacity incurred to move the company’s natural gas out of the appalachian basin primarily firm capacity acquired in connection with the rice merger the companys capacity on the rover pipeline which started in 2018 as well as an increase in the company’s firm capacity on columbia gas transmission pipeline which increased in the first quarter of 2018 these increases were partly offset by reduced firm capacity costs as a result of the huron divestiture transmission expense per mcfe decreased as a result of increased sales volumes in 2018  transmission expense increased on an absolute basis in 2017  compared to 2016  due to increased capacity incurred to move the company’s natural gas out of the appalachian basin during the fourth quarter of 2016 the company started flowing its produced volumes to its rockies express and texas eastern transmission gulf markets pipeline capacity additionally the companys firm capacity on rockies express pipeline increased in the first quarter of 2017 firm capacity acquired in connection with the rice merger also increased transmission expenses by approximately 242 million transmission expense per mcfe increased in 2017  compared to 2016  as the impact of the above items exceeded the 17  growth in sales volumes during the period 

processing processing expense decreased on an absolute basis in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily as a result of the 2018 divestitures and decreased on a per mcfe basis as a result of a 68  increase in sales volumes when combined with the impact 

of the 2018 divestitures processing expense increased on an absolute basis in 2017  compared to 2016  as a result of increased processing capacity acquired through acquisitions and higher volumes processed which is consistent with higher ethane and ngls sales volumes of approximately 50 in 2017 compared to 2016 these factors also contributed to an increase in processing expense on a per mcfe basis as they exceeded the offsetting impact of growth in sales volumes during the period 

loe loe decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily as a result of the 2018 divestitures and growth in sales volumes in 2018 partly offset by higher salt water disposal costs and personnel costs due to increased activity in the companys marcellus and utica operations excluding the costs related to the 2018 divestitures per unit loe was 005 per mcfe in 2018 as compared to a divestiture adjusted 007 per mcfe in 2017 loe increased on an absolute basis in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to increased salt water disposal costs as a result of increased activity in the company’s marcellus operations but decreased on a per mcfe basis due to the growth in sales volumes during the period 

production taxes production taxes increased on an absolute basis in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily as a result of the significant increase in the number of wells subject to the pennsylvania impact fee as well as the increased asset base and production volumes in ohio following the rice merger partly offset by the lower asset base and production volumes in kentucky west virginia virginia and texas following the 2018 divestitures production taxes decreased on a per mcfe basis in 2018  compared to 2017  due to an increase in sales volumes production taxes increased on an absolute basis in 2017  compared to 2016  as a result of higher market prices in 2017 in combination with an increase in the number of wells subject to the pennsylvania impact fee as well as an increased asset base and production from acquisitions 

exploration exploration expense decreased in 2018  compared to 2017  and increased in 2017  compared to 2016  on an absolute and per mcfe basis primarily due to expenses related to an exploratory well in a noncore operating area classified as a dry hole in 2017 

sga sga expense increased on an absolute basis in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to increased legal reserves increased charitable contributions to the eqt foundation and increased personnel costs associated with workforce reductions sga expense decreased on an absolute basis in 2017  compared 2016  primarily due to lower pension expense related to the termination of the eqt corporation retirement plan for employees in the second quarter of 2016 lower legal reserves in 2017 a reduction to the reserve for uncollectible accounts and the absence of costs related to the consolidation of the company’s huron operations in 2016 this was partly offset by higher costs associated with acquisitions sga expense per mcfe decreased in 2018  compared to 2017  and in 2017  compared 2016  due to an increase in sales volumes for each respective period 

depreciation and depletion  depreciation and depletion  increased as a result of higher produced volumes in 2018 partly offset by lower depreciation as a result of the 2018 divestitures depreciation and depletion  increased as a result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2017 compared to 2016 



impairment of longlived assets impairment of longlived assets increased 27100 million  in 2018  compared 2017  related to the 2018 divestitures see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the asset impairment

lease impairments and expirations  lease impairments and expirations increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in the amount of leases that expired during 2018 that were primarily located in noncontiguous or noncore development areas and for impairments of leases not yet expired that are not expected to be drilled or extended prior to expiration during 2019 the increase in the number of leases expiring in 2018 and 2019 is primarily due to acquisition activity completed by the company throughout 2016 and 2017 in addition to the rice merger lease impairments and expirations decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the number of leases that expired in 2017 and impairments recorded in 2016 for leases not yet expired that would not be drilled prior to expiration 

transaction costs transaction costs in 2018  and 2017  were primarily legal and banking fees related to the rice merger transaction costs associated with the separation and distribution and a proportionate share of the transaction costs associated with the rice merger were allocated to discontinued operations as described in note 2  to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

amortization of intangible assets in connection with the rice merger the company obtained intangible assets composed of noncompete agreements with former rice executives amortization expense for 2018  and 2017  was 414 million  and 54 million  respectively for these noncompete agreements which are being amortized over three years 

other income statement items

for federal income tax purposes the company continues to have the ability to deduct a portion of its drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idcs in the year incurred after the tax cuts and jobs act for periods prior to january 1 2018 idcs were limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt and this has resulted in the company paying amt even when generating or utilizing a net operating loss carryforward nol to offset regular taxable income for periods after january 1 2018 amt has been repealed by the tax cuts and jobs act and the company has the ability to utilize any existing amt credit carryforwards against its current federal tax liability and then receive a refund equal to 50 of the remaining balance in each tax year from 2018 through 2020 with any remaining amt credit carryforward in 2021 being fully refunded  as a result the company will receive a federal tax refund for the 2018 tax year of 128 million  and has 295 million of amt credit carryforward remaining 

net of valuation allowances for sequestration of 13 million as of december 31 2018 as a result of an announcement by the irs in january 2019 reversing its position that amt refunds were subject to sequestration by the federal government at a rate equal to 62 of the refund the company will reverse the related valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2019 

the tax cuts and jobs act limits the utilization of nols generated after december 31 2017 that are carried into future years to 80 of taxable income and limits the deductibility of interest expense as a result of the interest limitation the company recorded a valuation allowance in 2018 for a portion of the interest expense limit imposed for separate company state income tax purposes 

see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s income tax benefit expense including a reconciliation between income tax benefit expense calculated at the current federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate reflected in the companys financial statements for each of the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 13386 million  for 2018  as compared to 2017  the increase was primarily driven by higher operating revenues partly offset by increased cash operating expenses for which contributing factors are discussed in the consolidated results of operations section herein the timing of payments between the two periods and cash settlements paid on derivatives not designated as hedges 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 5734 million  for 2017  as compared to 2016  the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher operating income for which contributing factors are discussed in the consolidated results of operations section herein and the timing of payments between the two periods partly offset by lower cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges 

the companys cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities the company is unable to predict these future price movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing refer to item 1a risk factors  natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position  for further information 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 2230 million  for 2018  as compared to 2017  the decrease was primarily due to investment in the rice merger in 2017  a decrease in capital expenditures for other property acquisitions and proceeds from the 2018 divestitures partly offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily for reserve development and midstream infrastructure attributable to discontinued operations higher capital contributions to mountain valley pipeline llc the mvp joint venture and cash received from the sale of trading securities in 2017  

net cash used in investing activities increased 13156 million  for 2017  as compared to 2016  the increase was primarily due to investment in the rice merger an increase in capital expenditures primarily for reserve development and higher capital contributions to the mvp joint venture partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for other property acquisitions cash received from the sale of trading securities and lower capital expenditures on midstream infrastructure attributable to discontinued operations see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the rice merger   

capital expenditures 



  

 

the company spud 153  gross wells in 2018  including 117  horizontal marcellus wells 5  horizontal upper devonian wells and 31  horizontal utica wells the company spud 201 gross wells in 2017 including 144 horizontal marcellus wells 49 horizontal upper devonian wells seven horizontal utica wells and one other well the company spud 135 gross wells in 2016 including 117 horizontal marcellus wells 13 horizontal upper devonian wells and four horizontal utica wells the increase in capital expenditures for well development in 2018  was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years service cost increases and inefficiencies resulting from higher activity levels and the learning curve on ultralong laterals partly offset by a decrease in property acquisitions the increase in capital expenditures for well development in 2017 was driven primarily by the timing of drilling and completions activities between years and an increase in wells spud partly offset by a decrease in property acquisitions these acquisitions are discussed in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

capital expenditures for the midstream infrastructure are primarily related to expansion capital expenditures which are expenditures incurred for capital improvements that eqm expects to increase its operating income or operating capacity over the long term the increase in expansion capital expenditures in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily related to new gathering and transmission expansion projects in 2018 including the the hammerhead project the equitrans lp expansion project and various 

wellhead gathering expansion projects the decrease in expansion capital expenditures in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily related to the ohio valley connector which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016 

financing activities 

cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 8590 million  for 2018  as compared to 15331 million  for 2017  during 2018  the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from an eqm senior notes offering and the primary uses of financing cash flows were repurchases and retirements of common stock distributions to noncontrolling interests net repayments of credit facility borrowings eqms acquisition of a 25 ownership interest in strike force midstream llc net cash transferred as part of the separation and distribution dividends paid and cash paid for taxes on sharebased incentive awards during 2017  the primary sources of financing cash flows were net proceeds from the 2017 notes offering defined in note 10  to the consolidated financial statements and net borrowings on credit facilities the primary uses of financing cash flows during 2017  were redemptions and repayment of rices debt in connection with the closing of the rice merger redemption of the companys senior notes and distributions to noncontrolling interests

the company may from time to time seek to repurchase its outstanding debt securities such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions the companys liquidity requirements contractual and legal restrictions and other factors 

revolving credit facility 

  

the company primarily utilizes borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs timing differences between capital expenditures and other cash uses and cash flows from operating activities and required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices the companys credit ratings and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys credit facility 

security ratings   and   financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the company at december 31 2018  changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm debt through interest rates and fees under its lines of credit these ratings may also affect collateral requirements under derivative instruments pipeline capacity contracts and rates available on new longterm debt and access to the credit markets 



the company’s credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if any credit rating agency downgrades the ratings particularly below investment grade the company’s access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits on the company’s derivative contracts would increase counterparties may request additional assurances including collateral and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease the required margin on the company’s derivative instruments is also subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the company investment grade refers to the quality of a companys credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies in order to be considered investment grade a company must be rated bbb or higher by sp baa3 or higher by moodys and bbb or higher by fitch anything below these ratings is considered noninvestment grade 

  

the company’s debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that if not complied with could result in termination of the agreements require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions the most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debttototal capitalization ratio limitations on transactions with affiliates insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s credit facility contains financial covenants that require a total debttototal capitalization ratio no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income oci as of december 31 2018  the company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants 

commodity risk management 

the substantial majority of the company’s commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the company’s produced natural gas the company’s overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily swaps calls and puts 

as of january 31 2019 the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s nymex hedge positions through 2023 are 



  

 b the difference between the fixed price and nymex are included in average differential on the company’s price reconciliation under consolidated results of operations the fixed price natural gas sales agreements can be physically or financially settled 

  

for 2019 2020 2021 2022 and 2023 the company has natural gas sales agreements for approximately 33 mmdth 13 mmdth 18mmdth 18mmdth and 18mmdth respectively that include average nymex ceiling prices of 337 368 317 317 and 317 respectively currently the company has also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis and a limited number of contracts to hedge its ngls exposure the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy

schedule of contractual obligations 

the table below presents the company’s longterm contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  in total and by periods 



  

 

as discussed in note 9  to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2018  of 3153 million  of which 882 million  is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the general business tax credit carryforwards the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

commitments and contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s commitments and contingencies 

recently issued accounting standards 

the companys recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a fieldbyfield basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the companys management for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the intended use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted accordingly for basis differentials future operating costs and inflation some of which are interdependent proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches if drilling activity has not commenced if it is determined that the company does not intend to drill on the property prior to expiration or does not have the intent and ability to extend renew trade or sell the lease prior to expiration an impairment expense is recorded 

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls future production costs estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of those recoveries see impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill above and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices operating costs economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the companys financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas ngls and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the 12month period which is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using future 

statutory tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill above for additional information regarding the company’s oil and gas reserves 

  

income taxes  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an amt credit carryforward other federal tax credit carryforwards unrealized capacity contract loss incentive compensation and investment in securities the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the federal and state nol carryforwards and amt credit carryforward as it is believed that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not all be realized as a result of an announcement by the irs in january 2019 reversing its prior position that amt refunds were subject to sequestration by the government at a rate equal to 62 of the refund the company will reverse the related valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2019 in addition a valuation allowance was recorded for a portion of the interest limitation disallowance imposed with the tax cuts and jobs act due to separate company reporting requirements no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 9  to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

derivative instruments the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production 

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use marketbased parameters as inputs including forward curves discount rates volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a riskfree instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or market conditions or other factors change many of which are beyond the company’s control 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices both nymex and basis future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are spud 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation  the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock timebased restricted units and stock options awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant 

  

restricted units and performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards for liability awards the company is required to estimate on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through and value of the company’s common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s common stock adjusted for any expected changes and where applicable of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period historically three years for director phantom units which vest on the date of grant expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company’s financial statements in the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based upon the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically three years the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock 

future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s sharebased compensation 

business combinations  accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value 

the most significant assumptions in a business combination include those used to estimate the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired the fair value of proved natural gas properties is determined using a riskadjusted aftertax discounted cash flow analysis based upon significant assumptions including commodity prices projections of estimated quantities of reserves projections of future rates of production timing and amount of future development and operating costs projected reserve recovery factors and a weighted average cost of capital 

the company utilizes the guideline transaction method to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination which requires the company to use judgment in considering the value per undeveloped acre in recent comparable transactions to estimate the value of unproved properties 

the estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment generally consisting of pipeline systems and compression stations is estimated using the cost approach which incorporates assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets the relative age of assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence 

the fair values of the intangible assets are estimated using the multiperiod excess earnings model which estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the intangible asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets otherwise recognized 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to business combinations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must in determining the fair value of assets acquired make assumptions about future commodity prices projections of estimated quantities of reserves projections of future rates of production projections regarding the timing and amount of future development and operating costs and projections of reserve recovery factors per acre values of undeveloped property replacement cost of and future cash flows from midstream assets cash flow from customer relationships and noncompete agreements and the pre and post modification value of stock based awards different assumptions may result in materially different values for these assets which would impact the company’s financial position and future results of operations 

goodwill the company believes that the accounting estimates related to goodwill are “critical accounting estimates” because the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management’s estimates of future financial results the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management’s estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate however different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the calculated fair value and the resulting determinations about goodwill impairment which could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial position additionally future estimates may differ materially from current estimates and assumptions see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s goodwill 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk and derivative instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas and ngls at the companys ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas and ngls prices could adversely affect among other things the company’s development plans which would decrease the pace of development and the level of the company’s proved reserves 

the company uses derivatives to reduce the effect of commodity price volatility the companys use of derivatives is further described in notes 1  and 5  to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in the capital resources and liquidity section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the companys otc derivative commodity instruments are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of these institutions is regularly monitored the company primarily enters into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and exposure to 

fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s hedge and financial risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of the company’s board of directors 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted sales of production most of which are hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk the company has an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price swap agreements collar agreements and option agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect a portion of cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

for information on the quantity of derivative commodity instruments held by the company see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements and the “commodity risk management” section in the “capital resources and liquidity” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2018  and 2017  levels would have increased the fair value of these natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 4325 million  and 3862 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2018  and 2017  levels would have decreased the fair value of these natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 4434 million  and 3849 million respectively the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  the price change was then applied to these natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the hypothetical change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted produced gas approximates a portion of the company’s expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on the company’s physical sales of natural gas assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term and the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company earns on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rate the company pays on borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the companys floating rate notes all of the company’s senior notes other than the floating rate notes are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s borrowings as applicable and note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company’s otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those 

companies individually as well as the financial industry as a whole the company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures these include closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 64  or 3695 million  of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2018  had a positive fair value approximately 63 or 2420 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2017  had a positive fair value 

  

as of december 31 2018  the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to its derivative contracts the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas ngls and oil a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable are generated from the sale of produced natural gas and ngls to certain marketers utility and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets available through the companys current transportation portfolio which includes markets in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states as well as canada the company also contracts with certain processors to market a portion of ngls on behalf of the company 

  

no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for the eqt credit facility holds more than 10 of the respective facility the large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit the company’s exposure to disruption or consolidation in the banking industry

business segments 

prior to the rice merger the company reported its results of operations through three  business segments eqt production eqt gathering and eqt transmission these reporting segments reflected the companys lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the company evaluated its operating performance through september 30 2017 following the rice merger the company adjusted its internal reporting structure to incorporate the newly acquired assets the company now conducts its business through five  business segments eqt production eqm gathering formerly known as eqt gathering eqm transmission formerly known as eqt transmission rmp gathering and rmp water the eqt production segment incorporates the company’s production activities including those acquired in the rice merger the companys marketing operations and certain gathering operations primarily supporting the companys production activities including the rice retained gathering assets the eqm gathering segment and the eqm transmission segment include all of the companys assets and operations that are owned by eqm therefore the financial and operational disclosures related to eqm gathering and eqm transmission in this annual report on form 10k are the same as eqm’s disclosures in its annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 the rmp gathering segment contains the companys gathering assets that are owned by rmp the rmp water segment contains the companys water pipelines impoundment facilities pumping stations take point facilities and measurement facilities owned by rmp following the rice merger the financial and operational disclosures related to rmp gathering and rmp water will be the same as rmp’s successor disclosures in its annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 

the following illustration depicts eqt’s consolidated acreage position along with its gathering and transmission systems 

eqt production business segment 

  

eqt production holds 214  tcfe of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves across approximately 40 million  gross acres including approximately 11 million  gross acres in the marcellus play many of which also include associated deep utica or upper devonian drilling rights and approximately 01 million  gross acres in the ohio utica as of december 31 2017  eqt believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completions in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology eqt production’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves eqt’s proved reserves increased 59  in 2017  primarily as a result of acquisitions the company’s marcellus assets constituted approximately 169  tcfe of the companys total proved reserves as of december 31 2017  

as of december 31 2017  the company’s proved reserves were as follows 



  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2018 production guidance the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by 2018 produced volumes guidance is 14  years 

the company invested approximately 1385 million  on well development during 2017  with total production sales volumes of 8875  bcfe an increase of 17  over the previous year eqt production expects to spend approximately 22 billion  for well development primarily drilling and completion in 2018  which is expected to support the drilling of approximately 195  gross wells including 134  marcellus wells 16  upper devonian wells and 45  ohio utica wells the company also intends to spend approximately 02 billion  for acreage fillins bolton leasing and other items during the past three years the company’s number of wells drilled spud and related capital expenditures for well development were

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by profitably and safely developing its undeveloped reserves while maintaining an industry leading cost structure and effectively and efficiently utilizing eqms and rmps extensive midstream assets that are uniquely positioned across the marcellus upper devonian and utica shales 

following the rice merger the company has significant acreage scale in the core of the marcellus which will allow eqt to drill considerably longer laterals realize operational efficiencies and improve overall returns eqt believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completion in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology development of multiwell pads in conjunction with longer laterals well spacing and completion techniques allows eqt to maximize recoveries per acre while reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the company’s drilling operations 

  

the companys midstream assets span a wide area of the marcellus upper devonian and utica shales in southwestern pennsylvania northern west virginia and southeastern ohio this footprint provides a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the company for continued growth eqm and rmp intend to capitalize on the growing need for gathering transmission and water infrastructure in this region including the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio 

the company’s board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options for addressing the company’s sumoftheparts discount the board will announce a decision by the end of march 2018 after considering the committee’s recommendation 

see “capital resources and liquidity” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding the company’s capital expenditures 

  

markets and customers 

no  single customer accounted for more than 10 of eqts total operating revenues for 2017  and 2016 one  customer within the eqt production segment accounted for approximately 10  of eqts total operating revenues in 2015  the company believes that the loss of this customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the companys natural gas are available 

  

natural gas sales  the company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in the markets available through the companys current transportation portfolio which includes markets in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company typically receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin is lower relative to the price at henry hub 

louisiana the location for pricing nymex natural gas futures as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the appalachian basin in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production most of which is hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth under the heading “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1  and 7  to the consolidated financial statements 

ngls sales   the company sells ngls from its own gas production and from gas marketed for third parties in its appalachian operations the company primarily contracts with markwest energy partners lp markwest to process natural gas in order to extract the heavier hydrocarbon stream consisting predominately of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline primarily from eqt production’s produced gas the company also contracts with markwest to market a portion of the companys ngls the company also has contractual processing arrangements with williams ohio valley midstream llc to market ngls on behalf of the company in its appalachian operations in its permian basin operations the company sells gas to third party processors at a weighted average liquids component price 

the following table presents the average sales price on a per mcfe basis to eqt corporation for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without cash settled derivatives for the years ended december 31 



  

in addition price information for all products is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “consolidated operational data” and incorporated herein by reference 

  

eqm gathering eqt production accounted for approximately 89  and 84  of eqm gatherings gathering revenues and volumes respectively for 2017 

eqm provides gathering services in two manners firm service and interruptible service the fixed monthly fee under a firm contract is referred to as a firm reservation fee which is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the contracted volume regardless of the amount of natural gas that is gathered if there is available system capacity customers can flow gas above the firm commitment volumes for a usage charge per unit at a rate that is generally the same or lower than the firm capacity charge per unit eqm has firm gas gathering agreements in high pressure development areas with approximately 23 bcf per day of total firm contracted gathering capacity as of december 31 2017 including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which eqm had entered into firm gathering agreements approximately 24 bcf per day of firm gathering capacity was subscribed under firm gathering contracts as of december 31 2017 on eqms low pressure regulated gathering system the typical gathering agreement is interruptible and has a one year term with monthtomonth roll over provisions terminable upon at least 30 days notice the rates for gathering service on the regulated system are based on the maximum posted tariff rate and assessed on actual receipts into the gathering system eqm generally does not take title to the natural gas gathered for its customers but retains a percentage of wellhead natural gas receipts to recover natural gas used to run its compressor stations and other requirements on all of its gathering systems 

  

eqm transmission in 2017  eqt production accounted for approximately 64  of transmission volumes and 53  of transmission revenues for eqm transmission other customers include local distribution companies marketers other independent producers and commercial and industrial users eqms transmission system provides these customers with access to adjacent markets in pennsylvania west virginia and ohio and also provides access to the midatlantic northeastern midwestern and gulf coast markets in the united states through interconnect capacity with major interstate pipelines 

eqm transmission generally does not take title to the natural gas transported or stored for its customers eqm transmission provides services in two manners firm service and interruptible service the fixed monthly fee under a firm contract is referred to as a capacity reservation fee which is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the contracted volume regardless of the amount of natural gas that is transported or stored in addition to capacity reservation fees eqm transmission may also collect usage fees when a firm transmission customer uses the capacity it has reserved under these firm transmission contracts where applicable the usage fees are assessed on the actual volume of natural gas transported on the system a firm customer is billed an additional usage fee on volumes in excess of firm capacity when the level of natural gas received for delivery from the customer exceeds its reserved capacity customers are not assured capacity or service for volumes in excess of firm capacity on the applicable pipeline as these volumes have the same priority as interruptible service 

under interruptible service contracts customers pay usage fees based on their actual utilization of assets customers that have executed interruptible contracts are not assured capacity or service on the applicable systems to the extent that physical capacity that is contracted for firm service is not fully utilized or excess capacity that has not been contracted for service exists the system can allocate such capacity to interruptible services 

including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which eqm has entered into firm contracts approximately 51 bcf per day of transmission capacity and 313 bcf of storage capacity respectively were subscribed under firm transmission and storage contracts as of december 31 2017 eqm transmissions firm transmission and storage contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 15 years as of december 31 2017 based on total projected contracted revenues 

as of december 31 2017 approximately 89 of eqm transmissions contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff approximately 9 of eqm transmission’s contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed at the recourse rates under its tariff which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff the remaining 2 of eqm transmission’s contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed at discounted rates which are less than the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff 

eqm transmission has an acreage dedication from eqt pursuant to which eqm transmission has the right to elect to transport on its transmission and storage system all natural gas produced from wells drilled by eqt under an area covering approximately 60000 acres in allegheny washington and greene counties in pennsylvania and wetzel marion taylor tyler doddridge harrison and lewis counties in west virginia eqt has a significant natural gas drilling program in these areas 

  

natural gas marketing   eqt energy llc eqt energy and rice energy marketing llc eqts indirect wholly owned marketing subsidiaries provide marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of eqt production and third parties the marketing subsidiaries also engage in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of eqt production the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices 

rmp gathering  during the year ended december 31 2017 eqt and rice prior to the rice merger represented substantially all of rmp gathering’s gathering and compression revenues 

rmp gathering has secured dedications from certain eqt affiliates under various fixed price per unit gathering and compression agreements covering i approximately 246000 gross acres of eqts acreage position in washington and greene counties pennsylvania and ii subject to certain exceptions and limitations pursuant to the gas gathering and compression agreements any future acreage certain affiliates of eqt acquire within these counties 

rmp water services  during the year ended december 31 2017 eqt and rice prior to the rice merger represented approximately 96  of rmp waters water service revenues 

rmp water has the exclusive right to provide certain fluid handling services to eqt production until december 22 2029 and from month to month thereafter the fluid handling services include the exclusive right to provide fresh water for well completions operations and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water within areas of dedication in washington and greene counties pennsylvania and belmont county ohio rmp water also provides water services to third parties under feebased contracts to support well completion activities 

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production transportation and sale of natural gas and ngls and the securing of services labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators within and outside of the appalachian basin 

competition for natural gas gathering transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates customer commitment levels timing performance commercial terms reliability service levels location reputation and fuel efficiencies key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines key competitors for gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies eqt competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and ngls some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers 

key competitors for water services include natural gas producers that develop their own water distribution systems in lieu of employing the companys assets and other natural gas midstream companies our ability to attract volumes to the water services business depends on the companys ability to evaluate and select suitable projects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing eqt production’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties kentucky ohio virginia and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia the company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus and upper devonian acreage in 2013 the pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases and texas permits similar joint development in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and texas sets allowables on the amount of production permitted from a well 

  

the companys gathering and transmission operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations and transmission facilities these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

  

the companys interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the ferc and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the ferc the ferc approves tariffs that establish eqm’s rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service applicable to its fercregulated assets the fees or rates established under eqm’s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority over transmission operations also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

in 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other cftc rules that may be relevant to the company have yet to be finalized because significant cftc rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company has experienced increased and anticipates additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

  

regulators periodically review or audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the us congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the company 

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing operating and abandoning wells pipelines and related facilities the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations the company conducts baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of the companys drilling pads legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells 

see note 20  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of expenditures related to environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation the epa and various states have issued a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 

  

employees 

  

the company and its subsidiaries had 2067 employees at the end of 2017  none are subject to a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position depend upon the prices for natural gas ngls and oil the prices for natural gas ngls and oil have historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions and seasonal trends the supply of and demand for natural gas ngls and oil regional basis differentials national and worldwide economic and political conditions new and competing exploratory finds of natural gas ngls and oil the ability to export liquefied natural gas the effect of energy conservation efforts the price and availability of alternative fuels the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 377  per mmbtu to a low of 149  per mmbtu from january 1 2016 through december 31 2017 and the daily spot prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 6046  per barrel to a low of 2619  per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian and other market point basis ngls and oil and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations 

lower prices for natural gas ngls and oil result in lower revenues operating income and cash flows prolonged low andor significant or extended further declines in natural gas ngls and oil prices may result in further decreases in our revenues operating income and cash flows which may result in reductions in drilling activity delays in the construction of new midstream infrastructure and downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit ratings further declines in prices could also adversely affect the amount of natural gas ngls and oil that we can produce economically which may result in us having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur noncash impairment charges to earnings in future periods see “impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including goodwill and other long lived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods” under item 1a “risk factors” moreover a failure to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngls and oil prices could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value further adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our hedge counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection 

increases in natural gas ngls and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral provided to our hedge counterparties which is interestbearing is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas   

we may not achieve the intended benefits of the acquisition of rice and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate rice’s assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of rice in addition our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations going forward the integration has required and will continue to require significant time and focus from management and could disrupt current plans and operations which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives 

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the operations for drilling completions producing transporting and storing natural gas ngls and oil such as well site blowouts cratering and explosions pipe and other equipment and system failures landslides fires formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures freeze offs of wells and pipelines due to cold weather inadvertent third party damage to the companys assets pollution and environmental risks and natural disasters we also face various threats to the security of our or third parties’ facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants compressor stations and pipelines these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment pollution or other environmental damage disruptions to our operations regulatory investigations and penalties and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

our failure to develop obtain access or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas ngls and oil to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of natural gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities the capacity of transmission gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil competition for access to pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense and our ability to secure access to pipeline infrastructure on economic terms could affect our competitive position the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure through eqm and rmp is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transmission pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns operational efficiency and construction and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and a qualified work force as well as the complexity of construction locations weather conditions delays in obtaining permits and other government approvals title and property access problems geology public opposition to infrastructure development compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors moreover if our infrastructure development and maintenance programs are not successfully developed on time and within budget we may not be able to profitably fulfill our contractual obligations to third parties including joint venture partners 

we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty natural gas ngls and oil transmission gathering processing and storage facilities that are limited in number geographically concentrated and subject to the same risks identified above with respect to our infrastructure development and maintenance programs because we do not own these thirdparty pipelines or facilities their continuing operation is not within our control an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including vandalism sabotage or cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil in such an event we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor sell our production at prices lower than we currently project in addition some of our thirdparty contracts involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part moreover our usage of third parties for transmission gathering and processing services subjects us to the performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market 

the substantial majority of our producing properties are concentrated in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area   

the substantial majority of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the appalachian basin as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by and costs associated with governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations water shortages or other weather related conditions interruption of the processing or transportation of oil natural gas or ngls and changes in regional and local political regimes and regulations such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition a number of areas within the appalachian basin have historically been subject to mining operations for example third parties may engage in subsurface mining operations near or under our properties which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties adversely impact our drilling operations or adversely impact our midstream activities or those on which we rely 

due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2018 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development reserve acquisitions exploratory activities midstream infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital    notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2018 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify and execute optimal business strategies including the appropriate corporate structure and appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2018 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

in addition we announced in late 2017 that our board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options to address our sumoftheparts discount with the results of such review to be announced by the end of march 2018 there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of this review or how such outcome may affect us 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering and transmission systems and pipelines our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of water and other fluids and materials including solid wastes incidental to oil and gas 

operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas resources 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties some states allow the statutory pooling and unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration as well as joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air ground and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling and pipeline construction environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety including replacement requirements and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business or result in delays due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed governmental approvals and permits these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transmission and storage businesses are in many cases subject to federal regulation by the ferc which may prohibit us from realizing a level of return that we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of lower overall rates imputed revenue credits cost disallowances andor expense deferrals for example under current policy the ferc permits interstate pipelines to include an income tax allowance in the costofservice used as the basis for calculating their regulated rates for pipelines owned by partnerships including eqm the tax allowance reflects the actual or potential income tax liability on the fercjurisdictional income attributable to all partnership interests if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income if the ferc’s income tax allowance policy which is subject to legal challenges were to change and if the ferc were to disallow all or a substantial portion of the current income tax allowance for eqm’s pipelines including adjusting the income tax allowance for reduced income tax rates enacted by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 eqm’s regulated rates and therefore its revenues could be materially adversely affected which eventually could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 

certain natural gas gathering facilities are exempted from regulation by the ferc we believe that many of our natural gas facilities meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company although the ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to the jurisdictional status of those facilities however the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation within the industry so the classification and regulation of some of our facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or the us congress 

failure to comply with applicable provisions of the laws governing the regulation and safety of natural gas gathering transmission and storage facilities as well as with the regulations rules orders restrictions and conditions associated with these laws could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties for example the ferc is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately 12 million per violation per day for violations of the natural gas act of 1938 the natural gas policy act of 1978 or the rules regulations restrictions conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes the violation of federal pipeline safety laws could lead to the imposition of civil penalties of up to approximately 200000 per day for each violation up to a maximum penalty of approximately 2 million for a related series of violations this maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming in addition to periodic changes to air water and waste laws as well as recent epa initiatives to impose climate changebased air regulations on the industry the us congress and various states have been evaluating and in certain cases have enacted climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

another area of regulation is hydraulic fracturing which we utilize to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation or regulation has been proposed or is under discussion at federal state and local levels for instance legislation or regulation banning hydraulic fracturing has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions in which we do not have drilling operations we cannot predict whether any other such federal state or local legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how it may affect our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs result in delays in production or delivery of natural gas or perhaps even preclude us from drilling wells 

subsequent to the broad tax reform changes provided in the law known as the tax cuts and job act of 2017 other tax law changes could be enacted that have a material impact on us the most significant potential tax law change would be a full or partial elimination of the ability to expense intangible drilling costs or a linking of that deduction to the deduction for interest expense either of which could adversely impact both current and deferred federal and state income tax liabilities the cash cost of any such change could impact our ability to develop our natural gas resources 

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production often fluctuate and could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business could change such as the change resulting from the law known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 any such increase or change or varying interpretations of these laws including the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

in 2010 the us congress adopted the doddfrank act which established federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including us such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other rules that may be relevant to us or our counterparties have yet to be finalized because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on our hedging program including available counterparties or regulatory compliance obligations we have experienced increased and anticipate additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 

  

we eqm and rmp rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including access to capital markets and changes in the terms of and cost of capital including increases in interest rates may adversely affect our eqms or rmps business and financial condition our eqms and rmps ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we eqm or rmp desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our eqms or rmps flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions or our ability to implement our business strategies 

  

as of february 15 2018 our senior notes were rated “baa3” by moody’s investors services moody’s “bbb” by standard  poor’s ratings service sp with a negative outlook and “bbb” by fitch ratings service fitch and eqms senior notes were rated “ba1” by moodys “bbb” by sp and “bbb” by fitch although we are not aware of any current plans of moody’s sp or fitch to lower their respective ratings on our or eqm’s senior notes we cannot be assured that our or eqm’s credit ratings will not be downgraded or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency low prices for natural gas ngls and oil or an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our or eqm’s senior notes if any credit rating agency downgrades the ratings particularly below investment grade our or eqm’s access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits on our derivatives would increase we may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of pipeline capacity contracts the amount of which may be substantial or we or eqm may be required to provide additional credit assurances related to joint venture arrangements or construction contracts which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity investment grade refers to the quality of a company’s credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies in order to be considered investment grade a company must be rated “bbb” or higher by sp “baa3” or higher by moody’s and “bbb” or higher by fitch 

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on 

us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to identify attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with identifying attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot identify attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things oil spills the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing and pipeline projects may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

cyber incidents may adversely impact our operations 

  

our business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications to operate our production and midstream businesses and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our systems or infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas ngls and oil difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents 

our failure to assess or capitalize on production opportunities could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a well is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the natural gas ngls and oil to market moreover an incorrect determination of legal title to our wells could result in liability to the owner of the natural gas or oil rights and an impairment to our assets successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect for example seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas or other hydrocarbons certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful this failure could adversely affect our business results of operations or liquidity because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets including goodwill and other long lived intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties midstream assets and goodwill for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in addition we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events the estimated future cash flows used to test our proved oil and gas properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the company’s management for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil future operating costs and inflation commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the fiveyear 

nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality basis and inflation proved oil and gas properties and midstream assets that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

our estimate of the fair value of our assets depends on the prices of natural gas ngls and oil primarily as a result of declines in nymex forward strip prices we recorded noncash pretax impairment charges of 597 million  to certain longlived assets during 2016 and 943 million  to our proved oil and gas properties in the noncore permian basin during 2015 future declines in natural gas ngls or oil prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance among other things may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves andor could result in additional noncash impairment charges to writedown the carrying amount of our assets including goodwill and other long lived intangible assets which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods for example all other things being equal a further decline in the average fiveyear nymex forward strip price in a future period may cause the company to recognize impairments on noncore assets including the companys assets in the huron play which had a carrying value of approximately 3 billion  at december 31 2017 any impairment of our assets including goodwill and other long lived intangible assets would require us to take an immediate charge to earnings such charges could be material to our results of operations and could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations see “impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the amount and timing of actual future natural gas ngls and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngls and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas ngls and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

we also rely on third parties for certain construction drilling and completion services materials and supplies delays or failures to perform by such third parties could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and oil reserves 

  

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil the amount timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngls and oil industry in general 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs some of which are beyond our control these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows numerous changes over time 

to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

consolidated results of operations 

  

2017  eqt highlights 

 

net income attributable to eqt corporation for 2017  was 15085 million  804  per diluted share compared with a loss attributable to eqt corporation of 4530 million  a loss of 271  per diluted share in 2016  the 19615 million  increase in net income attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit recorded as a result of the lower federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018 the result of a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2017 compared to a loss in 2016 a 23  increase in the average realized price a 17  increase in production sales volumes and higher pipeline water and net marketing services partially offset by higher operating expenses higher interest expense higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a loss on debt extinguishment in 2017 

during the year ended december 31 2017 the company recorded acquisition expenses of approximately 2373 million  related to the rice merger including 1413 million  of employee related expenses for payments to former rice employees under the merger agreement additional expenses were for investment banking legal and other professional fees acquisition costs are reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment 

eqt production received 407 million  and 2794 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues 

net loss attributable to eqt corporation for 2016  was 4530 million  a loss of 271  per diluted share compared with net income attributable to eqt corporation of 852 million  056  per diluted share in 2015  the 5382 million  decrease in income attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges a 20  decrease in the average realized price higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests partially offset by a 26  increase in production sales volumes and lower income tax expense 

eqt production received 2794 million  and 1721 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap 

operating revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2016 the company recorded an impairment of longlived assets of approximately 597 million  related to certain gathering assets sold to eqm in october 2016 the impairment was a result of a reduction in estimated future cash flows caused by the low commodity price environment and the related reduced producer drilling activity and throughput this impairment is reflected in unallocated expenses and not recorded on any operating segment

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

the table below reconciles eqt production adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure to eqt production total operating revenues as reported under eqt production results of operations its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of eqt production operating revenues to eqt corporation total operating revenues as reported in the statements of consolidated operations 

eqt production adjusted operating revenues also referred to as total natural gas  liquids sales including cash settled derivatives is presented because it is an important measure used by the company’s management to evaluate periodoverperiod comparisons of earnings trends eqt production adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services management utilizes eqt production adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement eqt production adjusted operating revenues also excludes pipeline and net marketing services because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production pipeline and net marketing services primarily includes revenues for gathering services provided to third parties as well as both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used for eqt production sales volumes management further believes that eqt production adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating periodoverperiod earnings trends

results of operations 



year ended december 31 2017  vs december 31 2016   

eqt production’s operating income totaled 5897 million  for 2017  compared to operating loss of 7197 million  for 2016  the 13094 million  increase was primarily due to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to losses on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31 2016 higher average realized price and increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and ngls partly offset by increased operating expenses these variances include the impact of the operations of rice for the period subsequent to the rice merger which added approximately 1656 million of operating income for the year ended december 31 2017 including 1146 million in gains on derivatives not designated as hedges 

total operating revenues were 31063 million  for 2017  compared to 13871 million  for 2016  sales of natural gas oil and ngls increased as a result of a higher average realized price and a 17  increase in production sales volumes in 2017 eqt production received 407 million  and 2794 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain loss on derivatives not designated as hedges the increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of recent acquisition activity including the rice merger as well as increased production from the 2015 and 2016 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus play partially offset by the normal production decline in the companys producing wells in 2017 

the 057  per mcfe increase in the average realized price for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily due to the increase in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of 029  per mcf an increase in the average natural gas differential of 019  per mcf and an increase in liquids prices the improvement in the average differential primarily related to more favorable basis partly offset by unfavorable cash settled basis swaps during 2017 basis improved in the appalachian basin and at sales points reached through the company’s transportation portfolio particularly in the united states northeast in addition the company started flowing its produced volumes to its rockies express pipeline capacity and texas eastern transmission gulf markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to basis for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 

pipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the company’s produced volumes the 240 million  increase in these revenues primarily related to increased gathering revenues for services provided to third parties on gathering lines acquired from rice in addition to costs net of recoveries for the company’s rockies express pipeline capacity in 2016 

eqt production total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  included a 3900 million  gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to a 2490 million  loss on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31 2016  the gains for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily related to increases in the fair market value of eqt production’s nymex swaps due to decreased nymex prices partly offset by decreases in the fair market value of its basis swaps due to increased basis prices 

gathering expense increased due to increased affiliate and third party gathering capacity the rice merger increased affiliate gathering expense as a result of volumes gathered by rmp gathering which added approximately 210 million of expense for the postrice merger period in addition eqt production increased firm gathering capacity on the affiliate gathering systems owned by eqm gathering in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017 the company’s 2016 and 2017 acquisitions excluding rice added third party gathering capacity and expense transmission expense increased due to increased third party capacity and increased firm contracts with affiliates incurred to move eqt production’s natural gas out of the appalachian basin during the fourth quarter of 2016 eqms ohio valley connector ovc was placed into service and as a result the company started flowing its produced volumes to its rockies express pipeline capacity additionally the companys firm capacity on rockies express pipeline increased in the first quarter of 2017 firm capacity acquired in connection with the rice merger also increased transmission expenses by approximately 242 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 the company started flowing its produced volumes to its texas eastern transmission gulf markets pipeline capacity processing expense increased 44  as a result of increased processing capacity acquired through recent acquisitions and higher volumes processed which is consistent with higher ethane and ngls sales volumes of approximately 50 during 2017 

the increase in loe was primarily due to higher salt water disposal costs production taxes increased as a result of higher market prices during the year ended december 31 2017 in combination with an increase in the number of wells drilled in pennsylvania and an increase in production volumes from recent acquisitions 

exploration expense increased primarily due to expenses related to an exploratory well in a noncore operating area classified as a dry hole in 2017 

sga expense decreased primarily due to lower pension expense of 94 million related to the termination of the eqt corporation retirement plan for employees in the second quarter of 2016 lower legal reserves in 2017 a reduction to the reserve for uncollectible accounts and the absence of costs related to the consolidation of the company’s huron operations in 2016 this was partly offset by higher costs associated with recent acquisitions

year ended december 31 2016  vs december 31 2015   

  

eqt production’s operating loss totaled 7197 million  for 2016  compared to operating income of 1320 million  for 2015  the 8517 million  decrease in operating income was primarily due to a loss on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2016 compared to gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2015 a lower average realized price increased operating expenses and decreased pipeline and net marketing services partly offset by increased sales volumes of produced natural gas and ngls 

total operating revenues were 13871 million  for 2016  compared to 21317 million  for 2015  sales of natural gas oil and ngls decreased as a result of a lower average realized price partly offset by a 26  increase in production sales volumes in 2016 eqt production received 2794 million and 1721 million of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues the increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus play partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells 

  

the 062  per mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily due to the decrease in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of 053 per mcf and a decrease in the average 

natural gas differential of 012  per mcf the decrease in the average differential primarily related to lower basis partly offset by favorable cash settled basis swaps while appalachian basin basis improved slightly for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 basis in the united states northeast was significantly lower particularly in the 

first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to reduced demand attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions additionally the impact of changes in natural gas prices on physical basis sales contracts and fixed price sales contracts reduced basis year over year the company started flowing eqt production’s produced volumes to its rockies express pipeline capacity and texas eastern transmission gulf markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to basis in 2016 

pipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to third parties and both the cost of and recoveries on third party pipeline capacity not used to transport the company’s produced volumes the decrease in these revenues primarily related to reduced spreads on the company’s tennessee gas pipeline capacity

operating expenses totaled 21148 million  for 2016  compared to 19997 million  for 2015  the increase in operating 

expenses primarily resulted from increases in dda gathering transmission and processing partly offset by reductions in noncash impairments of longlived assets and exploration expense gathering expense increased due to increased affiliate firm capacity and volumetric charges and due to increased third party volumetric charges transmission expense increased as a result of higher third party costs incurred to move eqt production’s natural gas out of the appalachian basin and increased affiliate firm capacity charges processing expenses increased due to higher production volumes 

the decrease in loe was primarily due to lower salt water disposal costs as a result of increased recycling in the marcellus shale and certain operational cost savings in the huron operations partly offset by costs related to the consolidation of the company’s huron operations production taxes were essentially flat as a higher pennsylvania impact fee and severance tax settlement were offset by lower unhedged sales prices a favorable property tax settlement and the expiration of the west virginia volume based tax in 2016 the state of west virginia previously imposed a 0047 per mcf additional volume based severance tax that was terminated on july 1 2016 

exploration expense was lower primarily due to a decrease in lease expirations related to acreage that the company does not intend to drill prior to expiration and expenses related to exploratory wells in 2015 sga expense increased due to higher litigation costs a 94 million charge related to the termination of the eqt corporation retirement plan for employees incurred in 2016 an increase to the reserve for uncollectible accounts and nonrecurring costs related to the consolidation of the company’s huron operations and acquisition related expenses in 2016 these increases were partly offset by drilling program reduction charges in the permian and huron basins in 2015 decreased personnel costs decreased professional service costs and charges to write off expired right of ways options in 2015 the increase in depletion expense within dda expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2016 depreciation expense within dda increased as a result of additional assets in service 

impairment of longlived assets decreased 1155 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the 2016 impairment charge primarily consisted of lease impairments on acreage that the company did not intend to drill prior to expiration the 2015 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the permian basin of texas and impairments of proved properties in the utica shale of ohio as well as unproved property impairments and impairment of field level ngls processing equipment that was not being used the proved properties impairments in 2015 were a result of continued declines in commodity prices and insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development the 2016 and 2015 impairments related to the unproved properties resulted from operational decisions to focus nearterm development activities in the companys marcellus upper devonian and utica acreage 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2016 eqt production sold a gathering system that primarily gathered gas for third parties for 750 million in conjunction with this transaction the company realized a pretax gain of 80 million which is included in gain on sale  exchange of assets in the statements of consolidated operations

income taxes 



  

on december 22 2017 the us congress enacted the law known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax reform legislation which made significant changes to us federal income tax law including lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 beginning january 1 2018 as a result of the change in the corporate tax rate the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of 12 billion during the year ended december 31 2017 to revalue its existing net deferred tax liabilities to the lower rate 

for federal income tax purposes the company may deduct a portion of its drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idcs in the year incurred idcs however have historically been limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt and this has resulted in the company paying amt even when generating or utilizing a net operating loss carryforward nol to offset regular taxable income 

the tax reform legislation also repealed the amt for tax years beginning january 1 2018 and provides that existing amt credit carryforwards can be utilized to offset current federal tax liability in tax years 2018 through 2020 in addition 50 of any unused amt credit carryforwards can be refunded during these years with any remaining amt credit carryforward being fully refunded in 2021 the company had approximately 435 million  of amt credit carryforward as of december 31 2017 in addition the tax reform legislation preserved deductibility of idcs and provides for 100 bonus depreciation on some tangible property expenditures through 2022 

the tax reform legislation contains several other provisions such as limiting the utilization of nols generated after december 31 2017 that are carried into future years to 80 of taxable income and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense which are not expected to have a material effect on the companys results of operations as of december 31 2017 the company has not completed its accounting for the effects of the tax reform legislation but has recorded provisional amounts for the revaluing of net deferred tax liabilities as well as the state income tax effects related to the tax reform legislation the company also considered whether existing deferred tax amounts will be recovered in future periods under this legislation however the company is still analyzing certain aspects of the tax reform legislation and refining calculations which could potentially impact the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts the company will refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it comes available through the filing date of its 2017 us income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018 

all of eqgps rmps and strike force midstreams income is included in the companys pretax income loss however the company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portions of eqgps and rmps income allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners of eqgp eqm and rmp or to the minority owner of strike force midstream which reduces the companys effective tax rate in periods when the company has consolidated pretax income and increases the companys effective tax rate in periods when the company has consolidated pretax loss 

for 2017 and 2016 the company generated a federal taxable loss and the company paid amt in 2016 the federal and amt nols generated by the taxable losses for 2017 and 2016 will be carried back to 2015 and 2014 to generate a tax refund from 2015 and an increase in amt credit carryforwards for those years the company paid federal income tax in 2015 as a result of tax gains related to eqgps ipo and the sale of nwv gathering to eqm during that year 

see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s income tax benefit expense including a reconciliation between income tax expense calculated at the current federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate reflected in the companys financial statements for each of the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 



  

the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2017 was the result of higher net income at eqm and noncontrolling interests in rmp and strike force midstream as a result of the rice merger the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily the result of increased net income at eqm increased ownership of eqm common units by third parties and eqgps ipo in 2015 

outlook 

  

the company’s board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options for addressing the company’s sumoftheparts discount the board will announce a decision by the end of march 2018 after considering the committee’s recommendation 

the company is committed to profitably and safely developing its appalachian basin natural gas and ngl reserves through environmentally responsible costeffective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling the company believes the longterm outlook for its business is favorable due to the company’s substantial resource base low cost structure financial strength risk management including its commodity hedging strategy and disciplined investment of capital the company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area 

the company monitors current and expected market conditions including the commodity price environment and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly while the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions the company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for redeployment into the highest value development opportunities upon the closing of the rice merger the company’s consolidation goals were largely met and the company plans to focus on integrating the rice assets and realizing higher returns through longer laterals and achieving an even lower operating cost structure the company will also continue to pursue tactical acquisitions of fillin acreage to extend laterals and has announced its intention to sell the rice retained midstream assets to eqm through one or more dropdown transactions 

eqt production expects to spend approximately 22 billion  for well development primarily drilling and completion in 2018  which is expected to support the drilling of approximately 195  gross wells including 134  marcellus wells 16  upper devonian wells and 45  ohio utica wells the company also intends to spend approximately 02 billion  for acreage fillins bolton leasing and other items estimated sales volumes are expected to be 1520  1560 bcfe for 2018 

the 2018 drilling program is expected to support a 15 increase in production sales volume in 2019 over our 2018 expected sales volumes with total ngls volumes expected to be 12300  12600 mbbls to support continued growth in production the company plans to invest approximately 15 billion  on midstream infrastructure through eqm in 2018 including capital contributions to the mvp joint venture of 11 billion  rmp investments in organic projects are expected to total approximately 260 million  in 2018 including 215 million  for gathering and compression and 45 million  for water infrastructure 

the 2018  capital investment plan for eqt production is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and cash on hand eqms available sources of liquidity include cash on hand and generated from operations borrowings under its credit facilities debt offerings and issuances of additional eqm partnership interests rmps 2018 capital investment plan is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility 

the company’s revenues earnings liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for and the company’s ability to develop its reserves of natural gas and ngls due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian and other market point basis and ngls and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations 

the companys 2018 capital expenditure forecast for well development is 59  higher than its 2017 well development spending changes in natural gas ngls and oil prices could affect among other things the companys development plans which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the companys reserves as well as the companys revenues earnings or liquidity lower prices could also result in noncash impairments in the book value of the company’s oil and gas 

properties goodwill or other long lived intangible assets or downward adjustments to the company’s estimated proved reserves any such impairment andor downward adjustment to the company’s estimated reserves could potentially be material to the company 

impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill 

see “critical accounting policies and estimates” and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company’s accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the company’s oil and gas properties due to declines in the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices during 2015 and into 2016 the company determined that indicators of potential impairment existed for certain of the company’s proved oil and gas properties in those years no indicators of impairment were identified as of december 31 2017 although the company did not have indicators of impairment or record an impairment on its oil and gas producing properties during 2017 all other things being equal a further decline in the average fiveyear nymex forward strip price in a future period may cause the company to recognize impairments on noncore assets including the companys assets in the huron play which had a carrying value of approximately 3 billion  at december 31 2017 

 see “critical accounting policies and estimates” for a discussion of the company’s accounting policies and significant assumptions related to evaluating the company’s goodwill for impairment the company evaluated goodwill for impairment at december 31 2017 and determined there was no indicator of impairment we use a combination of the income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management’s estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the companys stock price weightedaverage cost of capital terminal growth rates and industry multiples although we believe the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate different estimates and assumptions could materially impact the calculated fair value of the reporting units additionally future results could differ from our current estimates and assumptions any potential change in such estimates and assumptions would have an impact on the results of operations and financial position due to the uncertainty inherent in and the interdependence of the assumptions of underlying assets and goodwill impairment determinations the company cannot predict if future impairment charges will be recognized and if so an estimate of the impairment charges that would be recorded in any future period 

see “natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs adverse changes in well performance or impairment of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods” under item 1a “risk factors” 

capital resources and liquidity 

  

the company’s primary sources of cash for the year ended december 31 2017 were proceeds from the 2017 notes offering defined in note 15  to the consolidated financial statements borrowings on credit facilities and cash flows from operating activities while the primary uses of cash were for redemptions and repayments of rices senior notes and credit facilities in connection with the closing of the rice merger capital expenditures the cash portion of the merger consideration for the rice merger and redemptions of company senior notes 

operating activities 

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities increased 5734 million  from full year 2016  to full year 2017 the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher operating income for which contributing factors are discussed in the consolidated results of operations and business segment results of operations sections herein and the timing of payments between the two periods partly offset by lower cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges 

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 1526 million  from full year 2015  to full year 2016  the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a lower commodity price and higher operating expenses partly offset by higher production sales volumes cash settlements on derivatives not designated as hedges decreases in cash paid for income taxes and the timing of payments between periods 

the companys cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities the company is unable to predict these future price movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing refer to natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position under item 1a risk factors for further information 

investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 41271 million  for 2017 as compared to 29615 million  for 2016 the 11656 million  increase was primarily due to investment in the rice merger an increase in capital expenditures for drilling and completions spending and higher capital contributions to the mvp joint venture partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for other property acquisitions cash received from the sale of trading securities and lower eqm capital expenditures 

on november 13 2017 in conjunction with the rice merger each share of the common stock par value 001  per share of rice the rice common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive 037  the exchange ratio of a share of the common stock no par value of the company company common stock and 530  in cash collectively the merger consideration the aggregate merger consideration consisted of approximately 91 million  shares of company common stock and approximately 16 billion  in cash net of cash acquired and inclusive of amounts payable to employees of rice who did not continue with the company following the effective time see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the rice merger 

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 29615 million  for 2016 as compared to 25256 million  for 2015 the 4359 million  increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for acquisitions of 10512 million and investments in trading securities of 2888 million partly offset by a reduction in the drilling and completions capital expenditures during 2016 the company invested in trading securities which consist of liquid debt securities carried at fair value to maximize returns the company also placed 750 million of the proceeds received from the sale of a gathering system into restricted cash for a potential likekind exchange for tax purposes

commodity risk management 

the substantial majority of the company’s commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the company’s produced natural gas the company’s overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily nymex swaps collars and options 

as of january 31 2018 the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2018 through 2020 were 



  

a full year 2018 

 c for 2018 the company also sold puts for approximately 3 bcf at a strike price of 263 per mcf 

   

the company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery the difference between these sales prices and nymex are included in average differential on the companys price reconciliation under consolidated operational data the company has fixed price physical sales for 2018 and 2019 of 121 bcf and 37 bcf respectively at average nymex prices of 293 per mcf and 304 per mcf respectively for 2018 the company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 35 bcf per year that includes a nymex ceiling price of 488 per mcf for 2018 2019 and 2020 the company has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 49 bcf per year that includes a nymex ceiling price of 336 per mcf for 2018 2019 and 2020 the company also has a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 7 bcf per year that includes a nymex floor price of 216 per mcf and a nymex ceiling price of 447 per mcf currently the company has also entered into derivative instruments to hedge basis and a limited number of contracts to hedge its ngls exposure the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005 the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco the savings guarantees provided that once the energyefficiency construction was completed by noresco the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately 95 million  as of december 31 2017 extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 11 years  

as of december 31 2017  eqm had issued a 91 million  performance guarantee in favor of the mvp joint venture to provide performance assurances for mvp holdcos obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the mvp 

the noresco guarantees and the mvp guarantee are exempt from asc topic 460 guarantees  the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

rate regulation 

  

as described under “regulation” in item 1 “business” the company’s transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation as described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs see “our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings” in item 1a “risk factors” for potential risks related to the regulation of rates by the ferc 

schedule of contractual obligations 

the table below presents the company’s longterm contractual obligations as of december 31 2017 in total and by periods purchase obligations exclude the company’s contractual obligations relating to its binding precedent agreements and other natural gas transmission and gathering capacity agreements with eqm for which future payments related to such agreements totaled 56 billion  as of december 31 2017 these capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years purchase obligations also exclude future capital contributions to the mvp joint venture and purchase obligations of the mvp joint venture 



  

 e see note 20  for additional information 

 

as discussed in note 11  to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017 of 3016 million  of which 841 million  is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

commitments and contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity

recently issued accounting standards 

the companys recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a fieldbyfield basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the companys management for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the intended use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted accordingly for basis differentials future operating costs and inflation some of which are interdependent proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes in development plans resulting from economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves prior to their expirations the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made 

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls future production costs estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of those recoveries see impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill above and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices operating costs economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the companys financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas ngls and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the 12month period which is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using future statutory tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see impairment of oil and gas properties and goodwill above for additional information regarding the company’s oil and gas reserves 

  

income taxes  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward other federal tax credit carryforwards incentive compensation and investment in partnerships the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the federal and state nol carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforward as it is believed that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 11  to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

derivative instruments the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use marketbased parameters as inputs including forward curves discount rates volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a riskfree instrument and 

credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or market conditions or other factors change many of which are beyond the company’s control 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices both nymex and basis future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are spud the company operates and maintains its gathering systems and transmission and storage system and it intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future the company is under no legal or contractual obligation to restore or dismantle its gathering systems and transmission and storage system upon abandonment therefore the company does not have any asset retirement obligations related to its gathering systems and transmission and storage system as of december 31 2017 and 2016 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation  the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock timebased restricted units and stock options awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant 

  

restricted units and performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards for liability awards the company is required to estimate on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through and value of the company’s common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s common stock adjusted for any expected changes and where applicable of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period historically three years for director phantom units which vest on the date of grant expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company’s financial statements in the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based upon the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically three years the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see note 18  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s sharebased compensation 

business combinations  accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at fair value 

the most significant assumptions in a business combination include those used to estimate the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired the fair value of proved natural gas properties is determined using a riskadjusted aftertax discounted cash flow analysis based upon significant assumptions including commodity prices projections of estimated quantities of reserves projections of future rates of production timing and amount of future development and operating costs projected reserve recovery factors and a weighted average cost of capital 

the company utilizes the guideline transaction method to estimate the fair value of unproved properties acquired in a business combination which requires the company to use judgment in considering the value per undeveloped acre in recent comparable transactions to estimate the value of unproved properties 

the estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment generally consisting of pipeline systems and compression stations is estimated using the cost approach which incorporates assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets the relative age of assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence 

the fair values of the intangible assets are estimated using the multiperiod excess earnings model which estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the intangible asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets otherwise recognized the company’s intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and noncompete agreements 

the rice merger resulted in sharebased compensation modification accounting which is treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with total compensation cost equal to the grantdate fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award the calculation of the incremental value is based on the excess of the fair value of the new modified award based on current circumstances over the fair value of the original option measured immediately before its terms are modified based on current circumstances 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to business combinations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must in determining the fair value of assets acquired make assumptions about future commodity prices projections of estimated quantities of reserves projections of future rates of production projections regarding the timing and amount of future development and operating costs and projections of reserve recovery factors per acre values of undeveloped property replacement cost of and future cash flows from midstream assets cash flow from customer relationships and noncompete agreements and the pre and post modification value of stock based awards different assumptions may result in materially different values for these assets which would impact the company’s financial position and future results of operations 

goodwill goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business 

goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company may first consider qualitative factors to assess whether there are indicators that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may not exceed its carrying amount to the extent that such indicators exist a twostep goodwill impairment test is completed the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 

the second step is required which compares the implied fair value of the goodwill of a reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge the company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to goodwill are “critical accounting estimates” because the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management’s estimates of future financial results the fair value estimation process requires considerable judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions impacting management’s estimates of future financial results as well as other assumptions such as movement in the companys stock price weightedaverage cost of capital terminal growth rates and industry multiples the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value are reasonable and appropriate however different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the calculated fair value and the resulting determinations about goodwill impairment which could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial position additionally future estimates may differ materially from current estimates and assumptions 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk and derivative instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian basis and ngls and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas and ngls prices could adversely affect among other things the company’s development plans which would decrease the pace of development and the level of the company’s proved reserves such changes or similar impacts on third party shippers on the companys midstream assets could also impact the company’s revenues earnings or liquidity and could result in material noncash impairments to the recorded value of the company’s property plant and equipment 

the company uses derivatives to reduce the effect of commodity price volatility the companys use of derivatives is further described in notes 1  and 7  to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in the capital resources and liquidity section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of these institutions is regularly monitored the company primarily enters into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s hedge and financial risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted sales of production most of which are hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk the company has an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price swap agreements collar agreements and option agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect a portion of cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company the company hedged portions of expected sales of equity production and portions of its basis exposure covering approximately 2148  bcf of natural gas and 8943  mbbls of ngls as of december 31 2017  and 646 bcf of natural gas and 1095 mbbls of ngls as of december 31 2016  in connection with the rice merger the company assumed all outstanding derivative commodity instruments held by rice which significantly increased the volume of hedges see the “commodity risk management” section in the “capital resources and liquidity” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2017  and 2016  levels would have increased the fair value of these natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 3862 million  and 1790 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2017  and 2016  levels would have decreased the fair value of these natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 3849 million  and 1818 million respectively the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  the price change was then applied to these natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the hypothetical change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted produced gas approximates a portion of the company’s expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced 

above should be offset by a favorable impact on the company’s physical sales of natural gas assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term and the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company eqgp eqm and rmp earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates the company eqm and rmp pay on borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities and the companys floating rate notes all of the company’s and eqm’s senior notes other than the floating rate notes are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s and eqm’s fixed rate debt see notes 14  and 15  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s eqm’s and rmps borrowings as applicable and note 8  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company’s otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole the company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures these include closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 63  or 2420 million  of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2017  had a positive fair value approximately 11 or 331 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2016  had a positive fair value the increase in derivative contracts with a positive fair value primarily relates to decreased forward nymex prices as well as settlements of contracts during 2017 that had a negative fair value as of december 31 2016 

  

as of december 31 2017  the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to its derivative contracts the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales or transportation of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable are generated from the sale of produced natural gas and ngls to certain marketers utility and industrial customers located in the appalachian basin and in markets available through the companys current transportation portfolio which includes markets in the gulf coast midwest and northeast united states the company also contracts with certain processors to market a portion of ngls on behalf of the company similarly revenues and related accounts receivable are generated from the gathering transmission and storage of natural gas in the appalachian basin for independent producers local distribution companies and marketers 

  

no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicates for the eqt eqm or rmp credit facilities holds more than 10 of the respective facility the large syndicate groups and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit the company’s eqms and rmps exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry

business segments 

prior to the october 2016 sale the company reported its results of operations through two business segments eqt production and eqt midstream eqt midstream included the company’s gathering transmission and storage businesses as well as the companys marketing operations that were conducted for the benefit of thirdparties marketing operations for the benefit of eqt production were reported in the eqt production segment these reporting segments reflected the companys lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the company evaluated its operating performance through september 30 2016 following the october 2016 sale the company adjusted its internal reporting structure to align with eqms operations these adjustments included transferring to eqt production i the operation of all midstream assets not owned by eqm and ii marketing operations conducted for the benefit of thirdparties and resulted in changes to the companys reporting segments effective for this annual report on form 10k under the new reporting structure the eqt production segment now includes the company’s production activities all of the companys marketing operations and certain noncore midstream operations primarily supporting the companys production activities the eqt gathering segment contains the companys gathering assets that are included in eqm the eqt transmission segment includes the companys fercregulated interstate pipeline and storage operations the eqt gathering and eqt transmission segments are composed entirely of eqm’s operations and no eqm activities are included within the eqt production segment therefore the financial and operational disclosures related to eqt gathering and eqt transmission in this annual report on form 10k are the same as eqm’s disclosures in its annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2016 the segment disclosures and discussions contained within this report have been recast to reflect the current reporting structure for all periods presented 

eqt production business segment 

  

eqt production holds 135  tcfe of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves across approximately 36 million  gross acres including approximately 790000  gross acres in the marcellus play as of december 31 2016  eqt believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completions in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology eqt production’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves eqt’s proved reserves increased 35  in 2016  primarily as a result of acquisitions the company’s marcellus assets constituted approximately 112  tcfe of the companys total proved reserves as of december 31 2016  

the following illustration depicts eqt’s acreage position within the marcellus play as of december 31 2016  

as of december 31 2016  the company’s proved reserves were as follows 



  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2016  the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by calendar year 2016  produced volumes is 17  years 

the company invested approximately 7830 million  on well development during 2016  with total production sales volumes reaching a record high of 7590  bcfe an increase of 26  over the previous year capital spending for eqt production is expected to be approximately 15 billion  in 2017  excluding acquisitions the majority of which will be used to support the drilling of approximately 207  gross wells including 119  marcellus wells 81  upper devonian wells and 7  utica wells during the past three years the company’s number of wells drilled spud and related capital expenditures for well development were 



  

  includes upper devonian formations 

as a result of the changes to the companys reporting segments effective for this annual report on form 10k the eqt production segment includes approximately 6550 miles of gathering lines the gathering lines which are not owned by eqm primarily support the companys production operations in noncore areas of declining production the gathering lines also gather gas for adjacent thirdparty producers in the huron play revenues for these gathering services are included in pipeline and net marketing services revenues for the eqt production segment these revenues which are expected to decline over time due to declining production in these areas were approximately 234 million  in 2016 

the company optimizes its contractual processing transportation and storage assets to sell natural gas and ngls to marketers utilities and industrial customers within its operational footprint the company provides marketing services for the benefit of eqt production and thirdparties and manages approximately 21  bcf per day of thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity and 685  mmcf per day of firm thirdparty processing capacity for the benefit of eqt production the company has also committed to 129  bcf per day of firm capacity on the mountain valley pipeline mvp and approximately 200 mmcf per day of additional thirdparty contractual capacity expected to come online in future periods the company currently leases 37  bcf of storagerelated assets from third parties

as of december 31 2016 eqt transmissions transmission and storage system included an approximately 950mile fercregulated interstate pipeline that connects to six interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies the six interstate pipelines are texas eastern dominion transmission columbia gas transmission tennessee gas pipeline company rockies express pipeline llc and national fuel gas supply corporation the transmission system is supported by 18 associated natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 645 mmcf per day of peak withdrawal capacity 43 bcf of working gas capacity and 41 compressor units with total throughput capacity of approximately 43 bcf per day as of december 31 2016 

  

in the ordinary course of its business eqt transmission pursues transmission projects aimed at profitably increasing system capacity eqt transmission invested approximately 2920 million  on transmission and storage system infrastructure in 2016 eqt transmission placed the ovc project inservice in 2016 at an estimated total cost of approximately 365 million excluding afudc of which 214 million was spent in 2016 eqt transmission also spent 78 million on other transmission system projects in 2016 these projects increased total throughput capacity by approximately 700 mmcf in 2016 and revenues increased by approximately 403 million  or 135  in 2016 

in 2017 eqt transmission will focus on the following transmission projects 

 



transmission and storage system 

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by profitably developing its undeveloped reserves and effectively and efficiently utilizing eqms extensive gathering and transmission assets that are uniquely positioned across the marcellus upper devonian and utica shales while maintaining an industry leading cost structure 

eqt believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completion in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology over 90 of the company’s acreage is held by production or in fee therefore eqt production is able to develop its acreage in the most economical manner through the use of longer laterals and multiwell pads as opposed to being required to drill lesseconomical wells in order to retain acreage the use of multiwell pads in conjunction with a completion technique known as reduced cluster spacing has the additional benefit of reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the company’s drilling operations 

  

eqms midstream assets span a wide area of the marcellus upper devonian and utica shales in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia this footprint provides a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the company for continued growth eqm intends to capitalize on the growing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in this region including the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia 

the ongoing efforts of eqgp and eqm are an important support mechanism for eqt’s overall business strategy through capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities and attracting additional thirdparty volumes eqm is expected to grow profitably and provide an ongoing source of capital to the company

markets and customers 

  

natural gas sales  the company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian basin and the northeastern united states the company’s current transportation portfolio also enables the company to reach markets along the gulf coast and midwestern portions of the united states natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company typically receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to the price at henry hub louisiana the location for pricing nymex natural gas futures as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the northeast region in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production most of which is hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth under the heading “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1  and 6  to the consolidated financial statements 

the company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas in mid2011 eqt opened a publicaccess natural gas fueling station in pittsburgh pennsylvania as a result of growing demand for compressed natural gas for numerous fleets throughout the region the station added two more dispensers in 2013 in addition the company promotes the use of natural gas with its own fleet vehicles and plans to operate 11 of its lightduty vehicle fleet more than 110 vehicles on natural gas by the end of 2017 all of the companys contracted drilling rigs and completion crews utilize natural gas 

ngls sales   the company sells ngls from its own gas production and from gas marketed for third parties in its appalachian operations the company primarily contracts with markwest energy partners lp markwest to process natural gas in order to extract the heavier hydrocarbon stream consisting predominately of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline primarily from eqt production’s produced gas the company also contracts with markwest to market ngls with the exception of ethane the company also has contractual processing arrangements with williams ohio valley midstream llc to market ngls on behalf of the company in its appalachian operations in its permian basin operations the company sells gas to thirdparty processors at a weighted average liquids component price 

the following table presents the average sales price on an average per mcfe basis to eqt corporation for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without cash settled derivatives for the years ended december 31 



  

in addition price information for all products is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “consolidated operational data” and incorporated herein by reference 

  

natural gas gathering eqt production accounted for approximately 96  and 91  of eqt gatherings gathering revenues and volumes respectively for 2016 

 eqt gathering has various firm gas gathering agreements which provide for firm reservation fees in certain high pressure development areas including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which eqm had entered into firm gathering agreements approximately 25 bcf per day of firm gathering capacity was subscribed under firm gathering contracts as of december 31 2016 the weighted average remaining term of eqt gatherings firm gathering contracts was approximately 9 years as of december 31 2016 based on total projected contracted revenues 

on eqt gathering’s low pressure fercregulated gathering system the primary term of a typical gathering agreement is one year with monthtomonth roll over provisions terminable upon at least 30 days notice the rates for gathering service on the regulated system are based on the maximum posted tariff rate and assessed on actual receipts into the gathering system eqt gathering retains a percentage of wellhead natural gas receipts to recover natural gas used to run its compressor stations and for other requirements on all of its gathering systems 

  

natural gas transmission and storage eqt transmissions customers are affiliates and thirdparties primarily in the northeastern united states in 2016  approximately 73  of transmission volumes and 51  of transmission revenues were from eqt production other customers include local distribution companies other independent producers and marketers in the appalachian basin 

eqt transmission generally does not take title to the natural gas transported or stored for its customers eqt transmission generally provides transmission and storage services in two manners firm service and interruptible service the fixed monthly fee under a firm contract is referred to as a capacity reservation fee which is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the contracted volume regardless of the amount of natural gas that is transported or stored in addition to capacity reservation fees eqt transmission may also collect usage fees when a firm transmission customer uses the capacity it has reserved under these firm transmission contracts where applicable the usage fees are assessed on the actual volume of natural gas transported on the system a firm customer is billed an additional usage fee on volumes in excess of firm capacity when the level of natural gas received for delivery from the customer exceeds its reserved capacity customers are not assured capacity or service for volumes in excess of firm capacity on the applicable pipeline as these volumes have the same priority as interruptible service 

under interruptible service contracts customers pay usage fees based on their actual utilization of assets customers that have executed interruptible contracts are not assured capacity or service on the applicable systems to the extent that physical capacity that is contracted for firm service is not fully utilized or excess capacity that has not been contracted for service exists the system can allocate such capacity to interruptible services 

including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which eqm has entered into firm contracts approximately 47 bcf per day of transmission capacity and 313 bcf of storage capacity respectively were subscribed under firm transmission and storage contracts as of december 31 2016 eqt transmissions firm transmission and storage contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 16 years as of december 31 2016 based on total projected contracted revenues 

as of december 31 2016 approximately 92 of eqt transmissions contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff the remaining 8 of eqt transmission’s contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed at the recourse rates under its tariff which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff 

eqt transmission has an acreage dedication from eqt pursuant to which eqt transmission has the right to elect to transport on its transmission and storage system all natural gas produced from wells drilled by eqt under an area covering approximately 60000 acres in allegheny washington and greene counties in pennsylvania and wetzel marion taylor tyler doddridge harrison and lewis counties in west virginia eqt has a significant natural gas drilling program in these areas 

  

natural gas marketing   eqt energy llc eqt energy eqts indirect wholly owned marketing subsidiary provides marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of eqt production and thirdparties eqt energy also engages in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of eqt production the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices eqt energy leases thirdparty storage capacity in order to take advantage of seasonal spreads where available 

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of eqts total operating revenues for 2016  one  customer within the eqt production segment accounted for approximately 10  and 12  of eqts total operating revenues in 2015  and 2014  respectively the company believes that the loss of this customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the companys natural gas are available 

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production transportation and sale of natural gas and ngls and the securing of services labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators competition for natural gas gathering transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates customer commitment levels timing performance commercial terms reliability service levels location reputation and fuel efficiencies key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines key competitors for gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies eqt competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and ngls some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers 

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing eqt production’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties kentucky ohio virginia and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia the company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus and upper devonian acreage in 2013 the pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases and texas permits similar joint development in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and texas sets production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

  

the companys gathering and transmission operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations and transmission facilities these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

  

the companys interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the ferc and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the ferc for instance the ferc approves tariffs that establish eqm’s rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service applicable to its fercregulated assets the fees or rates established under eqm’s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority over transmission operations also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

in 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other cftc rules that may be relevant to the company have yet to be finalized because significant cftc rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company has experienced increased and expects additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

  

regulators periodically review or audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the us congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the company 

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing operating and abandoning wells pipelines and related facilities 

  

the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations the company conducts baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of the companys drilling pads legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells 

see note 20  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of expenditures related to environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation the epa and various states have issued a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that 

limit greenhouse gas emissions legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 

  

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position depend upon the prices for natural gas ngls and oil the prices for natural gas ngls and oil have historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions and seasonal trends the supply of and demand for natural gas ngls and oil regional basis differentials national and worldwide economic and political conditions new and competing exploratory finds of natural gas ngls and oil the ability to export liquefied natural gas the effect of energy conservation efforts the price and availability of alternative fuels the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil were depressed throughout 2015 and 2016 the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 376  per mmbtu to a low of 149  per mmbtu from january 1 2015 through december 31 2016 and the daily spot prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 6113  per barrel to a low of 2651  per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian basis ngls and oil and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations however we do expect natural gas and ngls prices particularly in the appalachian basin to remain depressed during 2017 

the depressed price environment for natural gas ngls and oil during 2015 and 2016 has resulted in lower revenues operating income and cash flows prolonged low andor significant or extended further declines in natural gas ngls and oil prices may result in further decreases in our revenues operating income and cash flows which may result in reductions in drilling activity delays in the construction of new midstream infrastructure and downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit ratings further declines in prices could also adversely affect the amount of natural gas ngls and oil that we can produce economically which may result in the company having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur additional noncash impairment charges to earnings in future periods see “impairment of oil and gas properties” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “recent natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods” moreover a failure to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngls and oil prices could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value 

increases in natural gas ngls and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral provided to our hedge counterparties which is interestbearing is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas   

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the operations for drilling producing transporting and storing natural gas ngls and oil such as well site blowouts cratering and explosions pipe and other equipment and system failures fires formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures freeze offs of wells and pipelines due to cold weather pollution and environmental risks and natural disasters we also face various threats to the security of our or third parties’ facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants compressor stations and pipelines these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment pollution or other environmental damage disruptions to our operations regulatory investigations and penalties and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

our failure to develop obtain access or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas ngls and oil to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of natural gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities the capacity of transmission gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil competition for pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could affect our competitive position the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure through eqm is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transmission pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions natural gas ngls and oil price volatility delays in obtaining permits and other government approvals title and property access problems geology public opposition to infrastructure development compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors moreover if our infrastructure development and maintenance programs are not successfully developed on time and within budget we may not be able to profitably fulfill our contractual obligations to third parties including joint venture partners 

we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty natural gas ngls and oil transmission gathering processing and storage facilities that are limited in number geographically concentrated and subject to the same risks identified above with respect to our infrastructure development and maintenance programs because we do not own these thirdparty pipelines or facilities their continuing operation is not within our control an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil in such an event we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor sell our production at prices lower than market prices or at prices lower than we currently project in addition some of our thirdparty contracts involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part moreover our usage of third parties for transmission gathering and processing services subjects us to the credit and performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market 

also our producing properties and operations are primarily in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas as a result we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production caused by transportation capacity constraints curtailment of production availability of equipment facilities personnel or services significant governmental regulation natural disasters adverse weather conditions plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of natural gas and ngls produced from this area 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2017 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development reserve acquisitions exploratory activities midstream infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital    notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2017 plan 

business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies including the appropriate corporate structure appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2017 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering and transmission systems and pipelines our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of water and other fluids and materials including solid wastes incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas resources 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties some states allow the statutory pooling and unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration as well as joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air ground and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling and pipeline construction environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety including replacement requirements and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business or result in delays due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed governmental approvals and permits these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transmission and storage businesses are in many cases subject to federal regulation by the ferc which may prohibit us from realizing a level of return that we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of lower overall rates imputed revenue credits cost disallowances andor expense deferrals for example under current policy the ferc permits interstate pipelines to include an income tax allowance in the costofservice used as the basis for calculating their regulated rates for pipelines owned by partnerships including eqm the tax allowance reflects the actual or potential income tax liability on the fercjurisdictional income attributable to all partnership interests if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income if the ferc’s income tax allowance policy which is subject of legal challenges were to change and if the ferc were to disallow all or a substantial portion of the current income tax 

allowance for eqm’s pipelines eqm’s regulated rates and therefore its revenues could be materially adversely affected which eventually could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows 

certain natural gas gathering facilities are exempted from regulation by the ferc we believe that many of our natural gas facilities meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company although the ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to the jurisdictional status of those facilities however the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation within the industry so the classification and regulation of some of our facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or the us congress 

failure to comply with applicable provisions of the laws governing the regulation and safety of natural gas gathering transmission and storage facilities as well as with the regulations rules orders restrictions and conditions associated with these laws could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties for example the ferc is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately 12 million per violation per day for violations of the natural gas act of 1938 the natural gas policy act of 1978 or the rules regulations restrictions conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes the violation of federal pipeline safety laws could lead to the imposition of civil penalties of up to 200000 per day for each violation up to a maximum penalty of 2000000 for a related series of violations this maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming in addition to periodic changes to air water and waste laws as well as recent epa initiatives to impose climate changebased air regulations on the industry the us congress and various states have been evaluating and in certain cases have enacted climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

another area of regulation is hydraulic fracturing which we utilize to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation or regulation has been proposed or is under discussion at federal state and local levels for instance legislation or regulation banning hydraulic fracturing has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions in which we do not have drilling operations we cannot predict whether any other such federal state or local legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how it may affect our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs result in delays in production or delivery of natural gas or perhaps even preclude us from drilling wells 

  

proposals that could potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal and collaterally state income taxes of independent producers are occasionally discussed in connection with the federal budget with the potential repeal of the ability to expense intangible drilling costs having the most significant potential future impact to us other tax reform proposals could accelerate tangible drilling cost deductions as a replacement for interest expense deductions some of these changes if enacted could make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our natural gas resources 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production often fluctuate and could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

in 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that established federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as us that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10k the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including us such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other rules that may be relevant to us or our counterparties have yet to be finalized because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on our hedging program including available counterparties or regulatory compliance obligations we have experienced increased and anticipate additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

  

we and eqm rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including access to capital markets and changes in the terms of and cost of capital including increases in interest rates may adversely affect our or eqms business and financial condition our and eqms ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we or eqm desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our or eqms flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions or our ability to implement our business strategies adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas ngls and oil which could have a negative impact on our and eqms revenues and credit ratings 

  

as of february 8 2017 our longterm debt was rated “baa3” by moody’s investors services moody’s “bbb” by standard  poor’s ratings service sp and “bbb” by fitch ratings service fitch and eqms longterm debt was rated “ba1” by moodys “bbb” by sp and “bbb” by fitch although we are not aware of any current plans of moody’s sp or fitch to lower their respective ratings on our or eqm’s debt we cannot be assured that our or eqm’s credit ratings will not be downgraded or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency low prices for natural gas ngls and oil or an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our or eqm’s debt if any credit rating agency downgrades the ratings particularly below investment grade our or eqm’s access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits on our derivatives would increase we may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of pipeline capacity contracts the amount of which may be substantial or we or eqm may be required to provide additional credit assurances related to joint venture arrangements or construction contracts which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity investment grade refers to the quality of a company’s credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies in order to be considered investment grade the company must be rated “bbb” or higher by sp “baa3” or higher by moody’s and “bbb” or higher by fitch 

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things oil spills the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing and pipeline projects may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

cyber incidents may adversely impact our operations 

  

our business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications to operate our production and midstream businesses and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our systems or infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas ngls and oil difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve we 

may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents 

our failure to assess or capitalize on production opportunities could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a well is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the natural gas ngls and oil to market moreover an incorrect determination of legal title to our wells could result in liability to the owner of the natural gas or oil rights and an impairment to our assets successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect for example seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas or other hydrocarbons certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful this failure could adversely affect our business results of operations or liquidity because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

recent natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties and midstream assets for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events the estimated future cash flows used to test our proved oil and gas properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the company’s management for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil future operating costs and inflation commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality basis and inflation proved oil and gas properties and midstream assets that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

our estimate of the fair value of our assets depends on the prices of natural gas ngls and oil primarily as a result of declines in nymex forward strip prices we recorded noncash pretax impairment charges of 597 million  to certain longlived assets during 2016 and 943 million  and 1052 million  to our proved oil and gas properties in the noncore permian basin during 2015 and 2014 respectively future declines in natural gas ngls or oil prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance among other things may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves andor could result in additional noncash impairment charges to writedown the carrying amount of our assets which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods for example all other things being equal a further decline in the average fiveyear nymex forward strip price in a future period may cause the company to recognize impairments on noncore assets including the companys assets in the huron play which had a carrying value of approximately 3 billion  at december 31 2016 see “impairment of oil and gas properties” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the amount and timing of actual future natural gas ngls and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngls and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas ngls and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause 

production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

we also rely on third parties for certain construction drilling and completion services materials and supplies delays or failures to perform by such third parties could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and oil reserves 

  

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil the amount timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngls and oil industry in general 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs some of which are beyond our control these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

principal facilities are owned or in the case of certain office locations warehouse buildings and equipment leased by the company’s business segments the majority of the company’s properties are located on or under i private properties owned in fee held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles or ii public highways under franchises or permits from various governmental authorities the company’s facilities are generally well maintained and where appropriate are replaced or expanded to meet operating requirements 

  

eqt production   eqt production’s properties are located primarily in pennsylvania west virginia kentucky and virginia this segment has approximately 36 million  gross acres approximately 70  of which are considered undeveloped which encompass substantially all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil producing properties approximately 790000  of these gross acres are located in the marcellus play although most of its wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths  2000  to 8000  feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2016  the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 135  tcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 66  tcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 02  tcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 67  tcfe substantially all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations 

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngls and oil reserves is prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for preparing the reserve report and the technical aspects of the reserves audit received a bachelor’s degree 

in chemical engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has 19 years  of experience in the oil and gas industry to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally division of interest and production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve reconciliation between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngls and oil reserves is audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp ryder scott which is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally in the course of its audit ryder scott reviewed 100  of the total net natural gas ngls and oil proved reserves attributable to the company’s interests as of december 31 2016  ryder scott conducted a detailed well by well audit of the company’s largest properties this audit covered 82  of the company’s proved developed reserves ryder scott’s audit of the remaining approximately 18  of the company’s proved developed properties consisted of an audit of aggregated groups not exceeding 200  wells per case for operated wells and 231  wells per case for nonoperated wells for undeveloped locations the company determined and ryder scott reviewed and approved the areas within the company’s acreage considered to be proven for undeveloped locations reserves were assigned and projected by the company’s reserves engineers for locations within these proven areas and approved by ryder scott based on analogous type curves and offset production information ryder scott’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 99

the company’s average per unit production cost excluding production taxes of natural gas ngls and oil during 2016  2015  and 2014  was 015  per mcfe 019  per mcfe and 024  per mcfe respectively at december 31 2016  the company had approximately 50  multiple completion wells 



  

summary of proved natural gas oil and ngl reserves as of december 31 2016  based on average fiscal year prices 





as of december 31 2016  the company had no  proved undeveloped reserves that remained undeveloped for more than five years 

as of december 31 2016  leases associated with approximately 25700  gross undeveloped acres expire in 2017  if they are not renewed the company has an active lease renewal program in areas targeted for development within the marcellus formation the company has no requirements to drill any wells in 2017  within its lease and acquisition agreements 

  

number of net productive and dry exploratory and development wells drilled 



the increase in dry developmental wells in 2016 was primarily related to vertical wells that are no longer planned to be drilled horizontally due to the uncertainty of identifying a nearterm pipeline solution 

the table below provides select production sales and acreage data by state as of december 31 2016  unless otherwise noted which is substantially all from the appalachian basin ngls and oil were converted to mcfe at the rate of six  mcfe per barrel for all periods refer to the table on page 38 for sales volumes by final product

the company sells natural gas within the appalachian basin and in markets accessible through its transportation portfolio under a variety of contractual agreements some of which specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities the company expects to fulfill these delivery commitments with existing proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2016  the company’s delivery commitments through 2021  were as follows 



capital expenditures at eqt production totaled 21 billion  during 2016  including 13 billion  for the acquisition of properties the company invested approximately 6231 million  during 2016 developing proved reserves and approximately 1600 million  on wells still in progress at year end during the year ended december 31 2016 the company converted 647 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves the company had additions to proved developed reserves of 693 bcfe including 320 bcfe from acquired wells and 341 bcfe from wells developed in 2016 that had not previously been classified as proved the acquisition of acreage added 2076 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves which was partially offset by 389 bcfe of economic reserves that are no longer anticipated to be drilled within 5 years of booking and 138 bcfe of reserves associated 

with wells that are no longer economic as determined in accordance with sec pricing requirements as of december 31 2016  the company’s proved undeveloped reserves totaled 67  tcfe 100  of which is associated with the development of the marcellus including upper devonian play all proved undeveloped drilling locations are expected to be drilled within five  years 

  

the company’s 2016  extensions discoveries and other additions totaled 2385  bcfe which exceeded the 2016  production of 776  bcfe of these reserves 2044 bcfe are attributed to the addition of proved undeveloped locations in the company’s pennsylvania and west virginia marcellus fields and 341 bcfe are from the development of locations not previously booked as proved

environmental proceedings 

phoenix s impoundment tioga county pennsylvania 

in june and august 2012 the company received three notices of violation novs from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the padep the novs alleged violations of the pennsylvania oil and gas act and clean streams law in connection with the unintentional release in may 2012 by a company vendor of water from an impaired water pit at a company well location in tioga county pennsylvania since confirming a release the company has cooperated with the padep in remediating the affected areas 

  

during the second quarter of 2014 the company received a proposed consent assessment of civil penalty from the padep that proposed a civil penalty related to the novs on september 19 2014 the company filed a declaratory judgment action in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania against the padep seeking a court ruling on the padep’s legal interpretation of the penalty provisions of the clean streams law which interpretation the company believed was legally flawed and unsupportable on october 7 2014 based on its interpretation of the penalty provisions the padep filed a complaint against the company before the pennsylvania environmental hearing board the ehb seeking 453 million in civil penalties a hearing before the ehb was held in july 2016and the company expects the ehbs decision by midyear 2017 in january 2017 the commonwealth court ruled in favor of the company finding the padep’s interpretation of the penalty provisions of the clean streams law erroneous and the padep appealed that decision to the pennsylvania supreme court while the company expects the padep’s claims to result in penalties that exceed 100000 the company expects the resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company

trans energy inc matter west virginia 

as described in note 9  to the consolidated financial statements the company completed the acquisition of trans energy inc trans energy on december 5 2016 as a result trans energy is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of eqt between 2009 and 2011 trans energy received several novs from the west virginia department of environmental protection the wvdep as well as seven compliance orders from the epa the novs and compliance orders alleged various violations of the federal clean water act related to the filling of streams and wetlands to create impoundments at several well pads in marshall wetzel and marion counties west virginia 

on august 25 2014 trans energy entered into a civil consent decree with the epa the consent decree to settle the various violations of the clean water act the consent decree required the payment of a 3 million civil penalty trans energy paid 125 million of the penalty prior to the companys acquisition of trans energy the remaining 175 million will be paid by eqt on or before april 21 2017 the consent decree also requires among other things numerous restoration activities associated with impoundments well pads and access roads in west virginia at an estimated cost of 10  15 million 

on october 1 2014 trans energy pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor charges filed by the united states attorney for the northern district of west virginia related to the same violations of the clean water act that were the subject of the consent decree in connection with this plea agreement the plea agreement trans energy paid a 600000 fine and was placed on probation until april 2017 

finally on december 21 2015 trans energy entered into an administrative agreement with the epa’s office of suspension and debarment to resolve all matters relating to suspension debarment and statutory disqualification arising from the plea agreement the administrative agreement requires among other things trans energy to comply with the plea agreement and consent decree prepare semiannual compliance reports and retain an independent monitor to certify trans energy’s compliance as a result of the company’s acquisition of trans energy the company is currently working with the epa’s office of suspension and debarment to agree to an amendment to or possible termination of the administrative agreement

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

the table below reconciles eqt production adjusted operating revenues a nongaap supplemental financial measure to eqt corporation total operating revenues as reported in the statements of consolidated operations its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 

eqt production adjusted operating revenues also referred to as total natural gas  liquids sales including cash settled derivatives is presented because it is an important measure used by the company’s management to evaluate periodoverperiod comparisons of earnings trends eqt production adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services management utilizes eqt production adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement eqt production adjusted operating revenues also excludes pipeline and net marketing services because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to the revenues for its natural gas and liquids production pipeline and net marketing services primarily includes revenues for gathering services provided to thirdparties as well as both the cost of and recoveries on thirdparty pipeline capacity not used for eqt production sales volumes management further believes that eqt production adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating periodoverperiod earnings trends 



business segment results of operations 

  

business segment operating results from continuing operations are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income other income interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget unallocated expenses consist primarily of incentive compensation and administrative costs in 2016 unallocated expenses also included impairment of longlived assets of approximately 597 million  related to certain gathering assets sold to eqm in october 2016 this impairment was recorded by eqt midstream prior to the sale and change in segments discussed below and does not relate to any of the recast segments 

  

the company has reported the components of each segment’s operating income from continuing operations and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived eqt’s management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition operations and trends of each of eqt’s business segments without being obscured by the financial condition operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest income taxes and other income in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income to the company’s consolidated operating income and net income in note 5  to the consolidated financial statements

total operating revenues were 13871 million  for 2016  compared to 21317 million  for 2015  sales of natural gas oil and ngls decreased as a result of a lower average realized price partly offset by a 26  increase in production sales volumes in 2016 eqt production received 2794 million  and 1721 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively that are included in the average realized price but are not in gaap operating revenues changes in fair market value of derivative instruments prior to settlement are recognized in gain loss on derivatives not designated as hedges the increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus play partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells 

the 062  per mcfe decrease in the average realized price for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily due to the decrease in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of 053  per mcf and a decrease in the average natural gas differential of 012  per mcf the decrease in the average differential primarily related to lower basis partly offset by favorable cash settled basis swaps while appalachian basin basis improved slightly for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 basis in the united states northeast was significantly lower particularly in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to reduced demand attributable to warmer than normal weather conditions additionally the impact of changes in natural gas prices on physical basis sales contracts and fixed price sales contracts reduced basis year over year the company started flowing eqt production’s produced volumes to its rockies express pipeline capacity and texas eastern transmission gulf markets pipeline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to basis in 2016 

pipeline and net marketing services primarily includes gathering revenues for gathering services provided to thirdparties and both the cost of and recoveries on thirdparty pipeline capacity not used to transport the company’s produced volumes the 145 million  decrease in these revenues primarily related to reduced spreads on the company’s tennessee gas pipeline capacity

results of operations 



 

year ended december 31 2016  vs december 31 2015   

  

transmission and storage revenues increased by 403 million  firm reservation revenues increased due to affiliates contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts primarily on the ovc as well as higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year higher usage fees under firm contracts were driven by an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the marcellus shale partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 these volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather in the first quarter of 2016 this decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues usage fees under interruptible contracts for the year ended december 31 2016 increased as a result of higher third party volumes transported or stored on an interruptible basis 

operating expenses increased by 101 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in operating and maintenance expense resulted primarily from higher repairs and maintenance expenses associated with increased throughput selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from eqt the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of higher depreciation on the increased investment in transmission infrastructure including those associated with the ovc and the avc facilities

income taxes 



all of eqgps income is included in the companys pretax income loss however the company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portions of eqgps income allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners of eqgp and eqm which reduces the companys effective tax rate in periods when the company has consolidated pretax income and increases the companys effective tax rate in periods when the company has consolidated pretax loss 

  

for federal income tax purposes the company may deduct a portion of its drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idcs in the year incurred idcs however are sometimes limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt and can result in the company paying amt even when generating large tax deductions or utilizing a net operating loss nol carryforward 

for 2016 the company is in a breakeven federal taxable income position and is paying a small amount of tax for 2015 and 2014 the company paid a larger amount of tax as a result of the large tax gains generated from eqgp’s ipo in 2015 the nwv gathering transaction in 2015 and the jupiter transaction in 2014 defined in note 4  to the consolidated financial statements 

see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s income tax benefit expense 

  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 



  

the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for all periods was primarily the result of increased net income at eqm increased ownership of eqm common units by thirdparties and eqgps ipo in 2015 

outlook 

  

the company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas and ngls reserves through environmentally responsible costeffective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling the company’s revenues earnings liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for and the company’s ability to develop its reserves of natural gas and ngls despite the continued low price environment for natural gas and ngls the company believes the longterm outlook for its business is favorable due to the companys resource base low cost structure financial strength risk management including commodity hedging strategy and disciplined investment of capital the company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area 

the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 376  per mmbtu to a low of 149  per mmbtu from january 1 2015 through december 31 2016 in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin was lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian basis and ngls and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations 

the companys 2017 capital expenditure forecast for well development is 13 billion  which is 66  higher than its 2016 capital expenditures for well development changes in natural gas ngls and oil prices could affect among other things the companys development plans which would increase or decrease the pace of the development and the level of the companys reserves as well as the companys revenues earnings or liquidity significant changes in prices may result in an increase or decrease in capital spending lower prices could result in additional noncash impairments in the book value of the company’s oil and gas properties or additional downward adjustments to the company’s estimated proved reserves any such additional impairment andor downward adjustment to the company’s estimated reserves could potentially be material to the company see “impairment of oil and gas properties” below 

in july 2015 the company turned inline its first dry gas focused utica well which experienced prolific initial results the company has subsequently turned inline 4 additional utica wells located in greene county pennsylvania and wetzel county west virginia with 2 additional wells spud but not yet complete as of december 31 2016 given the results of its initial utica wells the company will continue development of its utica acreage in 2017 

total capital investment by eqt in 2017 excluding acquisitions is expected to be approximately 20 billion  including eqm capital spending for well development primarily drilling and completion of approximately 13 billion  in 2017  is expected to support the drilling of approximately 207  gross wells including 119  marcellus wells 81  upper devonian wells and 7  utica wells estimated sales volumes are expected to be 810  830 bcfe which includes volume growth of approximately 60 bcfe the majority of which stems from the previous years drilling program the majority of the volume expected from the 2017 drilling program will be realized in 2018 at which time eqt forecasts production volume growth of 15  20 per year for several years the anticipated production sales volume growth is approximately 8  in 2017  while total ngls volumes are expected to be 13200  13800 mbbls to support continued growth in production the company plans to invest approximately 05 billion  on midstream infrastructure through eqm the 2017  capital investment plan for eqt production is expected to be funded by cash generated from operations cash on hand and sales of trading securities eqms available sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations borrowings under its credit facilities cash on hand debt offerings and issuances of additional eqm partnership interests 

the company continues to focus on creating and maximizing shareholder value through the implementation of a strategy that economically accelerates the monetization of its asset base and prudently pursues investment opportunities all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with solid cash flow the company monitors current and expected market conditions including the commodity price environment and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly while the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions the company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for redeployment into its highest value development opportunities the company continues to pursue transactions that would add to its marcellus upper devonian and utica positions and would consider purchasing assets or companies of various sizes within those positions 

impairment of oil and gas properties 

see “critical accounting policies and estimates” below and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company’s accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the company’s oil and gas properties due to declines in the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices during 2015 and into 2016 the company determined that indicators of potential impairment existed for certain of the company’s proved oil and gas properties as of december 31 2016 in accordance with its normal procedures the company estimated the future undiscounted cash flows from these oil and gas properties and compared these estimates to the carrying value of the properties based on these evaluations the company determined that no impairment existed during 2016 although the company did not record an impairment on its oil and gas producing properties during 2016 all other things being equal a further decline in the average fiveyear nymex forward strip price in a future period may cause the company to recognize impairments on noncore assets including the companys assets in the huron play which had a carrying value of approximately 3 billion  at december 31 2016 

as described under “critical accounting policies and estimates” below the company makes a number of assumptions related to its evaluation of its oil and gas properties for impairment many of which require the company’s management to make significant judgments these assumptions which are generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the company’s management for internal planning and budgeting purposes include among other things anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted accordingly for basis differentials future operating and capital costs and inflation future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil are often volatile and assumptions regarding basis differentials future production and future operating costs are highly judgmental and in some cases difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in and the interdependence of these factors the company cannot predict if future impairment charges including impairment charges related to its huron oil and gas properties will be recognized and if so an estimate of the impairment charges that would be recorded in any future period see “recent natural gas ngls and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore assets future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well 

performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods” under item 1a “risk factors” 

capital resources and liquidity

the companys cash flows from operating activities will be impacted by future movements in the market price for commodities the company is unable to predict these future price movements see natural gas ngls and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngls and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position under item 1a risk factors for further information 

investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 29615 million  for 2016 as compared to 25256 million  for 2015 the 4359 million  increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures for acquisitions of 10512 million  and investments in trading securities of 2888 million  partly offset by a reduction in the drilling and completions capital expenditures during 2016 the company invested in trading securities which consist of liquid debt securities carried at fair value to maximize returns the company also placed 750 million  of the proceeds received from the sale of a gathering system into restricted cash for a potential likekind exchange for tax purposes 

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 25256 million  for 2015 as compared to 24442 million  for 2014 the 814 million  increase was primarily attributable to a 1567 million  increase in capital expenditures and 745 million of net capital contributions made to the mvp joint venture through eqm during 2015 partly offset by 1742 million of capital expenditures in 2014 in connection with the 2014 exchange of assets with range resources

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005 the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco the savings guarantees provided that once the energyefficiency construction was completed by noresco the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately 115 million  as of december 31 2016 extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 12 years  

as of december 31 2016  eqm had issued a 91 million  performance guarantee the initial guarantee in connection with the obligations of mvp holdco llc mvp holdco to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the mvp upon the ferc’s initial release to begin construction of the mvp the initial guarantee will terminate and eqm will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to 33  of mvp holdco’s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the mvp joint venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget less subject to certain limits any credit assurances issued by an affiliate of eqm under such affiliates precedent agreement with the mvp joint venture 

the noresco guarantees and the initial guarantee are exempt from asc topic 460 guarantees the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

rate regulation 

  

as described under “regulation” in item 1 “business” the company’s transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation as described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

schedule of contractual obligations 

the table below presents the company’s longterm contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 in total and by periods purchase obligations exclude the company’s contractual obligations relating to its binding precedent agreements and other natural gas transmission and gathering capacity agreements with eqm for which future payments related to such agreements totaled 60 billion  as of december 31 2016 these capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years for a description of the transportation agreements see note 20  to the consolidated financial statements purchase obligations also exclude future capital contributions to the mvp joint venture and purchase obligations of the mvp joint venture 



  

 

purchase obligations are primarily commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various unconsolidated pipelines including commitments from the company to the mvp joint venture some of which extend up to approximately 20 years the company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties purchase obligations also include commitments with third parties for processing capacity in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program the obligations for the company’s various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately 441 million  as of december 31 2016 the company has agreements with several drillers to provide drilling equipment and services to the company over the next four years these obligations totaled approximately 609 million  as of december 31 2016 

the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2016 eqt value driver award program and 2016 restricted stock unit liability awards see “critical accounting policies and estimates” below and note 18  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations 

as discussed in note 10  to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2016 of 2524 million  of which 754 million  is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

commitments and contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity

recently issued accounting standards 

the companys recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a fieldbyfield basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the companys management for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the intended use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted accordingly for basis differentials future operating costs and inflation some of which are interdependent proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes in development plans resulting from economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves prior to their expirations the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made 

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls future production costs estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of those recoveries see impairment of oil and gas properties above and note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices operating costs economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the companys financial statements including strength of the balance sheet 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas ngls and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the 12month period which is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using statutory future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see impairment of oil and gas properties above for additional information regarding the company’s oil and gas reserves 

  

income taxes  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward incentive compensation unrealized hedge losses and investment in eqgp the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the federal and state nol carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 10  to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

derivative instruments the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use marketbased parameters as inputs including forward curves discount rates volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a riskfree instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or market conditions or other factors change many of which are beyond the company’s control 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices both nymex and basis future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are spud the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation  the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock timebased restricted units and stock options awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant 

  

restricted units and performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards for liability awards the company is required to estimate on grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through and value of the company’s common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s common stock adjusted for any expected changes and where applicable of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period historically three years for director phantom units which vest on date of grant expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company’s financial statements in the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based upon the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

  

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically two or three years the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see note 18  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s sharebased compensation 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk and derivative instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian basis and ngls and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas and ngls prices could adversely affect among other things the company’s development plans which would decrease the pace of development and the level of the company’s proved reserves such changes or similar impacts on thirdparty shippers on the companys midstream assets could also impact the company’s revenues earnings or liquidity and could result in a material noncash impairment in the recorded value of the company’s property plant and equipment 

in addition to the ability to elect to slow capital spending in periods of prolonged low andor significant declines in natural gas and ngls prices the company uses derivatives to reduce the effect of commodity price volatility the companys use of derivatives is further described in notes 1  and 6  to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in the capital resources and liquidity section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of these institutions is regularly monitored the company primarily enters into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge basis and exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s hedge and financial risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted sales of production most of which are hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk the company has an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect a portion of cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company the company hedged portions of expected sales of equity production and portions of its basis exposure covering approximately 646  bcf of natural gas and 1095  mbbls of ngls as of december 31 2016  and 664 bcf of natural gas as of december 31 2015  see the “commodity risk management” section in the “capital resources and liquidity” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2016  and 2015  levels would have increased the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1790 million  and 1371 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2016  and 2015  levels would have decreased the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1818 million  and 1384 million respectively the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the price change was then applied to the natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted produced gas approximates a portion of the company’s expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments 

held to hedge the company’s forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on the company’s physical sales of natural gas assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term and the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company eqgp and eqm earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates the company and eqm pay on borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities all of the company’s and eqm’s longterm borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s and eqm’s fixed rate debt see notes 13  and 14  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s and eqm’s borrowings and note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company’s overthecounter otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole the company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures these include closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 11  or 331 million  of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2016  had a positive fair value approximately 95 or 4174 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2015  had a positive fair value the decrease in derivative contracts with a positive fair value primarily relates to increased forward nymex prices as well as settlements of contracts during 2016 that had a positive fair value as of december 31 2015 

  

as of december 31 2016  the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to its derivative contracts the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales or transportation of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable are generated from the sale of produced natural gas and ngls to certain marketers utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian basin and the northeastern united states as well as the permian basin of texas and a gas processor in kentucky and west virginia the company’s current transportation portfolio also enables the company to reach markets along the gulf coast and midwestern portions of the united states similarly revenues and related accounts receivable are generated from the gathering transmission and storage of natural gas in the appalachian basin for independent producers local distribution companies and marketers 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that expires in february 2019 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company as of december 31 2016  the company had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry 

eqm has a 750 million revolving credit facility that expires in february 2019 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by eqm as of december 31 2016  eqm had no  borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility eqm’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit eqm’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry

general 

  

eqt corporation eqt or the company conducts its business through two  business segments eqt production and eqt midstream eqt production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the appalachian basin with 100  tcfe of proved natural gas ngl and crude oil reserves across approximately 34 million  gross acres including approximately 630000  gross acres in the marcellus play as of december 31 2015  eqt midstream provides gathering transmission and storage services for the company’s produced gas as well as for independent third parties across the appalachian basin primarily through its ownership and control of eqt midstream partners lp eqm nyse eqm a publicly traded limited partnership formed by eqt to own operate acquire and develop midstream assets in the appalachian basin 

in 2015 the company formed eqt gp holdings lp eqgp nyse eqgp a delaware limited partnership to own the companys partnership interests including the incentive distribution rights in eqm as of december 31 2015 the company owned the entire noneconomic general partner interest and 239715000 common units which represented a 901 limited partner interest in eqgp as of december 31 2015  eqgp owned the following eqm partnership interests which represent eqgps only cashgenerating assets 21811643  eqm common units representing a 276  limited partner interest in eqm 1443015  eqm general partner units representing a 18  general partner interest in eqm and all of eqms incentive distribution rights or idrs which entitle eqgp to receive up to 480  of all incremental cash distributed in a quarter after 05250  has been distributed in respect of each common unit and general partner unit of eqm for that quarter the company is the ultimate parent company of eqgp and eqm 

  

key events in 2015   

  

during 2015  eqt achieved record annual production sales volumes including a 27  increase in total sales volumes and a 34  increase in marcellus sales volumes however the average realized price to eqt corporation for production sales volumes decreased 36  from 416  per mcfe in 2014  to 267  per mcfe in 2015  eqt’s midstream business delivered record gathered volumes that were 28  higher than the previous year during 2015  eqm reported net income of 3935 million  1270 million  higher than 2014  the increase was primarily related to higher operating income driven by production development in the marcellus shale by eqt and third parties eqt and its consolidated subsidiaries also completed the following transactions and other events that were instrumental in contributing to a successful 2015

eqt production business segment 

  

eqt production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the appalachian basin with 100  tcfe of proved natural gas ngl and crude oil reserves across approximately 34 million  gross acres including approximately 630000  gross acres in the marcellus play as of december 31 2015  eqt believes that it is a technology leader in extended lateral horizontal and completion drilling in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology eqt production’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves eqt’s proved reserves decreased 7  in 2015  primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices the company’s marcellus assets constitute approximately 78  tcfe of the companys total proved reserves 

the following illustration depicts eqt’s acreage position within the marcellus play as of december 31 2015 

as of december 31 2015  the company’s proved reserves were as follows 



  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2015  the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by calendar year 2015  produced volumes is 16  years 

the company invested approximately 1670 million  on well development during 2015  with total production sales volumes hitting a record high of 6031  bcfe an increase of 27  over the previous year capital spending for eqt production is expected to be approximately 820 million  in 2016  excluding business development and land acquisitions the majority of which will be used to support the drilling of approximately 77  gross wells including 72  marcellus wells and 5  deep utica wells during the past three years the company’s number of wells drilled spud and related capital expenditures for well development were 



  

  includes upper devonian formations 

eqt midstream business segment 

  

the company believes that the current footprint of its midstream assets which are primarily owned by eqm and span a wide area of the marcellus and utica shales in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia is a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the company for growth eqt midstream is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in the region such as the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia 

in january 2012 the company formed eqm a publicly traded limited partnership to own operate acquire and develop midstream assets in the appalachian basin eqm provides midstream services to the company and third parties through its two  primary assets eqm’s transmission and storage system and eqm’s gathering system 

due to the companys ownership and control of eqgp and eqm the results of eqgp and eqm are both consolidated in the company’s financial statements unless otherwise noted discussions of eqt midstream’s business operations and results in this annual report on form 10k include eqgps and eqm’s business operations and results the company records the noncontrolling interests of the public limited partners of eqgp and eqm in its financial statements 

  

eqt midstream’s gathering system includes approximately 8250  miles of gathering lines including 1500  miles of fercregulated low pressure gathering lines owned by eqm and 185 miles of high pressure gathering lines not subject to federal rate regulation owned by eqm the lefthand map on page 12 depicts the company’s gathering lines and compressor stations in relationship to the marcellus shale formation as of december 31 2015  the companys marcellus gathering capacity was approximately 2000  mmcf per day consisting of approximately 1405  mmcf per day in pennsylvania and approximately 595  mmcf per day in west virginia 

eqt midstream’s transmission and storage system includes approximately 900  miles of fercregulated interstate pipeline that connects to seven  interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies the interstate pipeline system includes approximately 700  miles of pipe owned by equitrans lp equitrans an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of eqm eqt midstream’s transmission and storage system also includes an approximately 200 mile pipeline referred to as the allegheny valley connector avc which was acquired by the company in december 2013 in connection with the equitable gas transaction as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the transmission and storage system is supported by eighteen  natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 660  mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 47  bcf of working gas capacity fourteen  of these reservoirs representing approximately 400  mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 32  bcf of working gas capacity are owned by eqm the storage reservoirs are clustered in two  geographic areas connected to eqm’s transmission and storage system with ten  in southwestern pennsylvania and eight  in northern west virginia the avc facilities which include four  storage reservoirs are owned by the company and operated by eqm under a lease between eqm and an affiliate of the company 

  

the righthand map on page 12 depicts the company’s transmission lines storage pools and compressor stations in relationship to the marcellus shale formation eqt midstreams yearend total transmission capacity was approximately 3550 mmcf per day eqt midstream primarily through eqm began several multiyear transmission capacity expansion projects in 2015 to support the continued growth of the marcellus and the developing deep utica play including the ovc which is currently under construction eqm is also evaluating several projects that could total an additional 15 bcf per day of capacity by yearend 2018 the projects may include additional compression pipeline looping and new header pipelines 

eqt midstream also has a gas marketing affiliate eqt energy llc eqt energy that provides optimization of capacity and storage assets through its ngl and natural gas sales to marketers utilities and industrial customers within eqts operational footprint eqt energy also provides marketing services and manages approximately 1740000  dth per day of thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity for the benefit of eqt production and has committed to an additional 520000  dth per day of thirdparty contractual capacity expected to come online in future periods eqt energy currently leases 37  bcf of storagerelated assets from third parties 

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure and despite a reduced capital budget in 2015 that is reflective of the current price environment profitably developing its undeveloped reserves and effectively and efficiently utilizing its extensive gathering and transmission assets that are uniquely positioned across the marcellus and utica shales and in close proximity to the northeastern united states markets 

eqt believes that it is a technology leader in extendedlateral horizontal drilling and completion in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology substantially all of the company’s acreage is held by production or in fee therefore eqt production is able to develop its acreage in the most economical manner through the use of longer laterals and multiwell pads as opposed to being required to drill lesseconomical wells in order to retain acreage the use of multiwell pads in conjunction with a completion technique known as reduced cluster spacing has the additional benefit of reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the company’s drilling operations 

  

eqt also believes that its midstream assets are strategically located in the marcellus and utica shale regions – spanning a large prolific area of southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia – providing a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the company for continued growth eqt midstream primarily through eqm intends to capitalize on the growing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in this region and in particular the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia in order to meet this growing need eqm has been focusing on a number of gathering and transmission projects including the following 

 

   

the ongoing efforts of eqgp and eqm are an important support mechanism for eqt’s overall business strategy through capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities attracting additional thirdparty volumes and pursuing accretive acquisitions from the company eqm is expected to grow profitably and provide an ongoing source of capital to the company

markets and customers 

  

natural gas sales  the company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian basin and the northeastern united states the company’s current transportation portfolio also enables the company to reach markets along the gulf coast and midwestern portions of the united states natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company typically receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to the price at henry hub located in louisiana the location for pricing nymex natural gas futures as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the northeast region in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production most of which is hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth in “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas in mid2011 eqt opened a publicaccess natural gas fueling station in pittsburgh pennsylvania and with the growing demand for compressed natural gas for numerous fleets throughout the region the station underwent an expansion in 2013 adding two more dispensers in conjunction with this project the company is promoting the use of natural gas with its own fleet vehicles and plans to operate 14 of its lightduty vehicle fleet more than 175 vehicles on natural gas by the end of 2016 in addition all of the companys contracted drilling rigs and completion crews utilize natural gas 

ngl sales   the company sells ngls from its own production through the eqt production segment and from gas marketed for third parties by eqt midstream in its appalachian operations the company contracts with markwest energy partners lp markwest a wholly owned subsidiary of mplx lp to process natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas ngls are recovered at the processing plants and transported to a fractionation plant owned by markwest for separation into commercial components markwest markets these components for a fee the company also has contractual processing arrangements in its permian basin operations whereby the company sells gas to thirdparty processors at a weighted average liquids component price 

the following table presents the average sales price on an average per mcfe basis to eqt corporation for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without cash settled derivatives for the years ended december 31 



  

in addition price information for all products is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “consolidated operational data” and incorporated herein by reference 

  

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to four major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company dominion transmission and tennessee gas pipeline company the gathering system also maintains interconnections with eqm’s transmission and storage system 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2015  totaled 7543  tbtu of which approximately 89  related to gathering for eqt production and other affiliates revenues from eqt production and other affiliates accounted for approximately 92 of 2015  gathering revenues 

  

natural gas transmission and storage natural gas transmission and storage operations are executed using transmission and underground storage facilities owned by the company customers of eqt midstream’s gas transmission and storage services are affiliates and third parties primarily in the northeastern united states 

  

as of december 31 2015  the weighted average remaining contract life based on total projected contracted revenues for eqm’s firm transmission and storage contracts including contracts on the avc and contracts associated with expected future capacity from eqm expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which eqm has entered into firm agreements was approximately 17 years in 2015  approximately 61 of transportation volumes and 53 of transmission revenues were from affiliates 

  

natural gas marketing   eqt energy provides marketing services and thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of eqt production eqt energy also engages in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of eqt production the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices eqt energy leases thirdparty storage capacity in order to take advantage of seasonal spreads where available through the eqt midstream segment 

one  customer within the eqt production segment accounted for approximately 10  12  and 11  of eqt production’s total operating revenues in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the company does not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the company’s natural gas are available 

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production transportation and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators competition for natural gas gathering transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates and other commercial terms customer commitment levels timing performance reliability service levels location reputation and fuel efficiencies key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines key competitors for gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies eqt competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and ngls some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers 

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing the company’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties kentucky ohio virginia and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia the company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus and upper devonian acreage in 2013 the pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases and texas permits similar joint development in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and texas sets production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

  

eqt midstream’s transmission and gathering operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations and transmission facilities these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

  

the interstate natural gas transmission systems and storage operations of eqt midstream are regulated by the ferc and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the ferc for instance the ferc approves tariffs that establish eqm’s rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service to eqm’s customers the fees or rates established under eqm’s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority over transmission operations also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

in 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation as of the filing date of this annual report the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other cftc rules that may be 

relevant to the company have yet to be finalized because significant cftc rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company has experienced increased and expects additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

  

regulators periodically review or audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the us congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the company 

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing including drilling operating and abandoning wells pipelines and related facilities 

  

the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations the company conducts baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of our drilling pads legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of expenditures related to environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation the epa and various states have issued a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 

  

employees 

  

the company and its subsidiaries had 1914 employees at the end of 2015  and none are subject to a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas ngl and oil price volatility or a prolonged period of low natural gas ngl and oil prices may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth liquidity and financial position depend upon the prices for natural gas ngls and oil the prices for natural gas ngls and oil have historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue in the future the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions and seasonal trends the supply of and demand for natural gas ngls and oil regional basis differentials national and worldwide economic and political conditions the ability to export liquefied natural gas the effect of energy conservation efforts the price and availability of alternative fuels the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil were depressed throughout 2015 and the early part of 2016 the average daily prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 323  per mmbtu to a low of 176  per mmbtu from january 1 2015 through february 10 2016 and the average daily prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 6143  per barrel to a low of 2655  per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian basis ngls and oil and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations however we do expect natural gas and ngl prices particularly in the appalachian basin to remain depressed during 2016 

recent decreases in natural gas ngl and oil prices have resulted in lower revenues operating income and cash flows prolonged low andor significant or extended further declines in natural gas ngl and oil prices may result in further decreases in our revenues operating income and cash flows which may result in further reductions in drilling activity delays in the construction of new midstream infrastructure and downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit ratings further declines in prices could also adversely affect the amount of natural gas ngls and oil that we can produce economically which may result in the company having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our oil and gas and certain midstream properties and could cause us to incur additional noncash impairment charges to earnings in future periods see “impairment of oil and gas properties” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “recent natural gas ngl and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore oil and gas properties future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods” below moreover a failure to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngl and oil prices could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value 

increases in natural gas ngl and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas   

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the operations for drilling producing transporting and storing natural gas ngls and oil such as well site blowouts cratering and explosions pipe and other equipment and system failures uncontrolled flows of natural gas or well fluids fires formations with abnormal pressures pollution and 

environmental risks and natural disasters we also face various threats to the security of our or third parties’ facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants compressor stations and pipelines these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment pollution or other environmental damage disruptions to our operations regulatory investigations and penalties and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

our failure to develop obtain access or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas ngls and oil to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of natural gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities the capacity of transmission gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas ngls and oil competition for pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could affect our competitive position the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure primarily through eqm is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transmission pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions natural gas ngl and oil price volatility delays in obtaining permits and other government approvals title and property access problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors moreover if our infrastructure development and maintenance programs are not successfully developed on time and within budget we may not be able to profitably fulfill our contractual obligations to third parties including joint venture partners 

we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty natural gas ngl and oil transmission gathering processing and storage facilities that are limited in number geographically concentrated and subject to the same risks identified above with respect to our infrastructure development and maintenance programs because we do not own these thirdparty pipelines or facilities their continuing operation is not within our control an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil in such an event we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor sell our production at prices lower than market prices or at prices lower than we currently project in addition some of our thirdparty contracts involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part moreover our usage of third parties for transmission gathering and processing services subjects us to the credit and performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market 

also our producing properties and operations are primarily in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas as a result we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production caused by transportation capacity constraints curtailment of production availability of equipment facilities personnel or services significant governmental regulation natural disasters adverse weather conditions plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of natural gas and ngls produced from this area 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2016 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development reserve acquisitions exploratory activities midstream infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital    notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2016 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies including the appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2016 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals and our ability to achieve benefits anticipated to result from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering and transmission systems and pipelines our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas resources 

our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units setbacks the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties some states allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration as well as joint development of existing contiguous leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling and pipeline construction environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety including replacement requirements and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business or result in delays due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed governmental approvals and permits these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transmission and storage businesses are in many cases subject to federal regulation by the ferc which may prohibit us from realizing a level of return that we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of lower overall rates imputed revenue credits cost disallowances andor expense deferrals certain natural gas gathering facilities are exempted from regulation by the ferc we believe that many of our natural gas facilities meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipelines status as an exempt gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company although the ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to the jurisdictional status of those facilities however the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation within the industry so the classification and regulation of some of our facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or the us congress failure to comply with applicable provisions of the laws governing the regulation and safety of natural gas gathering transmission and storage facilities as well as with the regulations rules orders restrictions and conditions associated with these laws could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties of up to 200000 per day for each violation up to a maximum penalty of 2000000 for a related series of violations 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming in addition to periodic changes to air water and waste laws as well as recent epa initiatives to impose climate changebased air regulations on the industry the us congress and various states have been evaluating and in certain cases have enacted climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would 

further restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

another area of regulation is hydraulic fracturing which we utilize to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation or regulation has been proposed or is under discussion at federal state and local levels for instance legislation or regulation banning hydraulic fracturing has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions in which we do not have drilling operations we cannot predict whether any other such federal state or local legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how it may affect our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs result in delays in production or delivery of natural gas or perhaps even preclude us from drilling wells 

  

recent discussions regarding the federal budget have included proposals that could potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal and collaterally state income taxes of independent producers with the potential repeal of the ability to expense intangible drilling costs having the most significant potential future impact to us these changes if enacted will make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our natural gas resources 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

in 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation as of the filing date of this annual report the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including us such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other rules that may be relevant to us or our counterparties have yet to be finalized because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on our hedging program including available counterparties or regulatory compliance obligations we have experienced increased and anticipate additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

  

we and eqm rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including access to capital markets and changes in the terms of and cost of capital including increases in interest rates may adversely affect our or eqms business and financial condition our and eqms ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we or eqm desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our or eqms flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions or our ability to implement our business strategies adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas ngls and oil which could have a negative impact on our and eqms revenues and credit ratings 

  

as of february 10 2016 our longterm debt was rated “baa3” by moody’s investors services moody’s “bbb” by standard  poor’s ratings service sp and “bbb” by fitch ratings service fitch and eqms longterm debt was rated ba1 by moodys bbb by sp and bbb by fitch although we are not aware of any current plans of moody’s sp or fitch to lower their respective ratings on our or eqms debt we cannot be assured that our or eqms credit ratings will not be downgraded or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency on december 16 2015 moodys announced that it had placed 29 us exploration and production companies including the company under review for a downgrade due to the low commodity price environment on january 25 2016 moody’s also announced that it had placed three midstream partnerships including eqm under review for a downgrade primarily due to their affiliations with sponsoring exploration and production companies low prices for natural gas ngls and oil or an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our or eqms debt if moody’s or another credit rating agency downgrades the ratings particularly below investment grade our or eqm’s access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits on our 

derivatives would increase we may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of pipeline capacity contracts the amount of which may be substantial or we or eqm may be required to provide additional credit assurances related to joint venture arrangements or construction contracts which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity investment grade refers to the quality of a company’s credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies in order to be considered investment grade the company must be rated “bbb“ or higher by sp “baa3” or higher by moody’s and “bbb“ or higher by fitch 

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things oil spills the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing and pipeline projects may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

cyber incidents may adversely impact our operations 

  

our business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications to operate our production and midstream businesses and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our systems or infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas ngls and oil difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents 

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a well is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the natural gas ngls and oil to market moreover an incorrect determination of legal title to our wells could result in liability to the owner of the natural gas or oil rights and an impairment to our assets successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect for example seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas or other hydrocarbons certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful this failure could adversely affect our business results of operations or liquidity because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

recent natural gas ngl and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore oil and gas properties future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties generally on a fieldbyfield basis for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the company’s management for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil future operating costs and inflation commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality basis and inflation proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

our estimate of the fair value of our assets depends on the prices of natural gas ngls and oil primarily as a result of declines in the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices during 2015 we recorded noncash pretax impairment charges of 943 million  and 1052 million  to our proved oil and gas properties in the noncore permian basin during 2015 and 2014 respectively further declines in natural gas ngl or oil prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance among other things may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves andor could result in additional noncash impairment charges to writedown the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods see “impairment of oil and gas properties” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

the amount and timing of actual future natural gas ngl and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngl and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas ngls and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

we also rely on third parties for certain construction drilling and completion services materials and supplies delays or failures to perform by such third parties could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngl and oil reserves 

  

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas ngls and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil the amount timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngl and oil industry in general 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs some of which are beyond our control these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

principal facilities are owned or in the case of certain office locations warehouse buildings and equipment leased by the company’s business segments the majority of the company’s properties are located on or under i private properties owned in fee held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles or ii public highways under franchises or permits from various governmental authorities the company’s facilities are generally well maintained and where appropriate are replaced or expanded to meet operating requirements 

  

eqt production   eqt production’s properties are located primarily in pennsylvania west virginia kentucky and virginia this segment has approximately 34 million  gross acres approximately 72  of which are considered undeveloped which encompass substantially all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil producing properties approximately 630000  of these gross acres are located in the marcellus play although most of its wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths  2000  to 8000  feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2015  the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 100  tcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 58  tcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 05  tcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 37  tcfe substantially all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations 

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngl and oil reserves is prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for preparing the reserve report and the technical aspects of the reserves audit received a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has 18 years  of experience in the oil and gas industry to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally division of interest and production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve reconciliation between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngl and oil reserves is audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp ryder scott which is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally in the course of its audit ryder scott reviewed 100  of the total net natural gas ngl and oil proved reserves attributable to the company’s interests as of december 31 2015  ryder scott conducted a detailed well by well audit of the company’s largest properties this audit covered 80  of the company’s proved developed reserves ryder scott’s audit of the remaining approximately 20  of the company’s proved developed properties consisted of an audit of aggregated groups not exceeding 200  wells per case for operated wells and 230  wells per case for nonoperated wells for undeveloped locations the company determined and ryder scott reviewed and approved the areas within the company’s acreage considered to be proven for undeveloped locations reserves were assigned and projected by the company’s reserves engineers for locations within these proven areas and approved by ryder scott based on analogous type curves and offset production information ryder scott’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 99 

  

no  report has been filed with any federal authority or agency reflecting a 5  or more difference from the company’s estimated total reserves additional information relating to the company’s estimates of natural gas ngl and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows is provided in note 22 unaudited to the consolidated financial statements 

in 2015  the company commenced drilling operations spud or drilled on 157  gross horizontal wells with an aggregate of approximately 868000  feet of pay in the marcellus including upper devonian play total proved reserves in the marcellus play decreased 6  to 78  tcfe in 2015  primarily as a result of the company’s decision to reduce the scale of its fiveyear development plan and associated proved undeveloped reserves in response to a reduction in commodity prices total proved reserves in the huron play decreased approximately 10  to 11  tcfe due to the companys decision to cease development in this play production sales volumes in 2015  from the marcellus including the upper devonian play was 5051  bcfe over the past four  years the company has experienced a 99  developmental drilling success rate 

natural gas ngls and crude oil pricing 



  

ngls and crude oil were converted to mcfe at the rate of six  mcfe per barrel for all periods 

  

for additional information on pricing see “consolidated operational data” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

the company’s average per unit production cost excluding production taxes of natural gas ngls and oil during 2015  2014  and 2013  was 012  per mcfe 014  per mcfe and 015  per mcfe respectively at december 31 2015  the company had approximately 50  multiple completion wells 



  

summary of proved natural gas oil and ngl reserves as of december 31 2015  based on average fiscal year prices 





as of december 31 2015 the company had no proved undeveloped reserves that remained undeveloped for more than five years 

certain lease and acquisition agreements require the company to drill a specific number of wells in 2016  within the marcellus formation the company is required to drill one  well in 2016  which the company intends to accomplish either directly through its 2016  development program or indirectly by contracting with a third party to do so including through an assignment of the lease farmout or other arrangement 

as of december 31 2015  leases associated with approximately 34147  gross undeveloped acres expire in 2016  if they are not renewed this acreage is in addition to the acreage that may be lost if drilling obligations are not met the company has an active lease renewal program in areas targeted for development

a all production information related to natural gas is reported net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of ngls 

b other includes ohio virginia maryland and texas 

the company sells natural gas primarily within the appalachian basin under a variety of contractual agreements some of which specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities the company expects to fulfill these delivery commitments with existing proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2015  the company’s delivery commitments through 2020  were as follows 



capital expenditures at eqt production totaled 1852 million  during 2015 including 182 million  for the acquisition of properties the company invested approximately 1381 million during 2015 developing proved reserves and approximately 289 million on wells still in progress at year end during the year ended december 31 2015 the company converted 1527 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves the company had additions to proved developed reserves of 544 bcfe the majority of which were from wells spud that had not previously been classified as proved proved undeveloped reserves had negative revisions of 2353 bcfe in 2015 due primarily to the removal of uneconomic locations and the removal of locations that were no longer expected to be drilled within 5 years this decrease was partially offset by the addition of 1665 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves these extensions and discoveries were mainly due to the addition of proved locations in the company’s pennsylvania and west virginia marcellus play along with 337 bcfe attributed to lateral length extensions of proved undeveloped locations booked in 2014 as of december 31 2015  the company’s proved undeveloped reserves totaled 37  tcfe 100  of which is associated with the development of the marcellus including upper devonian play all proved undeveloped drilling locations are expected to be drilled within five  years 

  

the company’s 2015  extensions discoveries and other additions totaled 2051  bcfe which exceeded the 2015  production of 619  bcfe of these reserves 1328 bcfe are attributed to the addition of proved undeveloped locations in the company’s pennsylvania and west virginia marcellus fields 386 bcfe are from the development of locations not previously booked as proved and 337 bcfe are due to the extension of lateral lengths associated with existing proved undeveloped locations 

  

wells located in pennsylvania are primarily in marcellus formations with depths ranging from 5000  feet to 8000  feet wells located in west virginia are primarily in marcellus and huron formations with depths ranging from 2500  feet to 6500  feet wells located in kentucky are primarily in huron formations with depths ranging from 2500  feet to 6000  feet wells located in other areas are in cbm utica and permian formations with depths ranging from 2000  feet to 13500  feet

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company 

environmental proceedings 

  

in june and august 2012 the company received three notices of violation novs from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the padep the novs alleged violations of the pennsylvania oil and gas act and clean streams law in connection with the unintentional release in may 2012 by a company vendor of water from an impaired water pit at a company well location in tioga county pennsylvania since confirming a release the company has cooperated with the padep in remediating the affected areas 

  

during the second quarter of 2014 the company received a proposed consent assessment of civil penalty from the padep that proposed a civil penalty related to the novs the company was unable to resolve the padep claims due to the agency’s interpretation of the penalty provisions of the clean streams law accordingly on september 19 2014 the company filed a declaratory judgment action in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania against the padep seeking a court ruling on the legal interpretation the commonwealth court upheld the padep’s preliminary objections to the company’s complaint and the company appealed that decision to the pennsylvania supreme court on october 7 2014 the padep filed a complaint against the company before the pennsylvania environmental hearing board seeking 453 million in civil penalties on december 29 2015 the pennsylvania supreme court reversed the commonwealth court and reinstated the company’s declaratory judgment in the commonwealth court the company believes the padep’s penalty assessment is legally flawed and unsupportable under the clean streams law while the company expects the padep’s claims to result in penalties that exceed 100000 the company expects the resolution of these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material impact on the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company 

the company has received a number of other novs from environmental agencies in some of the states in which the company operates alleging various violations of oil and gas air water and waste regulations the company has responded to these novs and has where applicable substantially corrected or remediated the areas in question the company disputes a number of the alleged novs and cannot predict with certainty whether any or all of these novs will result in penalties if penalties are imposed an individual penalty or the aggregate of these penalties could result in monetary sanctions in excess of 100000

consolidated results of continuing operations 

  

2015  eqt overview 

• annual production sales volumes of 6031  bcfe 27  higher than 2014   

• marcellus sales volumes of 5051  bcfe 34  higher than 2014   

• gathered volumes of 7543  tbtu 28  higher than 2014   

• the company completed eqgps ipo 

• eqm completed two underwritten public offerings of common units representing limited partner interests 

income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2015  was 852 million  056  per diluted share compared with 3856 million  253  per diluted share in 2014  the 3004 million  decrease in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to a 36  decrease in the average realized price to eqt corporation for production sales volumes higher operating expenses and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of eqm and eqgp partially offset by a 27  increase in production sales volumes increased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges increased gathering and transmission revenues and lower income tax expense operating expenses for 2015 and 2014 include 1225 million  and 2673 million  respectively of pretax noncash impairment charges related to the companys oil and gas properties which are included in the impairment of longlived assets in the statements of consolidated income 

the average realized price to eqt corporation for production sales volumes was 267  per mcfe for 2015  compared to 416  per mcfe for 2014  the decrease in the average realized price was driven by lower nymex natural gas prices net of cash settled derivatives lower ngl prices and a lower average differential which includes appalachian basin basis recoveries and cash settled basis swaps recoveries represent differences in natural gas prices between the appalachian basin and other markets reached by utilizing transportation capacity differences in natural gas prices between appalachian basin and fixed price sales contracts term sales with fixed differentials to nymex and other marketing activity including capacity releases 

the companys volume weighted average nymex natural gas index price was 266  per mmbtu for 2015  39  lower than the average index price of 438  per mmbtu in 2014  in addition the average differential decreased by 015  per mcf primarily due to lower appalachian basin basis the companys average ngl price was 1884 per barrel for 2015  compared to 4194 per barrel for 2014  

operating income was 5631 million  in 2015 compared to 8534 million  in 2014 a decrease of 2903 million  eqt midstreams operating income increased by 891 million  in 2015 primarily due to increases in gathering and transmission revenues as a result of production development in the marcellus shale which was more than offset by a 4011 million  decrease in eqt productions operating income in 2015 the average realized price to eqt production decreased to 174  per mcfe in 2015 compared to 323  per mcfe in 2014 the decrease in the average realized price to eqt production was offset by an increase in sales volumes of 27  primarily as a result of increased production from the 2014 and 2013 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells eqt production total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  also included 3851 million  of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments compared to 838 million  of derivative gains not designated as hedges and 248 million  of gains for ineffectiveness of financial hedges for the year ended december 31 2014  the increased derivative gains for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily related to favorable changes in the fair market value of eqt productions nymex swaps due to decreased forward nymex prices during the year ended december 31 2015  eqt production received 1703 million  and 365 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively these net cash settlements are included in the average realized price discussion 

operating expenses for 2015 were 17766 million  compared to 16505 million  in 2014 an increase of 1261 million  this increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense higher transportation and processing expenses and higher exploration costs partially offset by a favorable depletion rate and a decrease in the impairment of longlived assets 

income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2014  was 3856 million  253  per diluted share compared with 2987 million  197  per diluted share in 2013  the 869 million  increase in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to a 26  increase in production sales volumes favorable gains on derivatives not designated as hedges increases in contracted transmission capacity and throughput and gathered volumes favorable changes in hedging ineffectiveness and lower interest expense these factors were partially offset by impairments of longlived assets higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of eqm higher transportation and processing expenses higher income tax expense higher selling general and administrative sga expense and higher dda expense 

operating income was 8534 million  in 2014  compared to 6546 million  in 2013  an increase of 1988 million  eqt production sales volumes increased 26  primarily as a result of increased production from the 2014 and 2013 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the average realized price to eqt production for sales volumes was 323  per mcfe in 2014  compared to 315  per mcfe in 2013  eqt production total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  included 838 million  of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments compared to 03 million  of derivative losses for the year ended december 31 2013 for the year ended december 31 2014  eqt production received 365 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges which is included in the average realized price to eqt production of 323  per mcfe in 2014  the year ended december 31 2014  also included a 248 million  gain for hedging ineffectiveness of financial hedges compared to a 213 million  loss for ineffectiveness of financial hedges for the year ended december 31 2013 

transmission operating revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 reflecting continued production development in the marcellus shale by affiliate and thirdparty producers the increase primarily resulted from higher firm transmission contracted capacity and throughput for third parties and eqt production and higher interruptible transmission service gathering revenues increased primarily as a result of higher affiliate volumes gathered in 2014 compared to 2013 driven by production development in the marcellus shale eqt midstream significantly increased firm reservation fee revenues in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of increased capacity under firm contracts with affiliates the decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to affiliates contracting for additional firm capacity 

operating expenses for 2014  were 16505 million  compared to 12270 million  in 2013  an increase of 4235 million  excluding a 2673 million  impairment charge and 262 million increase in depreciation and depletion operating expenses increased 1300 million this increase was primarily attributable to higher transportation and processing expenses and higher sga costs consistent with the growth in the production and midstream businesses

eqt production adjusted net operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the company’s management to evaluate periodoverperiod comparisons of earnings trends eqt production adjusted net operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and is net of transportation and processing costs management utilizes eqt production adjusted net operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not burden the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement eqt production adjusted net operating revenues also reflects transportation and processing costs as deductions from operating revenues because management considers the net price realized for sales of products after the costs of processing and transporting the product to sales points to be an indicator of the quality of earnings periodoverperiod management also considers this to be an indicator of how well the company is utilizing its transportation and processing contracts the sale price for natural gas is significantly impacted by the market in which the gas is sold and the expense incurred to transport and process the gas is important in evaluating the quality of earnings periodoverperiod because the cost of reaching a higher priced market may exceed the incremental price benefit of that market as compared to the market where the gas is produced this is particularly important to natural gas producers in the appalachian basin given pipeline constraints and the impact on pricing in the area management further believes that eqt production adjusted net operating revenues as presented provides useful information for investors for evaluating periodoverperiod earnings and is consistent with industry practices 



business segment results of operations

eqt production’s operating income totaled 1049 million  for 2015  compared to 5060 million  for 2014  the 4011 million  decrease in operating income was primarily due to a lower average realized price to eqt production and increased operating expenses partially offset by increased sales of produced natural gas and increased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges operating expenses included noncash impairment charges of 1183 million  in 2015 and 2673 million  in 2014 the 2015 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the permian basin of texas of 943 million  and impairments of proved properties in the utica shale of ohio of 43 million  as well as 197 million  for unproved property impairments of noncore marcellus acreage related to lease expirations the 2014 impairment charge consisted of impairments of proved properties in the permian basin of texas of 1052 million  and impairments of proved properties in the utica shale of ohio of 755 million  as well as impairments of 866 million  associated with undeveloped properties the proved properties impairments in 2015 and 2014 were a result of continued declines in commodity prices and insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development the 2015 and 2014 impairments related to the unproved properties were due to operational decisions to focus nearterm development activities in the companys core marcellus and deep utica acreage 

total operating revenues were 15409 million  for 2015  compared to 18133 million  for 2014  the 2724 million  decrease in total operating revenues was primarily due to a 46  decrease in the average realized price to eqt production and a prior year gain on hedge ineffectiveness partly offset by a 27  increase in production sales volumes and increased gains on derivatives not designated as hedges in 2015 

the 149  per mcfe decrease in the average realized price to eqt production for the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily due to the decrease in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives of 106 per mcf lower ngl prices and a decrease in the average natural gas differential of 015  per mcf the average differential for 2015 includes lower appalachian basin basis of 011  per mcf recoveries per mcf also included in the average differential for the year ended december 31 2015 were consistent with the year ended december 31 2014 recoveries represent differences in natural gas prices between the appalachian basin and other markets reached by utilizing transportation capacity differences in natural gas prices between appalachian basin and fixed price sales contracts term sales with fixed differentials to nymex and other marketing activity including capacity releases favorable recoveries in 2015 from fixed price sales contracts were offset by reduced differentials between the appalachian basin and ultimate sales prices 

the increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2013 and 2014 drilling programs in the marcellus play this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells 

eqt production total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  included a 3851 million  gain on derivatives not designated as hedges compared to an 838 million  gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31 2014  the increased gains for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily related to favorable changes in the fair market value of eqt production’s nymex swaps due to a decrease in forward nymex prices during the year ended december 31 2015 eqt production received 1703 million  and 365 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively these net cash settlements are included in the average realized price discussion for the year ended december 31 2014 eqt production total operating revenues also included a 248 million  gain for hedging ineffectiveness 

  

operating expenses totaled 14360 million  for 2015  compared to 13347 million  for 2014  the increase in operating expenses was the result of increases in dda transportation and processing exploration sga and loe expenses partly offset by decreases in noncash impairments of longlived assets and production taxes the increase in dda expense was the result of higher produced volumes partly offset by a lower overall depletion rate in 2015 transportation and processing expenses increased by 738 million  due to additional contracted capacity to move eqt production’s natural gas out of the appalachian basin and increased liquids processing fees transportation and processing expenses are included in the average realized price to eqt production exploration expense increased 403 million  due to increased lease expirations of noncore acreage totaling 228 million and expenses related to exploratory wells the increase in sga expense was primarily due to higher personnel costs of 147 million including incentive compensation expenses and 112 million of drilling program reduction charges including rig release penalties partly offset by 42 million of higher litigation and environmental remediation costs in the prior year a 26 million decrease in professional services costs and a 24 million reduction to the reserve for uncollectible accounts the increase in loe was primarily due to increased marcellus activity including a 14 million increase in salt water disposal costs and increased permian maintenance costs production taxes decreased primarily due to a 167 million decrease in severance taxes due to lower market sales prices partly offset by higher production sales volumes in certain jurisdictions subject to these taxes and a 36 million increase in property taxes production taxes also decreased due to a 14 million decrease in the pennsylvania impact fee primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of wells drilled in pennsylvania in 2015 

year ended december 31 2014  vs december 31 2013   

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 5060 million  for 2014  compared to 3712 million  for 2013  the 1348 million  increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales of produced natural gas and ngls and a higher average realized price partially offset by an increase in operating expenses which included 2673 million  of noncash impairment charges impairment charges consisted of 1052 million  associated with proved properties in the permian basin of texas related to the 2014 decline in commodity prices impairment charges also included 866 million associated with undeveloped properties and 755 million associated with proved properties in the utica shale of ohio as a result of insufficient recovery of hydrocarbons to support continued development along with the decline in commodity prices 

  

total operating revenues were 18133 million  for 2014  compared to 13109 million  for 2013  the 5024 million  increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to a 26  increase in production sales volumes a favorable gain on derivatives not designated as hedges a favorable change in hedging ineffectiveness and a 3 increase in the average realized price to eqt production the increase in production sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2014 and 2013 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus play this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells 

total operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 included a 248 million gain for hedging ineffectiveness of financial hedges compared to a 213 million loss for ineffectiveness of financial hedges for the year ended december 31 2013 the year ended december 31 2014 also included 838 million of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments compared to 03 million of derivative losses for the year ended december 31 2013 the gains for the year ended december 31 2014 related to favorable changes in the fair market value of basis swaps and nymex collars that were not designated as hedging instruments due to decreased forward nymex and basis prices as of december 31 2014 eqt production received 365 million  of net cash settlements for derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december 31 2014 these net cash settlements are included in the average realized price 

the 008 per mcfe increase in the average realized price to eqt production was the net result of an increase in the average nymex natural gas price net of cash settled derivatives combined with a per unit decrease in midstream revenue deductions partly offset by a lower average natural gas differential of 040 per mcf the average differential included lower appalachian basin basis of 091 per mcf favorable recoveries of 045 per mcf and favorable settlements of basis swaps of 006 per mcf for the year ended december 31 2014 eqt production recognized higher recoveries compared to 2013 primarily by using its contracted transportation capacity to sell gas in higher priced markets particularly during the winter months when market prices in the united states northeast region were significantly higher than the appalachian basin prices much of these higher revenues resulted from sales of the company’s texas eastern transmission tetco and tennessee gas pipeline capacity including additional tetco capacity that came online in 2014 effective february 2014 the company acquired new tetco capacity of 245000 mmbtu per day that enabled the company to reach markets in eastern pennsylvania effective november 2014 additional tetco capacity of 300000 mmbtu per day came online that enabled the company to reach markets in new jersey as well as markets along the gulf coast additionally the company executed natural gas sales with fixed differentials to nymex for the 2014 summer term during the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014 when market prices were favorable compared to actual appalachian basin basis during the summer of 2014 

  

operating expenses totaled 13347 million  for 2014  compared to 9397 million  for 2013 the increase in operating expenses was the result of impairments of longlived assets of 2673 million as previously mentioned and increases in sga production taxes dda loe and exploration expenses sga expense increased in 2014 primarily as a result of higher personnel costs of 124 million including incentive compensation expenses higher litigation and environmental reserves of 62 million and an increase in professional services of 49 million production taxes increased due to an 116 million increase in severance taxes and property taxes as a result of higher market sales prices and higher production sales volumes in certain jurisdictions subject to these taxes production taxes also increased due to a 51 million increase in the pennsylvania impact fee primarily as a result of an increase in the number of wells drilled in pennsylvania in 2014 depletion expense increased as a result of higher production sales volumes in 2014 partially offset by a lower overall depletion rate the increase in loe was mainly a result of increased marcellus activity in 2014 including a 28 million increase in salt water disposal expenses and a 27 million increase in labor expenses along with expenses related to the exchange of properties with range exploration expense increased in 2014 primarily as a result of increased geophysical activity compared to 2013 

in connection with an asset exchange with range in 2014 the company received acreage and producing wells in the permian basin of texas in exchange for acreage producing wells the company’s 50 ownership interest in a supporting gathering system in the nora fields of virginia and cash of 1673 million in conjunction with the transaction eqt production recognized a pretax gain of 274 million in 2014 which is included in gain on sale  exchange of assets in the statements of consolidated income

income taxes 



income tax expense decreased 1094 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of lower pretax income and a realized 354 million tax benefit in connection with recent internal revenue service irs guidance received by the company in connection with the company’s sale of equitable gas in 2013 discussed below these benefits were partially offset by an increase in expense of 795 million primarily related to valuation allowances recorded on pennsylvania state net operating loss nol carryforwards during the period the company’s effective income tax rate decreased to 245  in 2015 from 296  in 2014 the decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2014 is primarily attributable to an increase in earnings allocated to noncontrolling limited partners of eqgp and eqm the effects of the irs guidance a decrease in eqt production’s operating income increased tax credits in 2015 and a decrease in state taxes in 2015 as a result of lower pretax income on state income tax paying entities these items were significantly offset by the valuation allowance recorded primarily on pennsylvania state nols the overall rate was lower for both periods as the company consolidates 100 of the pretax income related to the noncontrolling public limited partners’ share of eqgp earnings but is not required to record an income tax provision with respect to the portion of the earnings allocated to eqm and eqgp noncontrolling public limited partners earnings allocated to the eqm and eqgp noncontrolling public limited partners increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of higher net income at eqm and increased noncontrolling interests as a result of eqm’s march and november 2015 public offerings of common units issuances of eqm common units under the 750 million atm program and eqgp’s ipo 

during 2015 the company realized a 354 million tax benefit in connection with recent irs guidance received by the company regarding the company’s sale of equitable gas a regulated entity in 2013 the transaction included a partial likekind exchange of assets that resulted in tax deferral for the company however in order to be in compliance with the normalization rules of the internal revenue code the irs guidance held that the deferred tax liability associated with the exchanged regulatory assets should not be considered for ratemaking purposes as a result during the second quarter of 2015 the company recorded a regulatory asset equal to the taxes deferred from the exchange and an associated income tax benefit the regulatory asset and deferred taxes will be reversed when the assets are disposed of in a taxable transaction such as a sale of assets or amortized over the 32year remaining life of the assets received in the exchange in either event increasing tax expense at that time 

income tax expense increased 389 million  in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher pretax income partly offset by a decrease in the company’s effective income tax rate from 336  to 296  the decrease in the rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily related to an internal reorganization of subsidiaries resulting in a reduction of state taxes as well as an increase in noncontrolling interests related to eqm’s ownership structure for both periods the overall rate was lower than the federal statutory rate as the company consolidates 100 of the pretax income related to the noncontrolling public limited partners’ share of partnership earnings but is not required to record an income tax provision with respect to the portion of eqm’s earnings allocated to the noncontrolling public limited partners eqm’s earnings increased primarily due to the sunrise merger in 2013 and the jupiter transaction in 2014 each of which also resulted in increases in the noncontrolling limited public partners’ share of partnership earnings as described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the company has been in an overall federal taxable income position for the past three years primarily as a result of tax gains generated from the net proceeds received from the eqgp ipo and the nwv gathering transaction in 2015 the jupiter transaction in 2014 and the sunrise merger and the equitable gas transaction in 2013 during these periods the company utilized the nols generated from previous years and no longer had federal nols available as of december 31 2015

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of eqm was 1240 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 472 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the increase resulted from higher capacity reservation revenues and higher gathering revenues in eqm as well as increased noncontrolling interests in 2014 noncontrolling interests in eqm increased from 554 to 636 during the year ended december 31 2014 as a result of the underwritten public offering of additional common units representing limited partner interests in eqm in may 2014 in connection with the jupiter transaction 

outlook 

  

the company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas ngl and oil reserves through environmentally responsible costeffective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling the company’s revenues earnings liquidity and ability to grow are substantially dependent on the prices it receives for and the company’s ability to develop its reserves of natural gas ngls and oil despite the continued depressed price environment for natural gas ngls and oil the company believes the longterm outlook for its business is favorable due to the companys resource base low cost structure financial strength risk management including commodity hedging strategy and disciplined investment of capital the company believes the combination of these factors provide it with an opportunity to exploit and develop its positions and maximize efficiency through economies of scale in its strategic operating area 

the market prices for natural gas ngls and oil were depressed throughout 2015 and the early part of 2016 and continue to be volatile the average daily prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of 323  per mmbtu to a low of 176  per mmbtu from january 1 2015 through february 10 2016 and the average daily prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of 6143  per barrel to a low of 2655  per barrel during the same period in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian basis ngls and oil and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations however the company does expect natural gas and ngl prices particularly in the appalachian basin to remain depressed during 2016 

  

as a result of the continued low price environment the company suspended drilling on its permian basin upper devonian and central pennsylvania marcellus acreage during 2015 and focused its development plans on its core marcellus acreage in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia and its deep utica acreage the companys 2016 capital expenditure forecast for well development is 820 million  which is 51  lower than its 2015 capital expenditures for well development prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas ngl and oil prices could adversely affect among other things the 

companys development plans which would decrease the pace of the development and the level of the companys reserves as well as the companys revenues earnings or liquidity low prices may signal a need to further reduce capital spending or record additional noncash impairments in the book value of the company’s oil and gas properties or additional downward adjustments to the company’s estimated proved reserves any such additional impairment andor downward adjustment to the company’s estimated reserves could potentially be material to the company see “impairment of oil and gas properties” below 

in july 2015 the company turned inline its first dry gas focused deep utica well which experienced prolific initial results the company turned inline its second deep utica well in greene county pennsylvania in late december 2015 given the success of the two initial utica wells in greene county pennsylvania the company has decided to begin development of its deep utica acreage 

total capital investment by eqt in 2016 excluding acquisitions is expected to be approximately 18 billion  including eqm capital spending for well development primarily drilling and completion of approximately 08 billion  in 2016  is expected to support the drilling of approximately 77  gross wells including 72  marcellus wells and 5  deep utica wells depending upon the results of the 5 initial deep utica wells the company may drill an additional 5 deep utica wells during 2016 estimated sales volumes are expected to be 700  720 bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 18  in 2016  while ngl volumes are expected to be 10000  10500 mbbls to support continued growth in production the company plans to invest approximately 08 billion  on midstream infrastructure in 2016 primarily through eqm the 2016  capital investment plan is expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow generated from operations proceeds from midstream asset sales dropdowns to eqm and eqm capital raises 

the company continues to focus on creating and maximizing shareholder value through the implementation of a strategy that economically accelerates the monetization of its asset base and prudently pursues investment opportunities all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with solid cash flow the company monitors current and expected market conditions including the commodity price environment and its liquidity needs and may adjust its capital investment plan accordingly while the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions the company periodically considers arrangements to monetize the value of certain mature assets for redeployment into its highest value development opportunities 

impairment of oil and gas properties 

see “critical accounting policies and estimates” below and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company’s accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the company’s oil and gas properties due to declines in the fiveyear nymex forward strip prices during 2015 an indication of impairment of the company’s proved oil and gas properties existed as of december 31 2015 in accordance with its normal procedures the company estimated the future undiscounted cash flows from its oil and gas properties and compared these estimates to the carrying value of the properties as a result of these evaluations the company performed discounted cash flow analyses and recorded noncash pretax impairment charges to its proved oil and gas properties in 2015 including 943 million  in the noncore permian basin after this charge to the permian assets the carrying value of permian properties as of december 31 2015 was approximately 345 million  including approximately 300 million  of undeveloped properties because the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the company’s proved oil and gas properties in the marcellus play and the noncore huron and coalbed methane plays exceeded the carrying values of the respective properties the company did not recognize an impairment charge in 2015 related to these oil and gas properties however all other things being equal a further decline in the average fiveyear nymex forward strip prices in a future period may cause the company to recognize a significant impairment on the assets in the huron play which had a carrying value of approximately 3 billion at december 31 2015 

as described under “critical accounting policies and estimates” below the company makes a number of assumptions related to its accounting for oil and gas properties many of which require the company’s management to make significant judgments these assumptions which are generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the company’s management for internal planning and budgeting purposes include among other things anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted accordingly for basis differentials future operating and capital costs and inflation some of which are interdependent future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil are often volatile and assumptions regarding basis differentials future production and future operating costs are highly judgmental and in some cases difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in and the interdependence of these factors the company cannot predict if future impairment charges including impairment charges related to its huron oil and gas properties will be recognized and if so an estimate of the impairment charges that would be recorded in any future period see “recent natural gas ngl and oil price declines have resulted in impairment of certain of our noncore oil and gas properties future declines in commodity prices increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amounts of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods” under item 1a “risk factors” 

capital resources and liquidity 

  

the company’s primary sources of cash for the year ended december 31 2015 were cash flows from operating activities cash on hand proceeds from the ipo of eqgps common units proceeds from the public offerings of eqm’s common units and an increase in eqm’s debt the company’s primary use of cash in 2015 was for capital expenditures 

operating activities 

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities decreased 1978 million  from 14147 million  in 2014  to 12169 million  in 2015 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a 36  lower average realized price to eqt corporation on natural gas ngl and oil sales partially offset by a 27  increase in production sales volume and a decrease in income tax payments 

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities increased 2518 million  from 11629 million  in 2013  to 14147 million  in 2014  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a 26 increase in natural gas and ngl volumes sold increases in contracted transmission capacity and gathered volumes and a 146 million decrease in interest payments partially offset by a 411 million increase in income tax payments primarily due to taxes paid on transactions 

while the company is unable to predict future movements in the market price for commodities current prices are lower than average 2015 levels if current low price trends continue this trend would negatively impact the company’s cash flows from operating activities during the year ending december 31 2016

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 24442 million  for 2014 as compared to 9998 million  for 2013 the 14444 million  increase was primarily attributable to higher capital expenditures in 2014 including the 1673 million payment in 2014 in connection with the range asset exchange compared to proceeds received from the equitable gas transaction of 7406 million in 2013 as further described below the company increased cash capital expenditures from continuing operations by 725 million from 2013 to 2014

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005 the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco the savings guarantees provided that once the energyefficiency construction was completed by noresco the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately 134 million  as of december 31 2015 extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 12 years  

in december 2014 the company issued a performance guarantee the eqt mvp guarantee in connection with the obligations of mvp holdco to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the mvp upon the transfer of the company’s interest in mvp holdco to eqm on march 30 2015 eqm entered into a performance guarantee the initial eqm guarantee on terms and conditions similar to the eqt mvp guarantee and the eqt mvp guarantee was concurrently terminated upon the ferc’s initial release to begin construction of the mvp the initial eqm guarantee will terminate and eqm will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to 33  of mvp holdco’s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the mvp joint venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget less any credit assurances issued by any affiliate of eqm under such affiliates precedent agreement with the mvp joint venture as of february 11 2016 the initial eqm guarantee was in the amount of 91 million  

the noresco guarantees and the initial eqm guarantee are exempt from asc topic 460 guarantees the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

rate regulation 

  

as described under “regulation” in item 1 “business” the company’s transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

schedule of contractual obligations 

the table below presents the company’s longterm contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 in total and by periods purchase obligations exclude the company’s contractual obligations relating to its binding precedent agreements and other natural gas transmission and gathering capacity agreements with eqm for which future payments related to such agreements totaled 57 billion  as of december 31 2015 these capacity commitments have terms extending up to 20 years for a description of the transportation agreements see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements purchase obligations also exclude future capital contributions to the mvp joint venture and purchase obligations of the mvp joint venture

the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the second tranche of the 2014 eqt value driver award program see “critical accounting policies and estimates” below and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations 

as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 of 2593 million of which 1027 million is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s commitments and contingencies 

recently issued accounting standards 

the companys recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment generally on a fieldbyfield basis when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved and if determined reasonable by management riskadjusted probable and possible reserves utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions utilized by the companys management for internal planning and budgeting purposes including among other things the intended use of the asset anticipated production from reserves future market prices for natural gas ngls and oil adjusted accordingly for basis differentials future operating costs and inflation some of which are interdepedent proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes in development plans resulting from economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves prior to their expirations the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involves significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls future production costs estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of those recoveries see impairment of oil and gas properties above and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices operating costs economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the companys financial statements including strength of the balance sheet 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas ngl and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the 12month period which is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using statutory future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates production costs and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see impairment of oil and gas properties above for additional information regarding the company’s oil and gas reserves 

  

income taxes  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward incentive compensation and investment in eqm the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state nol carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 10 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted 

future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

derivative instruments the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use marketbased parameters as inputs including forward curves discount rates volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating the yield of a riskfree instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or market conditions or other factors change many of which are beyond the company’s control 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices both nymex and basis future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are spud the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation  the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009 and 2014 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock timebased restricted phantom units and stock options awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units 

  

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards awards under the 2014 eqt value driver award program are treated as liability awards phantom units expected to be satisfied in cash are also treated as liability awards for liability awards the company is required to estimate on grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through and value of the company’s common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award in the case of a performancebased award and until payment in the case of phantom units the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock or eqm common units are treated as equity awards awards under the 2013 executive performance incentive program the 2014 executive performance incentive program the 2014 eqm value driver award program the 2015 executive performance incentive program the 2015 eqt value driver award program and the eqm total return program each of which remained outstanding at december 31 2015 are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend or distribution yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend or distribution yield is based on the historical dividend or distribution yield of the company’s common stock or eqm’s common units as applicable and any changes expected thereto and where applicable of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock or eqm’s common units and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period historically three years for director phantom units which vest on date of grant expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company’s financial statements in the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based upon the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

  

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically two or three years the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock and eqms common units future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s sharebased compensation 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

commodity price risk and derivative instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast region in recent years due to the volatility of commodity prices the company is unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas including appalachian basis ngls and oil and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations however management does expect natural gas and ngl prices particularly in the appalachian basin to remain depressed during 2016 and expects market prices for these commodities to continue to be volatile in the future prolonged low andor significant or extended declines in natural gas ngl and oil prices could adversely affect among other things the company’s development plans which would decrease the pace of development and the level of the company’s reserves as well as the company’s revenues earnings or liquidity and could result in a material noncash impairment in the recorded value of the company’s oil and gas properties 

the companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of commodity price volatility is further described in notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in the capital resources and liquidity section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of these institutions is regularly monitored the company primarily enters into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s hedge and financial risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of the companys board of directors 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted sales of production most of which are hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels the company does not have any natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect a portion of cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the company hedged portions of expected sales of equity production portions of forecasted purchases and sales and portions of its basis exposure covering approximately 664 bcf and 563 bcf of natural gas respectively see the “commodity risk management” section in the “capital resources and liquidity” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2015  and 2014  levels would have increased the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1371 million and 1266 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2015  and 2014  levels would have decreased the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1384 million and 1265 million respectively 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the price change was then applied to the natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted equity production approximates a portion of the company’s 

expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on the company’s physical sales of natural gas assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk the anticipated transactions occur as expected and basis does not significantly change 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company eqgp and eqm earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates the company and eqm pay on borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities all of the company’s and eqm’s longterm borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s and eqm’s fixed rate debt see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s and eqm’s borrowings and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have limited credit risk because cftc regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from potential financial instability of the exchange members the company’s otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole 

the company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures these include closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 95 or 4174 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2015  had a positive fair value approximately 95 or 4585 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2014  had a positive fair value 

  

as of december 31 2015  the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to its derivative contracts the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales or transportation of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable of eqt production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas ngls and crude oil to certain marketers utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian basin and the northeastern united states as well as the permian basin of texas and a gas processor in kentucky and west virginia additionally a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable of eqt midstream are generated from the transmission and gathering of natural gas in kentucky virginia pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that expires in february 2019 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company as of december 31 2015  the company had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry 

eqm has a 750 million revolving credit facility that expires in february 2019 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by eqm as of december 31 2015  eqm had 299 million  of borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility eqm’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit eqm’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry

eqt production business segment 

  

eqt production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the appalachian basin with 107  tcfe of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves across approximately 34 million  gross acres including approximately 630000  gross acres in the marcellus play as of december 31 2014  eqt believes that it is a technology leader in extended lateral horizontal and completion drilling in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology eqt production’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves eqt’s proved reserves increased 29  in 2014  primarily across the marcellus shale play the company’s marcellus assets including upper devonian assets contribute approximately 87  tcfe in total proved reserves 

the following illustration depicts eqt’s acreage position within the marcellus play 

as of december 31 2014  the company’s proved reserves were as follows 



  

a includes lower huron cleveland berea sandstone and other devonian age formations 

  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2014  the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by 2014  produced volumes is 22  years 

the company invested approximately 1717 million  on well development during 2014  with total production sales volumes hitting a record high of 4763  bcfe an increase of 26  over the previous year capital spending for eqt production is expected to be approximately 185 billion  in 2015  excluding land acquisitions the majority of which will be used to support the drilling of approximately 191  gross wells including 122  marcellus wells 59  upper devonian wells and 10  other wells during the past three years the company’s number of wells drilled spud and related capital expenditures for well development were

eqt midstream business segment 

  

the appalachian basin has been an area of significant natural gas production growth in recent years the company believes that the current footprint of its midstream assets which spans a wide area of the marcellus shale in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia is a competitive advantage that uniquely positions it for growth in conjunction with the continued growth of eqt production and other producers in the marcellus eqt midstream is strategically positioned to capitalize on the rapidly increasing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in the region in particular there is a need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia 

in 2012  the company formed the partnership to own operate acquire and develop midstream assets in the appalachian basin the partnership provides midstream services to the company and other third parties through its two  primary assets the partnership’s transmission and storage system and the partnership’s gathering system as of december 31 2014  the company held a 344  limited partner interest and a 2  general partner interest in the partnership whose results are consolidated in the company’s financial statements unless otherwise noted discussions of eqt midstream’s business operations and results in this annual report on form 10k include the partnership’s business operations and results the company records the noncontrolling interest of the public limited partners in its financial statements 

  

the company’s gathering system includes approximately 8200  miles of gathering lines 1500  miles of which are fercregulated lowpressure gathering lines owned by the partnership the partnership also owns 45 miles of high pressure gathering lines which are not subject to federal rate regulation the lefthand map on page 12 depicts the company’s gathering lines and compressor stations in relationship to the marcellus shale formation during 2014  the company turned inline approximately 60 miles of pipeline and 80000 horse power of compression capacity primarily in the marcellus play which added approximately 475  mmcf per day of incremental gathering capacity resulting in yearend marcellus gathering capacity of 1975  mmcf per day consisting of 1405  mmcf per day in pennsylvania and 570  mmcf per day in west virginia 

eqt midstream’s transmission and storage system includes approximately 900  miles of fercregulated interstate pipeline that connects to seven  interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies the interstate pipeline system includes approximately 700  miles of pipe owned by equitrans lp equitrans and is referred to as the equitrans transmission and storage system equitrans is owned by the partnership eqt midstream’s transmission and storage system also includes an approximately 200 mile pipeline referred to as the allegheny valley connector avc which was acquired by the company in december 2013 in connection with the equitable gas transaction as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the transmission and storage system is supported by eighteen  natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 660  mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 47  bcf of working gas capacity fourteen  of these reservoirs representing 400  mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 32  bcf of working gas capacity are owned by the partnership the storage reservoirs are clustered in two  geographic areas connected to the partnership’s transmission and storage system with ten  in southwestern pennsylvania and eight  in northern west virginia the avc facilities include four  storage reservoirs owned by the company and operated by the partnership under a lease between the partnership and an affiliate of the company 

  

the righthand map on page 12 depicts the company’s transmission lines storage pools and compressor stations in relationship to the marcellus shale formation the company completed a number of midstream expansion projects in 2014  to take advantage of rapid production development in the marcellus play during 2014  the company added approximately 750  mmcf per day of incremental transmission capacity 550 mmcf per day of incremental transmission capacity through the completed jefferson compression expansion project as well as 200 mmcf per day of transmission capacity through several thirdparty contracts as a result of these expansion projects eqt midstream yearend total transmission capacity was approximately 3450 mmcf per day 

eqt midstream also has a gas marketing subsidiary eqt energy llc eqt energy that provides optimization of capacity and storage assets through its ngl and natural gas sales to commercial and industrial customers within its operational footprint eqt energy also provides marketing services and manages approximately 1400000  dth per day of thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity for the benefit of eqt production and has committed to an additional 850000  dth per day of thirdparty contractual capacity to come online in future periods eqt energy currently leases 37  bcf of storagerelated assets from third parties 

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure profitably developing its undeveloped reserves and effectively and efficiently utilizing its extensive gathering and transmission assets that are uniquely positioned across the marcellus shale and in close proximity to the northeastern united states markets 

eqt believes that it is a technology leader in extendedlateral horizontal drilling and completion in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology substantially all of the company’s acreage is held by production or in fee therefore eqt production is able to develop its acreage in the most economical manner through the use of longer laterals and multiwell pads as opposed to being required to drill lesseconomical wells in order to retain acreage the use of multiwell pads in conjunction with a completion technique known as reduced cluster spacing has the additional benefit of reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the company’s drilling operations 

  

eqt also believes that its midstream assets are strategically located in the marcellus shale region – spanning a large prolific area of southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia – providing a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the company for continued growth eqt midstream intends to capitalize on the rapidly growing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in this region and in particular the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia additionally eqt entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of nextera energy inc to construct the mvp the proposed pipeline is expected to be approximately 300 miles long span from wetzel county west virginia to pittsylvania county virginia and be designed to transport natural gas production from the marcellus and utica to the growing demand markets in the southeast region of the united states 

  

the ongoing efforts of the partnership are also an important support mechanism for eqt’s overall business strategy through pursuing accretive acquisitions from the company capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities and attracting additional thirdparty volumes the partnership is expected to grow profitably and provide an ongoing source of capital to the company

markets and customers 

  

natural gas sales  the company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian basin and the northeastern united states as well as the permian basin of texas the company’s current transportation portfolio also enables the company to reach markets along the gulf coast of the united states natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to the price at henry hub located in louisiana which is the location for pricing nymex and natural gas futures as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the northeast region in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production most of which is hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth in “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas in mid2011 eqt opened a publicaccess natural gas fueling station in pittsburgh pennsylvania and with the growing demand for compressed natural gas for numerous fleets throughout the region the station underwent an expansion in 2013 adding two more dispensers in conjunction with this project the company is promoting the use of natural gas with its own fleet vehicles and plans to operate 14 of its lightduty vehicle fleet more than 180 vehicles on natural gas by the end of 2015 in addition the company is operating four drilling rigs that utilize natural gas with three additional expected in 2015 and one hydraulic fracturing crew with one additional crew expected in 2015 

ngl sales   the company sells ngls from its own production through the eqt production segment and from gas marketed for third parties by eqt midstream in its appalachian operations the company contracts with markwest energy partners lp markwest to process natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas ngls are recovered at the processing plants and transported to a fractionation plant owned by markwest for separation into commercial components markwest markets these components for a fee the company also has contractual processing arrangements in its permian basin operations whereby the company sells gas to thirdparty processors at a weighted average liquids component price 

the following table presents the average sales price on an average per mcfe basis to eqt corporation for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without cash settled derivatives for the years ended december 31 



  

in addition price information for all products is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “consolidated operational data” and incorporated herein by reference 

  

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to four major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company dominion transmission and tennessee gas pipeline company the gathering system also maintains interconnections with the partnership’s transmission and storage system 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2014  totaled 5905  tbtu of which approximately 90  related to gathering for eqt production and other affiliates revenues from eqt production and other affiliates accounted for approximately 91  of 2014  gathering revenues 

  

natural gas transmission storage and marketing  natural gas transmission and storage operations are executed using transmission and underground storage facilities owned by the company eqt energy provides marketing services and thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of eqt production and also leases storage capacity in order to take advantage of seasonal spreads where available through the eqt midstream segment eqt energy also engages in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of eqt production the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices 

  

customers of eqt midstream’s gas transportation and storage services are affiliates and third parties primarily in the northeastern united states 

  

as of december 31 2014  the weighted average remaining contract life based on total projected contracted revenues for the partnership’s firm transmission and storage contracts was approximately 17  years the company anticipates that the capacity associated with expiring contracts will be remarketed or used by affiliates such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed in 2014  approximately 57  of transportation volumes and 51 of transportation revenues were from affiliates 

  

one  customer within the eqt production segment accounts for approximately 12  and 11  of eqt production’s total operating revenues in 2014  and 2013  respectively the company does not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the company’s natural gas are available no  single customer accounted for more than 10  of revenues in 2012  

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production transportation and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators competition for natural gas gathering transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates and other commercial terms customer commitment levels timing performance reliability service levels location reputation and fuel efficiencies key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines key competitors for gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies eqt competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and ngls some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers 

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction well stimulation hydraulic fracturing and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations may affect the costs and timing of developing the company’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties kentucky ohio virginia and for utica or other deep wells west virginia allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in west virginia the company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for marcellus and upper devonian acreage in 2013 the pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases and texas permits similar joint development in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and texas sets production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well 

  

eqt midstream’s transmission and gathering operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

  

the interstate natural gas transmission systems and storage operations of eqt midstream are regulated by the ferc and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the ferc for instance the ferc approves tariffs that establish the partnership’s rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service to the partnership’s customers the fees or rates established under the partnership’s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority over transmission operations also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

in 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation as of the filing date of this annual report the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other cftc rules that may be relevant to the company have yet to be finalized because significant cftc rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company has experienced increased and expects additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

  

regulators periodically review or audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the us congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing including drilling operating and abandoning wells pipelines and related facilities 

  

the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations the company conducts baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500  feet of our drilling pads legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells 

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of expenditures related to environmental matters 

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation the epa and various states have issued a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas ngl and oil price volatility may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas ngls and oil the markets for natural gas ngls and oil are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results the price of natural gas ngls and oil are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions and seasonal trends the supply of and demand for natural gas ngls and oil regional basis differentials national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

lower natural gas ngl and oil prices may result in decreases in the revenue operating income and cash flow for each of our businesses a reduction in drilling activity and the construction of new transportation capacity as well as downward adjustments to the value of our oil and gas properties which may cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings moreover a failure to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas ngl and oil prices could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position a reduction in operating income or cash flow will reduce our funds available for capital expenditures and correspondingly our opportunities for profitable growth we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value if commodity prices continue to trend lower as they did in the latter part of 2014 it could signal a need to reduce capital spending be an indicator of impairment of the company’s assets and have a substantial impact on among other things the company’s revenues earnings liquidity reserves dda rates and development plans 

  

increases in natural gas ngl and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation and storage of natural gas and ngls such as well site blowouts cratering and explosions pipe and other equipment and system failures uncontrolled flows of natural gas or well fluids fires formations with abnormal pressures pollution and environmental risks and natural disasters we also face various threats to the security of our or third parties’ facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants and pipelines these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment pollution or other environmental damage disruptions to our operations and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

cyber incidents may adversely impact our operations 

  

our business has become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies including information systems infrastructure and cloud applications to operate our production and midstream businesses and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats deliberate attacks on or unintentional events affecting our systems or infrastructure the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data delays in production or delivery of natural gas and ngls difficulty in completing and settling transactions challenges in maintaining our books and records communication interruptions environmental damage personal injury property damage other operational disruptions and thirdparty liability further as cyber incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents 

  

our failure to develop obtain access or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas ngls and oil to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of gas ngls and oil depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities the capacity of transportation gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells competition for pipeline infrastructure within the region is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could affect our competitive position the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas ngl and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors moreover if our infrastructure development and maintenance programs are not successfully developed on time and within budget we may not be able to profitably fulfill our contractual obligations to third parties including joint venture partners 

we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty natural gas ngl and oil transportation gathering processing and storage facilities which are limited in number geographically concentrated and subject to the same risks identified above with respect to our infrastructure development and maintenance programs because we do not own these thirdparty pipelines or facilities their continuing operation is not within our control an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas ngls and oil in such an event we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor sell our production at prices lower than market prices or at prices lower than we currently project in addition some of our thirdparty contracts may involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part moreover our usage of third parties for transportation gathering and processing services subjects us to the credit and performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas ngls and oil to market 

also our producing properties and operations are primarily in the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas as a result we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production caused by transportation capacity constraints curtailment of production availability of equipment facilities personnel or services significant governmental regulation natural disasters adverse weather conditions plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of gas and ngls produced from this area 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2015 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activities midstream infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital and evaluated opportunities outside of the appalachian basin notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2015 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies including the appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely 

affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2015 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions including joint ventures these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals and our ability to achieve benefits anticipated to result from the transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility moreover joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties such as committing us to fund operating andor capital expenditures the timing and amount of which we may have little control over and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering and transmission systems and pipelines environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling and pipeline construction environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety including replacement requirements and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business or result in delays due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed governmental approvals and permits these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transportation and storage businesses are in many cases subject to federal regulation by the ferc which may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances andor expense deferrals 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming in addition to periodic changes to air water and waste laws as well as recent epa initiatives to impose climate changebased air regulations on the industry the us congress and various states have been evaluating climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

another area of potential regulation is hydraulic fracturing which we utilize to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation or regulation has been proposed or is under discussion at federal state and local levels for instance legislation or regulation banning hydraulic fracturing has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions in which we do not have drilling operations we cannot predict whether any other such federal state or local legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how it may affect our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs 

  

recent discussions regarding the federal budget have included proposals which could potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal and collaterally state income taxes of independent producers with the potential repeal of the ability to expense intangible drilling costs having the most significant potential future impact to us these changes if enacted will make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our natural gas resources 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

in 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the legislation known as the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation as of the filing date of this annual report the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other rules that may be relevant to the company or its counterparties have yet to be finalized because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the company’s hedging program including available counterparties or regulatory compliance obligations the company has experienced increased and anticipates additional compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

  

we rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including access to capital markets and changes in the terms of and cost of capital including increases in interest rates may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas ngls and oil which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings 

  

any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity we cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish our financial results 

  

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a well is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the natural gas ngls and oil to market moreover an incorrect determination of legal title to our wells could result in liability to the owner of the natural gas or oil rights and an impairment to our assets successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect in addition any exploration projects increase the risks inherent in our production activities specifically seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas or other hydrocarbons which could adversely affect the results of our operations because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the amount and timing of actual future gas ngl and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions natural gas ngl and oil price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas ngls and oil can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together 

with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

we also rely on third parties for certain construction drilling and completion services materials and supplies delays or failures to perform by such third parties could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things oil spills the explosion of natural gas transmission lines and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

  

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 

  

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil and the amount timing and cost of actual production in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngl and oil industry in general 

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

principal facilities are owned or in the case of certain office locations warehouse buildings and equipment leased by the company’s business segments the majority of the company’s properties are located on or under i private properties owned in fee held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles or ii public highways under franchises or permits from various governmental authorities the company’s facilities are generally well maintained and where appropriate are replaced or expanded to meet operating requirements 

  

eqt production   eqt production’s properties are located primarily in pennsylvania west virginia ohio kentucky and texas this segment has approximately 34 million  gross acres approximately 64  of which are considered undeveloped which encompass substantially all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil producing properties approximately 630000  of these gross acres are located in the marcellus play although most of its wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths  2000  to 8000  feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2014  the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 107  tcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 47  tcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 01  tcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 59  tcfe substantially all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngl and oil reserves is prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for preparing the reserve report and the technical aspects of the reserves audit received a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has 17  years of experience in the oil and gas industry to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally division of interest and production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve reconciliation between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas ngl and oil reserves is audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp ryder scott which is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally ryder scott reviewed 100  of the total net natural gas ngl and oil proved reserves attributable to the company’s interests as of december 31 2014  ryder scott conducted a detailed well by well audit of the company’s largest properties this audit covered 80  of the company’s proved developed reserves ryder scott’s audit of the remaining 20  of the company’s proved developed properties consisted of an audit of aggregated groups not exceeding 200  wells per case for operated wells and 230 wells per case for nonoperated wells for undeveloped locations ryder scott determined which areas within the company’s acreage were to be considered proven reserves were assigned and projected by the company’s reserves engineers for locations within these proven areas and approved by ryder scott based on analogous type curves and offset production information ryder scott’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 99 

  

no  report has been filed with any federal authority or agency reflecting a 5  or more difference from the company’s estimated total reserves additional information relating to the company’s estimates of natural gas ngl and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows is provided in note 21 unaudited to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in 2014  the company commenced drilling operations spud or drilled on 237  gross horizontal wells with an aggregate of approximately 14 million  feet of pay in the marcellus including upper devonian play total proved reserves in the marcellus including upper devonian play increased 42  to 87  tcfe in 2014  primarily as a result of the company’s 2014 and 2013 drilling programs in the huron play the company spud 103  gross horizontal wells during 2014  with an aggregate of approximately 605000  feet of pay total proved reserves in the huron play decreased approximately 6  to 12  tcfe as the company ceased development of the huron play and removed remaining proved undeveloped locations as they are no longer in the five year development program production sales volumes in 2014  from the marcellus including upper devonian and huron plays were 3782  bcfe and 338  bcfe respectively over the past three  years the company has experienced a 99  developmental drilling success rate

summary of proved natural gas oil and ngl reserves as of december 31 2014  based on average fiscal year prices 



  



as of december 31 2014  the company had a total of 153 bcfe of reserves that have been classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years these reserves are associated with two wells that were drilled in 2014 and that are scheduled to be completed and producing in 2015 

  

certain lease and acquisition agreements require the company to drill a specific number of wells in 2015  within the marcellus formation the company is required to drill three  wells in 2015  the company intends to satisfy such requirements either directly through its 2015  development program or indirectly by contracting with a third party to do so including through an assignment of the lease farmout or other arrangement 

  

as of december 31 2014  leases associated with approximately 45551  gross undeveloped acres expire in 2015  if they are not renewed this acreage is in addition to the acreage that may be lost if drilling obligations are not met the company has an active lease renewal program in areas targeted for development

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company 

  

environmental proceedings 

  

in june and august 2012 the company received three notices of violation novs from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the padep the novs alleged violations of the pennsylvania oil and gas act and clean streams law in connection with the unintentional release in may 2012 by a company vendor of water from an impaired water pit at a company well location in tioga county pennsylvania since confirming the release the company has cooperated with the padep in remediating the affected areas 

during the second quarter of 2014 the company received a proposed consent assessment of civil penalty cacp from the padep and the pennsylvania fish and boat commission the pfbc under the cacp the padep proposed a civil penalty related to the novs and the pfbc proposed a civil penalty related to possible violations of the pennsylvania fish and boat code the company entered into settlement discussions regarding the assessed penalty with the pfbc and unsuccessfully attempted to do the same with the padep the company was unable to resolve the padep claims due to the agency’s interpretation of the penalty provisions of the clean streams law accordingly on september 19 2014 the company filed a declaratory judgment action in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania against the padep seeking a court ruling on the legal interpretation the company did not include the pfbc in the action due to ongoing settlement discussions 

on september 30 2014 the pfbc filed a misdemeanor complaint against the company through the pennsylvania attorney general’s office in the tioga county court the company has initiated settlement discussions with the attorney general’s office 

on october 7 2014 the padep filed a complaint against the company before the pennsylvania environmental hearing board seeking 45 million in civil penalties the company believes the padep’s penalty assessment is legally flawed and unsupportable under the clean streams law 

while the company expects these claims to result in penalties that exceed 100000 the company expects the resolution of these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material impact on the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company

consolidated results of continuing operations 

  

2014  eqt overview 

  

• annual production sales volumes of 4763  bcfe 26  higher than 2013   

• marcellus sales volumes of 3782  bcfe 38  higher than 2013   

• gathered volumes of 5905  tbtu 27  higher than 2013   

• increased proved reserves by 29  to 107  tcfe 

• the partnership completed an underwritten public offering of common units representing limited partner interests 

• the partnership issued 400 senior notes of 5000 million due august 1 2024 

 

income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2014  was 3856 million  253  per diluted share compared with 2987 million  197  per diluted share in 2013  the 869 million  increase in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation was primarily attributable to a 26 increase in production sales volumes favorable gains on derivatives not designated as hedges increases in contracted transmission capacity and throughput and gathered volumes favorable changes in hedging ineffectiveness and lower interest expense these factors were partially offset by impairments of longlived assets higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of the partnership higher transportation and processing expenses higher income tax expense higher selling general and administrative sga expense and higher depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense 

  

operating income was 8534 million  in 2014  compared to 6546 million  in 2013  an increase of 1988 million  eqt production sales volumes increased 26 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2014 and 2013 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the average realized price to eqt production for sales volumes was 323 per mcfe in 2014 compared to 315 per mcfe in 2013 eqt production total net operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 included 838 million of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments compared to 03 million of derivative losses for the year ended december 31 2013 the 838 million of derivative gains for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments for the year ended december 31 2014 included 365 million of cash settlements received which is included in the average realized price to eqt production of 323 per mcfe in 2014 the year ended december 31 2014 also included a 248 million gain for hedging ineffectiveness of financial hedges compared to a 213 million loss for ineffectiveness of financial hedges for the year ended december 31 2013 

transmission net operating revenues increased as a result of higher firm transmission contracted capacity and throughput for third parties and eqt production as well as higher interruptible transmission service the increase in transmission net operating revenues is the result of increased production development in the marcellus play gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 27 increase in gathered volumes partially offset by an 11 decrease in the average gathering fee the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play the decrease in the average gathering fee resulted from increased gathered volumes in the marcellus play as the marcellus gathering rate is lower than the rate in other areas 

operating expenses for 2014  were 16505 million  compared to 12270 million  in 2013  an increase of 4235 million  excluding the 2673 million impairment charge described in more detail in business segment results of operations  eqt production and 262 million increase in depreciation and depletion operating expenses increased 1300 million this increase was primarily attributable to higher transportation and processing expenses and higher sga costs consistent with the growth in the production and midstream businesses 

on may 7 2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of the company eqt gathering contributed a highpressure gathering system to eqm gathering a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership in exchange for 118 billion  the jupiter transaction eqm gathering is consolidated by the company as it is still controlled by the company 

on may 7 2014 the partnership completed an underwritten public offering of 12362500  common units which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option representing partnership limited partner interests the partnership received net proceeds of approximately 9025 million  from the offering after deducting the underwriters’ discount and offering expenses of approximately 340 million  as of december 31 2014 the company held a 2  general partner interest all incentive 

distribution rights and a 344  limited partner interest in the partnership the company’s limited partner interest in the partnership consists of 3959952  common units and 17339718  subordinated units 

in june 2014  the company exchanged certain assets with range the company received approximately 73000  net acres and approximately 900  producing wells most of which are vertical wells in the permian basin of texas in exchange range received approximately 138000  net acres in the company’s nora field of virginia the company’s working interest in approximately 2000  producing vertical wells in the nora field the company’s remaining 50  ownership interest in nora llc which owns the supporting gathering system in the nora field and 1673 million  in cash 

in august 2014 the partnership issued 400 senior notes 400 senior notes due august 1 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of 5000 million net proceeds of the offering of 4923 million  were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under the partnership’s credit facility and for general partnership purposes 

income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2013 was 2987 million 197 per diluted share compared with 1359 million 090 per diluted share in 2012 the 1628 million increase in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation between periods was primarily attributable to a 43 increase in natural gas volumes sold increases in contracted transmission capacity and throughput and gathered volumes the gain on sale of certain energy marketing contracts by eqt energy in december 2013 and lower interest expense these factors were partially offset by higher dda expense higher income tax expense higher sga expense and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of the partnership 

operating income was 6546 million in 2013 compared to 3896 million in 2012 an increase of 2650 million the increase in operating income was attributable to a 43 increase in natural gas volumes sold increased transmission pipeline revenues and gathered volumes and a 196 million pretax gain from the disposal of customer contracts by eqt energy partially offset by higher dda expense and higher sga expense 

production sales volumes increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2013 and 2012 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the average realized price to eqt production for sales volumes was 315 per mcfe in 2013 compared to 300 per mcfe in 2012 gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 39 increase in gathered volumes partially offset by a 17 decrease in the average gathering fee the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play the decrease in the average gathering fee resulted from increased gathered volumes in the marcellus play as the marcellus gathering rate is lower than the rate in other areas 

operating expenses for 2013 were 12270 million compared to 9876 million in 2012 an increase of 2394 million this increase was primarily attributable to higher dda charges attributable to higher production volumes at a production depletion rate of 150 per mcfe in 2013 compared to 152 per mcfe in 2012 and higher productionrelated and sga costs consistent with the growth in the production and midstream businesses

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on riskadjusted proved and in some cases probable reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be written down to fair value which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

  

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” as the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involves significant judgment about future events such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls future production costs estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of those recoveries see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements including cash flow to the company and strength of the balance sheet 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within 

the 12month period which is subject to change in subsequent periods operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations cash flow to the company and strength of the balance sheet for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

income taxes  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward incentive compensation and investment in the partnership the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state nol carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 9 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

derivative instruments the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use as inputs marketbased parameters including but not limited to forward curves discount rates broker quotes volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating the yield of a riskfree instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or market conditions or other factors change many of which are beyond the company’s control 

in addition the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices of natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements given the company’s price risk management position and price volatility the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices both nymex and basis and by changes in margin requirements future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are spud the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation  the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 2009 and 2014 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock and stock options awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units 

  

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards awards under the 2014 eqt value driver award program are treated as liability awards phantom units which vest upon grant expected to be satisfied in cash are also treated as liability awards for liability awards the company is required to estimate on grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through and value of the company’s common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award in the case of a performancebased award and until payment in the case of phantom units the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

  

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock or partnership common units are treated as equity awards awards under the 2012 executive performance incentive program the 2013 executive performance incentive program the 2013 value driver award program the 2014 executive performance incentive program the 2014 eqm value driver award program and the eqm total return program which remained outstanding at december 31 2014 are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend or distribution yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend or distribution yield is based on the historical dividend or distribution yield of the company’s common stock or the partnership’s common units as applicable and any changes expected thereto and where applicable of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock or the partnership’s common units and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period historically three years for phantom units which vest on date of grant expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company’s financial statements in 

the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based upon the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

  

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically two or three years the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s sharebased compensation 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls which can affect the operating results of the company primarily at eqt production the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of these institutions is regularly monitored the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge basis and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s hedge and financial risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

commodity price risk 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted sales of production most of which is hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels the company does not have any natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company may also use other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the company hedged portions of expected sales of equity production portions of forecasted purchases and sales and portions of its basis exposure covering approximately 563 bcf and 388 bcf of natural gas respectively see the “commodity risk management” section in the “capital resources and liquidity” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2014  and 2013  levels would increase the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1266 million and 1517 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2014  and 2013  levels would decrease the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1265 million and 1516 million respectively 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  the price change was then applied to the natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted equity production approximates a portion of the company’s expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on the company’s physical sales of natural gas assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk the anticipated transactions occur as expected and basis does not significantly change 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company and the partnership earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates the company and the partnership pay on borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities all of the the company’s and the partnership’s longterm borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s and the partnership’s fixed rate debt see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s and the partnership’s borrowings and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have limited credit risk because cftc regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from potential financial instability of the exchange members the company’s otc derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole 

the company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures these include closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 95 or 4585 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2014  had a positive fair value approximately 79 or 1074 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts at december 31 2013  had a positive fair value 

  

as of december 31 2014  the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to derivative contracts the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales or transportation of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas ngls and crude oil to certain marketers utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian basin and the northeastern united states as well as the permian basin of texas and a gas processor in kentucky and west virginia additionally a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt midstream are generated from the transportation or gathering of natural gas in kentucky virginia pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that expires in february 2019 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company as of december 31 2014  the company had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry 

  

the partnership has a 750 million revolving credit facility that expires in february 2019 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the partnership as of december 31 2014  the partnership had no loans and letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the partnership’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the partnership’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry

part iv 

  


 item 1   business 

  

general 

  

eqt corporation eqt or the company conducts its business through two business segments eqt production and eqt midstream eqt production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the appalachian basin with 83 tcfe of proved natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves across approximately 36 million gross acres including approximately 580000 gross acres in the marcellus play as of december 31 2013 eqt midstream provides gathering transmission and storage services for the company’s produced gas as well as for independent third parties across the appalachian basin 

  

key events in 2013 

  

during 2013 eqt achieved record annual production sales volumes including a 43 increase in total sales volumes and an 82 increase in marcellus sales volumes the midstream business delivered record gathered volumes that were 39 higher than the previous year the company also completed the following transactions that were instrumental in contributing to a successful 2013 

  

·   on july 22 2013 sunrise pipeline llc sunrise a subsidiary of the company merged with and into equitrans lp equitrans a subsidiary of eqt midstream partners lp the partnership with equitrans continuing as the surviving company the sunrise merger sunrise continues to be consolidated by the company as it is still under common control 

  

·   on july 22 2013 the partnership completed an underwritten public offering of 12650000 common units representing partnership limited partner interests following the offering and the closing of the sunrise merger the company holds a 446 equity interest in the partnership including a 2 general partner interest the partnership received net proceeds of 5294 million from the offering after deducting the underwriters’ discount and offering expenses of 209 million 

  

·   on december 17 2013 the company and its whollyowned subsidiary distribution holdco llc holdco completed a previously announced transaction relating to the company holdco and png companies llc png companies the parent company of peoples natural gas company llc as part of the transaction the company and holdco transferred 100 of their ownership interests in equitable gas company llc equitable gas and equitable homeworks llc homeworks to png companies as consideration for this transaction the company received a 7406 million cash payment based on initial postclosing adjustments select midstream assets including an approximately 200mile fercregulated natural gas transmission pipeline that interconnects with the partnership’s transmission and storage system the avc facilities and new commercial arrangements with png companies and its affiliates these events are collectively referred to in this annual report on form 10k as the equitable gas transaction 

  

equitable gas and homeworks comprised substantially all of the company’s previously reported distribution segment the financial information of equitable gas and homeworks is reflected as discontinued operations in this annual report on form 10k with all prior periods recast to reflect the presentation of discontinued operations 

  

eqt production business segment 

  

eqt believes that it is a technology leader in extended lateral horizontal and completion drilling in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology eqt production’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves eqt’s proved reserves increased 39 in 2013 to a total of 83 tcfe primarily across the marcellus and huron shale plays and also including cbm and other vertical wells the company’s marcellus assets including upper devonian assets contribute approximately 62 tcfe in total proved reserves 

  

  

the following illustration depicts eqt’s acreage position within the marcellus play 

  

  

  

  

  

as of december 31 2013 the company’s proved reserves were as follows 

  

  

   

 includes the lower huron cleveland berea sandstone and other devonian age formations 

  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2013 the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by 2013 produced volumes is 23 years 

  

the company invested approximately 1237 million on well development during 2013 with total production sales volumes hitting a record high of 3782 bcfe an increase of 43 over the previous year capital spending for eqt production is expected to be approximately 19 billion in 2014 excluding land acquisitions the majority of which will be used to support the drilling of approximately 357 gross wells including 186 marcellus wells 120 huron wells 30 upper devonian wells and 21 wells in the utica shale of ohio during the past three years the company’s number of wells drilled spud and related capital expenditures for well development were 

  

   

  

   

 includes upper devonian formations 

  

eqt midstream business segment 

  

the appalachian basin has been an area of significant natural gas production growth in recent years the company believes that the current footprint of its midstream assets which spans a wide area of the marcellus shale in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia is a competitive advantage that uniquely positions it for growth in conjunction with the continued growth of eqt production and other producers in the marcellus eqt midstream is strategically positioned to capitalize on the rapidly increasing need for gathering and 

  

  

transmission infrastructure in the region in particular there is a need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

in 2012 the company formed the partnership to own operate acquire and develop midstream assets in the appalachian basin the partnership provides midstream services to the company and other third parties through its two primary assets the partnership’s transmission and storage system and the partnership’s gathering system as of december 31 2013 the company held a 426 limited partner interest and a 2 general partner interest in the partnership whose results are consolidated in the company’s financial statements unless otherwise noted discussions of eqt midstream’s business operations and results in this annual report on form 10k include the partnership’s business operations and results the company records the noncontrolling interest of the public limited partners in its financial statements 

  

the company’s gathering system includes approximately 9450 miles of gathering lines 1600 miles of which are fercregulated lowpressure gathering lines owned by the partnership the lefthand map on page 11 depicts the company’s gathering lines and compressor stations in relationship to the marcellus shale formation during 2013 the company completed various gathering line expansion projects that added approximately 385 mmcf per day of incremental gathering capacity and resulted in yearend marcellus gathering capacity of 1500 mmcf per day 1150 mmcf per day in pennsylvania and 350 mmcf per day in west virginia to support the ongoing production of natural gas throughout the marcellus region the company plans to add approximately 440 mmcf per day of incremental gathering capacity in 2014 120 mmcf per day in pennsylvania and 320 mmcf per day in west virginia 

  

eqt midstream’s transmission and storage system includes approximately 900 miles of fercregulated interstate pipeline that connects to seven interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies the interstate pipeline system includes approximately 700 miles of pipe owned by equitrans and referred to as the equitrans transmission and storage system equitrans is owned by the partnership eqt midstream’s transmission and storage system also includes an approximately 200 mile pipeline referred to as the allegheny valley connector avc which was acquired by the company in connection with the equitable gas transaction 

  

the transmission and storage system is supported by eighteen natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 660 mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 47 bcf of working gas capacity fourteen of these reservoirs representing 400 mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 32 bcf of working gas capacity are owned by the partnership the storage reservoirs are clustered in two geographic areas connected to the partnership’s transmission and storage system with ten in southwestern pennsylvania and eight in northern west virginia the avc facilities include four storage reservoirs owned by the company and are operated by the partnership under a lease between the partnership and an affiliate of the company 

  

the righthand map on page 11 depicts the company’s transmission lines storage pools and compressor stations in relationship to the marcellus shale formation the company completed a number of midstream expansion projects in 2013 to take advantage of rapid production development in the marcellus play during 2013 the company added approximately 450 mmcf per day of incremental transmission capacity in pennsylvania through the morris iii interconnect expansion and the low pressure east pipeline uprate projects as a result of these expansion projects and the avc acquisition eqt midstream yearend total transmission capacity was 2700 mmcf per day during 2014 the company expects to complete the fully subscribed jefferson compression expansion project which is expected to add an additional 650 bbtu per day of transmission capacity in pennsylvania as well as an expansion of the westside of its northern west virginia transmission system referred to as the westside expansion project that is expected to add 100 bbtu per day of capacity 

  

  

  

  

eqt midstream also has a gas marketing subsidiary eqt energy llc eqt energy that provides optimization of capacity and storage assets through its ngl and natural gas sales to commercial and industrial customers within its operational footprint eqt energy also provides marketing services and manages approximately 1000000 dth per day of thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity for the benefit of eqt production and has committed to an additional 750000 dth per day of contractual capacity to come online in future periods eqt energy currently leases 32 bcf of storagerelated assets from third parties 

  

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure profitably developing its undeveloped reserves and effectively and efficiently utilizing its extensive gathering and 

  

  

transmission assets that are uniquely positioned across the marcellus shale and in close proximity to the northeastern united states markets 

  

eqt believes that it is a technology leader in extendedlateral horizontal drilling and completion in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology substantially all of the company’s acreage is held by production or in fee therefore eqt production is able to develop its acreage in the most economical manner through the use of longer laterals and multiwell pads as opposed to being required to drill lesseconomical wells in order to retain acreage the use of multiwell pads in conjunction with a completion technique known as reduced cluster spacing has the additional benefit of reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the company’s drilling operations 

  

eqt also believes that its midstream assets are strategically located in the marcellus shale region – spanning a large prolific area of southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia – providing a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the company for continued growth eqt midstream intends to capitalize on the rapidly growing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in this region and in particular the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the ongoing efforts of the partnership are also an important support mechanism for eqt’s overall business strategy through pursuing accretive acquisitions from the company capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities and attracting additional thirdparty volumes the partnership is expected to provide an ongoing source of capital to the company 

  

the company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas in mid2011 with the assistance of a 700000 grant received from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection eqt opened a publicaccess natural gas fueling station in pittsburgh pennsylvania with the growing popularity and importance of this station to numerous fleets throughout the region the station underwent an expansion in 2013 – adding two more service bays in conjunction with this project the company is promoting the use of natural gas fleet vehicles including its own and plans to operate 15 of its lightduty vehicle fleet more than 180 vehicles on natural gas by the end of 2014 in addition the company is operating four drilling rigs that utilize natural gas and one hydraulic fracturing unit with an additional unit expected in 2014

markets and customers 

  

natural gas sales the company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian basin and a gas processor in kentucky and west virginia natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas can be volatile as demonstrated by significant declines in late 2011 and early 2012 in addition the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin experienced a decline relative to the price at henry hub which is the location for pricing nymex and natural gas futures in the second half of 2013 as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the northeast region changes in the market price for natural gas including basis impact the company’s revenues earnings and liquidity the company is unable to predict potential future movements in the market price for natural gas including appalachian basis and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations however the company monitors the market for natural gas and adjusts strategy and operations as deemed to be appropriate in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production most of which is hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth in “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

ngl sales   the company sells ngls from its own production through the eqt production segment and from gas marketed for third parties by eqt midstream until february 2011 when the company sold its langley natural gas processing complex langley the company processed natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid 

  

  

hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas ngls were recovered at langley and transported to a fractionation plant owned by a third party for separation into commercial components the third party marketed these components for a fee the company also had contractual processing arrangements whereby the company sold gas to a thirdparty processor at a weighted average liquids component price subsequent to the closing of the sale of langley to markwest energy partners lp in february 2011 the processing of the company’s produced natural gas has been performed by a thirdparty vendor 

  

the following table presents the effective sales price on an average mcfe basis to eqt corporation for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without hedges for the years ended december 31 

  

   

in addition realized price information for all products is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “consolidated operational data” and incorporated herein by reference 

  

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to four major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company dominion transmission and tennessee gas pipeline company the gathering system also maintains interconnections with the partnership’s transmission and storage system 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2013 totaled 4664 bbtu of which approximately 79 related to gathering for eqt production 9 related to thirdparty volumes and 12 related to volumes for other affiliates of the company revenues from eqt production and other affiliates accounted for approximately 88 of 2013 gathering revenues 

  

natural gas transmission storage and marketing natural gas transmission and storage operations are executed using transmission and underground storage facilities owned andor operated by the company or the partnership eqt energy provides marketing services and thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of eqt production and leases storage capacity in order to take advantage of seasonal spreads where available eqt energy also engages in risk management and energy trading activities the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets 

  

customers of eqt midstream’s gas transportation storage risk management and related services are affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and ugi energy services inc 

  

as of december 31 2013 the weighted average remaining contract life based on total projected contracted revenues for the partnership’s firm transmission and storage contracts was approximately 15 years the company anticipates that the capacity associated with expiring contracts will be remarketed or used by affiliates such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed in 2013 approximately 80 of transportation volumes and revenues were from affiliates 

  

the company had one customer within the eqt production segment account for approximately 11 of its revenues in 2013 the company does not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the company’s natural gas are available no single customer accounted for more than 10 of revenues in 2012 or 2011 

  

  

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators competition for natural gas gathering transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates and other commercial terms customer commitment levels timing performance reliability service levels location reputation and fuel efficiencies key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines key competitors for gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies eqt competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and ngls some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers 

  

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations may affect the costs and timing of developing the company’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties both kentucky and virginia allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration in 2013 the pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation which authorizes joint development of existing leases in west virginia it is necessary to rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas 

  

eqt midstream’s transmission and gathering operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of and the time to develop new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

  

the interstate natural gas transmission systems and storage operations of eqt midstream are regulated by the ferc and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the ferc for instance the ferc approves tariffs that establish the partnership’s rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service to the partnership’s customers the fees or rates established under the partnership’s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority over transmission operations also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

  

  

in july 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the new legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act required the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation as of the filing date of this annual report the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other cftc rules that may be relevant to the company have yet to be proposed or finalized and in some cases finalized rules have yet to be implemented because significant cftc rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the new regulations on the company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company anticipates however increased compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

  

regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the us congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 

  

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public pollution site remediation and preservation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife and the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing including drilling operating and abandoning wells pipelines and related facilities 

  

the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations the company conducts baseline and as appropriate postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of our drilling pads legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells 

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation effective january 1 2011 the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emissions by subjecting new facilities and major modifications to existing facilities that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to the permitting requirements of the federal clean air act in addition the us congress has been considering bills that would establish a capandtrade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental 

  

  

compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 

  

employees 

  

the company and its subsidiaries had 1621 employees at the end of 2013 and none are subject to a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas regional basis differentials national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

  

lower natural gas prices may result in decreases in the revenue operating income and cash flow for each of our businesses a reduction in drilling activity and the construction of new transportation capacity and downward adjustments to the value of oil and gas properties which may cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings moreover if we fail to control our operating costs during periods of lower natural gas prices we could further reduce our operating income a reduction in operating income or cash flow will reduce our funds available for capital expenditures and correspondingly our opportunities for growth we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value 

  

increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased enduser conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

  

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation and storage of natural gas and ngls such as well site blowouts cratering and explosions pipe and other equipment and system failures uncontrolled flows of natural gas or well fluids fires formations with abnormal pressures pollution and environmental risks and natural disasters we also face various security risks including cyber security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information render data or systems unusable or otherwise disrupt our business operations and threats to the security of our or third parties’ facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants and pipelines these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment pollution or other environmental damage disruptions to our operations and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in 

  

  

the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

  

our failure to develop obtain or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of gas depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities the capacity of transportation gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells competition for pipeline infrastructure within the region is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could affect our competitive position the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty gas transportation gathering processing and storage facilities which are limited in number geographically concentrated and subject to the same risks identified above with respect to our infrastructure development and maintenance programs because we do not own these thirdparty pipelines or facilities their continuing operation is not within our control an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty pipelines and facilities for any reason including cyberattacks on such pipelines and facilities could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas in such event we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project in addition some of our thirdparty contracts may involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part moreover our usage of third parties for transportation gathering and processing services subjects us to the credit and performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas to market 

  

also our producing properties and operations are limited to the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas as a result we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production caused by transportation capacity constraints curtailment of production availability of equipment facilities personnel or services significant governmental regulation natural disasters adverse weather conditions plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of gas produced from this area 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2014 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activities midstream infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital and evaluated opportunities outside of the appalachian basin notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2014 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies including the appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2014 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

  

  

we periodically engage in acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions these transactions involve various inherent risks such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals and our ability to achieve benefits anticipated to result from acquisition or disposition of the assets in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering and transmission systems and pipelines environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling and pipeline construction environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety including replacement requirements and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business or result in delays due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed governmental approvals and permits these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

  

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transportation and storage businesses are in many cases subject to federal regulation by the ferc which may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances andor expense deferrals 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming in addition to periodic changes to air water and waste laws as well as recent epa initiatives to impose climate changebased air regulations on the industry the us congress and various states have been evaluating climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would further restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

another area of potential regulation is hydraulic fracturing which we utilize to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed or is under discussion at the federal and state levels we cannot predict whether any such federal or state legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how it may affect our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs 

  

recent discussions regarding the federal budget have included proposals which could potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal and collaterally state income taxes of independent producers with the potential repeal of the ability to expense intangible drilling costs having the most significant potential future impact to us these changes if enacted will make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our natural gas resources 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing 

  

  

authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

in july 2010 the us congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivative market and entities such as the company that participate in that market the new legislation known as the doddfrank act required the cftc the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation as of the filing date of this annual report the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including the company such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations other rules that may be relevant to the company or its counterparties have yet to be proposed or finalized and in some cases finalized rules have yet to be implemented because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the new regulations on the company’s hedging program including available counterparties or regulatory compliance obligations the company anticipates however increased compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment 

  

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

  

we rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings 

  

any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity we cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish financial results 

  

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a well is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the gas to market successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect in addition any exploration projects increase the risks inherent in our natural gas activities specifically seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas or other hydrocarbons which could adversely affect the results of our operations because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

  

the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment a qualified work force and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

we also rely on third parties for certain construction drilling and completion services materials and supplies delays or failures to perform by such third parties could adversely impact our earnings cash flows and financial position 

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things oil spills the explosion of natural gas transmission lines and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

  

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 

  

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil and the amount timing and cost of actual production in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngl and oil industry in general 

  

  

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

  

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

stock performance graph 

  

the following graph compares the most recent fiveyear cumulative total return attained by holders of the company’s common stock with the cumulative total returns of the sp 500 index and two customized peer groups of 25 companies the individual companies of the prior customized peer group the “old selfconstructed peer group” and the new customized peer group the “new selfconstructed peer group” are listed below in footnotes a and b respectively an investment of 100 with reinvestment of all dividends is assumed to have been made at the close of business on december 31 2008 in the company’s common stock in the sp 500 index and in each customized peer group relative performance is tracked through december 31 2013 

   

a   the old selfconstructed peer group first used in the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2011 includes 25 companies which are cabot oil  gas corporation chesapeake energy corporation cimarex energy co consol energy inc energen corporation eog resources inc exco resources inc markwest energy partners lp mdu resources group inc national fuel gas company nstar oneok inc penn virginia corporation pioneer natural resources company plains exploration  production company questar corporation quicksilver resources inc range resources corporation sempra energy sm energy company southwestern energy company spectra energy corp ultra petroleum corp whiting petroleum corporation and the williams companies inc nstar was acquired during 2012 and is included in the calculation from december 31 2008 through december 31 2011 at which time it was removed from the peer group calculation plains exploration  production company was acquired during 2013 and is included in the calculation from december 31 2008 through december 31 2012 at which time it was removed from the peer group calculation

consolidated results of continuing operations 

  

2013 eqt highlights included 

  

·   annual production sales volumes of 3782 bcfe 430 higher than 2012 

·   marcellus sales volumes of 2750 bcfe 816 higher than 2012 

·   gathered volumes of 4664 tbtu 391 higher than 2012 

·   increased proved reserves by 39 to 83 tcfe 

·   completed an underwritten public offering of common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership 

·   completed the equitable gas transaction 

  

income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2013 was 2987 million 197 per diluted share compared with 1359 million 090 per diluted share in 2012 the 1628 million increase in income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation between periods was primarily attributable to a 43 increase in natural gas volumes sold increases in contracted transmission capacity and throughput and gathered volumes the disposal of certain energy marketing contracts by eqt energy in december 2013 and lower interest expense these factors were partially offset by higher depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense higher income tax expense higher selling general and administrative sga expense and higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of the partnership 

  

operating income was 6546 million in 2013 compared to 3896 million in 2012 an increase of 2650 million the increase in operating income was attributable to a 43 increase in natural gas volumes sold increased transmission pipeline revenues and gathered volumes and a 196 million pretax gain from the disposal of customer contracts by eqt energy partially offset by higher dda expense and higher sga expense 

  

production sales volumes increased primarily as a result of increased production from the 2012 and 2013 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the average effective sales price to eqt corporation for production sales volumes was 413 per mcfe in 2013 compared to 417 per mcfe in 2012 the average nymex natural gas index price increased to 365 per mcf in 2013 from 279 per mcf for 2012 hedging activities resulted in an increase in the effective sales price of 036 per mcf in 2013 compared to 110 per mcf in 2012 the 074 per mcf decrease in the impact of hedging activities in 2013 was the result of the differential in the nymex natural gas index prices between periods and the lower average hedge prices in 2013 gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 39 increase in gathered volumes partially offset by a 17 decrease in the average gathering fee the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play the decrease in the average gathering fee resulted from increased gathered volumes in the marcellus play as the marcellus gathering rate is lower than the rate in other areas 

  

operating expenses for 2013 were 12270 million compared to 9876 million in 2012 an increase of 2394 million this increase was primarily attributable to higher dda charges attributable to higher production volumes at a production depletion rate of 150 per mcfe compared to 152 per mcfe in 2012 and higher productionrelated and sga costs consistent with the growth in the production and midstream businesses 

  

on july 22 2013 the partnership completed an underwritten public offering of 12650000 common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership following the offering and the closing of the sunrise merger the company holds a 446 equity interest in the partnership which includes 3443902 common units 17339718 subordinated units and a 2 general partner interest the partnership received net proceeds of 5294 million from the offering after deducting the underwriters’ discount and offering expenses of 209 million the company continues to consolidate the results of the partnership the company records the noncontrolling interest of the public limited partners in its financial statements 

  

on december 17 2013 the company and its whollyowned subsidiary holdco completed the previously announced transactions contemplated by the master purchase agreement pursuant to which the company and holdco 

  

  

transferred 100 of their ownership interests in equitable gas and homeworks to png companies as consideration for the transaction the company received a cash payment of 7406 million which is subject to certain postclosing adjustments select midstream assets including the avc facilities with a preliminary estimated fair value of approximately 1414 million and other contractual assets with a preliminary estimated fair value of 325 million 

  

income from continuing operations attributable to eqt corporation for 2012 was 1359 million 090 per diluted share compared with 4196 million 279 per diluted share in 2011 in 2011 the company recorded 2029 million of pretax gains on dispositions related to the sales of the big sandy pipeline big sandy and langley the company was negatively impacted in 2012 by lower realized sales prices for production sales volumes higher dda expense and higher interest expense partially offset by increases in both production and gathered volumes and lower income tax expense 

  

operating income was 3896 million in 2012 compared to 7612 million in 2011 a decrease of 3716 million in addition to the 2029 million pretax gain in 2011 on the dispositions of big sandy and langley the decrease from 2011 was a result of approximately 24 lower realized sales prices for production sales volumes a 22 higher production depletion rate and higher other operating expenses partially offset by a 33 increase in production volumes a 30 increase in gathering volumes and higher transmission revenues 

  

production sales volumes increased primarily as a result of increased production from the 2011 and 2012 drilling programs in the marcellus acreage this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the average effective sales price to eqt corporation including the effect of the company’s hedging program was 417 per mcfe in 2012 compared to 523 per mcfe in 2011 hedging activities resulted in an increase in the average natural gas sales price of 110 per mcf in 2012 and 051 per mcf in 2011 gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 30 increase in gathered volumes partially offset by a 7 decrease in the average gathering fee the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play 

  

operating expenses for 2012 were 9876 million compared to 7656 million in 2011 an increase of 2220 million this increase was primarily attributable to higher dda charges from higher production volumes at a production depletion rate of 152 per mcfe compared to 125 per mcfe in 2011 and higher productionrelated and sga costs consistent with the growth in the production and midstream businesses 

  

on july 2 2012 the partnership completed its ipo of 14375000 common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership which represented 406 of the partnership’s outstanding equity the company retained a 594 equity interest in the partnership including 2964718 common units 17339718 subordinated units and a 2 general partner interest

outlook 

  

the company is committed to profitably developing its natural gas ngl and oil reserves through environmentally responsible costeffective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling the market price for natural gas can be volatile and these fluctuations can impact the company’s revenues earnings and liquidity the company is unable to predict future movements in the market price for natural gas and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations however the company monitors the market for natural gas and adjusts its strategy and operations appropriately due to the increased supply of natural gas in the united states northeast region pricing relative to henry hub was negative during the second half of 2013 the company expects this trend in basis to continue to be negative 

  

total capital investment excluding acquisitions is expected to be approximately 25 billion in 2014 capital spending for well development primarily drilling in 2014 is expected to be approximately 19 billion to support the drilling of approximately 357 gross wells including 186 marcellus wells 120 huron wells 30 upper devonian wells and 21 wells in the utica shale of ohio estimated sales volumes are expected to be 460 – 480 bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 24 in 2014 while ngl volumes are expected to be 6800 – 6900 mbbls to support continued growth in production the company plans to invest approximately 610 million on midstream infrastructure in 2014 and expects to add approximately 440 mmcf per day of incremental gathering capacity and approximately 750 mmcf per day of transmission capacity the 2014 capital spending plan is expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow generated from operations and proceeds from midstream asset sales dropdowns to the partnership

security ratings and financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the company at december 31 2013 changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm and longterm debt including interest rates and fees under its lines of credit collateral requirements under derivative instruments and access to the credit markets 

  

   

the company’s credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company’s ratings particularly below investment grade the company’s access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits on derivative contracts would increase counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease the required margin on derivative instruments is also subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the company 

  

the company’s debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that if not complied with could result in termination of the agreements require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions the most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debttototal capitalization ratio limitations on transactions with affiliates insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s credit facility contains financial covenants that require a total debttototal capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income oci as of december 31 2013 the company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants 

  

the partnership’s credit facility contains various provisions that if not complied with could result in termination of the credit facility require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions the most significant covenants and events of default under the credit facility relate to maintenance of permitted leverage coverage and interest coverage ratios limitations on transactions with affiliates insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions under the credit facility the partnership is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 500 to 100 or after the partnership obtains an investment grade rating not more than 550 to 100 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions and until the partnership obtains an investment grade rating a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 300 to 100 as of december 31 2013 the partnership was in compliance with all credit facility provisions and covenants 

  

  

commodity risk management 

  

the substantial majority of the company’s commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the company’s produced natural gas the company’s overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company’s risk management program may include the use of exchangetraded natural gas futures contracts and options and otc natural gas swap agreements and options collectively derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily nymex swaps collars and futures the company also enters into fixed price natural gas sales agreements that are satisfied by physical delivery the company’s fixed price natural gas sales agreements include contracts that fix only the nymex portion of the price and contracts that fix nymex and basis 

  

as of february 13 2014 the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s hedge position for 2014 through 2016 production were 

  

   

a   the average price is based on a conversion rate of 105 mmbtumcf 

b   for 2016 the company executed a natural gas sales agreement for approximately 35 bcf that includes a nymex ceiling price of 488 per mcf 

  

see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s hedging program 

  

other items 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005 the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco the savings guarantees provided that once the energyefficiency construction was completed by noresco the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately 172 million as of december 31 2013 extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 14 years 

  

in exchange for the company’s agreement to maintain these guarantee obligations the purchaser of the noresco business and noresco agreed among other things that noresco would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and agreed to reimburse the company for any loss under the guarantee obligations provided that the purchaser’s reimbursement obligation will not exceed 6 million in the aggregate and will expire on november 18 2014 in 2008 the original purchaser of noresco sold its interest in noresco and transferred its obligations to a third party in connection with that event the new owner delivered to the company a 1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations 

  

the noresco guarantees are exempt from asc topic 460 guarantees the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

  

  

rate regulation 

  

as described under “regulation” in item 1 “business” the company’s transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of rate regulation as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

   

purchase obligations are commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines some of which extend up to approximately 15 years the company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program the obligations for the company’s various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately 639 million as of december 31 2013 the company has agreements with savanna drilling llc pioneer drilling company and patterson drilling company to provide drilling equipment and services to the company over the next three years these obligations totaled approximately 704 million as of december 31 2013 

  

as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013 of 571 million of which 98 million is offset against deferred tax assets since it would primarily reduce the related nol carryover and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s commitments and contingencies 

  

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities under this method all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves if an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit the depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred the company estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from its oil and gas properties and compares these estimates to the carrying values of the properties the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on riskadjusted proved and in some cases probable reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable those properties would be written down to fair value which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

  

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made undeveloped properties had a net book value of 4502 million and 3856 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which can be significantly impacted by management’s expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans should the company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among 

  

  

other things reservoir performance development plans prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the 12month period operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans and pension and other postretirement benefits recorded in oci the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state nol carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if this step is satisfied then the company must measure the tax position the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement see note 9 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

  

derivative instruments   the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales and natural gas inventory and a limited number of interest rate swaps and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and basis swaps to protect from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices energy trading contracts are also utilized to leverage assets and limit exposure to shifts in market prices derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value if the derivative qualifies and is designated for cash flow hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated oci a component of equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings for fair value hedges the company also records the change in the fair value of the hedged item inventory in the statements of consolidated income the company dedesignated all derivative commodity instruments that were designated and qualified as fair value hedges effective october 1 2013 see “commodity risk management” above item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding hedging activities 

  

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use as inputs marketbased parameters including but not limited to forward curves discount rates broker quotes volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a riskfree instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

a substantial majority of the company’s derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be dedesignated the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings which could materially impact the results of operations one of the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged effectiveness may be impacted by various factors including changes in basis and counterparty credit ratings because most of the company’s derivative instruments hedge natural gas prices at nymex but most of the company’s physical sales are at appalachian basin pricing changes in basis may result in ineffectiveness of the instruments counterparty credit ratings may impact ineffectiveness as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective the company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit fundamentals credit ratings credit default swap rates and market activity 

  

in addition the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements given the company’s price risk management position and price volatility the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices both nymex and basis by changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in basis and estimates of nonperformance risk and by changes in margin requirements future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company 

  

  

considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are spud upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company increases the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock and stock options awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units 

  

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards awards under the 2011 value driver award program which were paid out in cash on december 31 2012 were treated as liability awards phantom units which vest upon grant expected to be satisfied in cash are also treated as liability awards for liability awards the company is required to estimate on grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through and value of the company’s common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award in the case of a performancebased award and until payment in the case of phantom units the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

  

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock or partnership common units are treated as equity awards awards under the 2011 volume and efficiency program the 2012 executive performance incentive program the 2012 value driver award program the 2013 executive performance incentive program the 2013 value driver award program and the eqm total return program which remained outstanding at december 31 2013 are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend or distribution yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend or distribution yield is based on the historical dividend or distribution yield of the company’s common stock or the partnership’s common units as applicable and any changes expected thereto and where applicable of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock or the partnership’s common units and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

  

  

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period historically three years for phantom units which vest on date of grant expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company’s financial statements in the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based upon the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

  

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically two years the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s common stock future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s sharebased compensation 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls which can affect the operating results of the company primarily at eqt production and the storage marketing and other activities at eqt midstream the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of these institutions is regularly monitored the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge natural gas inventory and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

commodity price risk 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk and to hedge natural gas inventory which is exposed to changes in fair value most of which are hedged at nymex natural gas prices the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels the company does not enter into natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

  

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company also considers other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

  

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the company hedged portions of expected equity production portions of forecasted purchases and sales and portions of natural gas inventory by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 388 bcf and 356 bcf of natural gas respectively see the “commodity risk management” section in the “capital resources and liquidity” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2013 and 2012 levels would increase the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1517 million and 1310 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2013 and 2012 levels would decrease the fair value of natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1516 million and 1302 million respectively 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 the price change was then applied to the natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted production approximates a portion of the company’s expected physical sales of natural gas therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge the company’s forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on the company’s physical sales of natural gas assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk the anticipated transactions occur as expected and basis does not significantly change 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company and the partnership earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates the company and the partnership pay on borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities all of the company’s longterm borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s borrowings and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have limited credit risk because cftc regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from potential financial instability of the exchange members the company’s otc swap and collar derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole 

  

  

the company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures these include closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 79 or 1074 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2013 had a positive fair value approximately 80 or 3030 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts at december 31 2012 had a positive fair value

 item 1   business 

  

general 

  

eqt corporation eqt or the company conducts its business through three business segments eqt production eqt midstream and distribution eqt production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the appalachian basin with 60 tcfe of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves across approximately 35 million gross acres including approximately 540000 gross acres in the marcellus play as of december 31 2012 eqt midstream provides gathering transmission and storage services for the company’s produced gas as well as for independent third parties across the appalachian basin the distribution segment distributes and sells natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers through the company’s regulated distribution subsidiary equitable gas company llc equitable gas as a local distribution company equitable gas has customers in southwestern pennsylvania west virginia and eastern kentucky equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania and provides offsystem sales activities that include the purchase and delivery of natural gas 

  

key events in 2012 

  

in january 2012 eqt announced it would indefinitely suspend development of its huron assets in favor of investing in its higher return marcellus play the decision was based on lower commodity pricing of natural gas which resulted in a reduction in projected cash flow a similar decision was made in december 2010 when the company suspended the development of its cbm play in virginia the company includes only proved developed reserves in these fields in its determination of proved reserves the company expects to continue to produce from existing wells in the huron and cbm plays however contributions to the company’s total production sales volumes will gradually decline as the company focuses the majority of its future drilling program in the marcellus play the huron and cbm plays accounted for approximately 42 of production sales volumes in 2012 and are expected to account for approximately 27 of production sales volumes in 2013 

  

on february 13 2012 eqt filed a registration statement with the sec for an ipo of common units in a master limited partnership known as eqt midstream partners lp the partnership eqt pursued this strategy as a means of raising capital to further enhance and accelerate its economically attractive drilling and development programs as well as to provide eqt midstream with capital to continue pursuing additional opportunities on july 2 2012 the partnership completed its underwritten ipo of 14375000 common units at 2100 per unit nyse eqm eqt received net cash proceeds of approximately 231 million upon closing of the ipo and retained a 574 limited partner interest and a 2 general partner interest in the partnership prior to the ipo the company contributed to the partnership 100 of equitrans lp equitrans the company’s fercregulated transmission storage and gathering subsidiary an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of eqt serves as the general partner of the partnership and the company continues to operate the equitrans business pursuant to contractual arrangements signed in conjunction with the ipo eqt records the noncontrolling interest of the public limited partners in eqt’s financial statements 

  

on december 19 2012 eqt and its direct whollyowned subsidiary distribution holdco llc holdco executed a master purchase agreement with png companies llc png companies the parent company of peoples natural gas company llc peoples to transfer 100 ownership of equitable gas and equitable homeworks llc homeworks to png companies as part of the transfer eqt will receive cash proceeds of 720 million subject to adjustment select midstream assets and commercial arrangements with png companies and its affiliates homeworks and equitable gas are direct whollyowned subsidiaries of holdco peoples is a portfolio company of steelriver infrastructure partners the transaction is subject to various conditions including receipt of the approval of the pa puc the wv psc the ky psc and the ferc the transaction is also subject to review under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act the agreements provide that such approvals and review must be complete by december 19 2013 subject to certain extension rights these approvals and review may not be received or completed within the time allowed 

  

  

eqt production business segment 

  

eqt believes that it is a technology leader in extended lateral horizontal drilling in the appalachian basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new drilling and completion technology which increases lateral length drilled and reserves per foot of pay the company’s strategy is to maximize value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure and profitably developing its undeveloped marcellus reserves eqt’s proved reserves increased by 12 in 2012 to a total of 60 tcfe primarily across the marcellus and huron shale plays and including cbm and other vertical wells the company’s marcellus assets contribute approximately 43 tcfe in total proved reserves 

  

the following illustrations depict the southwestern portion of the marcellus shale formation top left while the larger map highlights eqt’s acreage position within the marcellus 

  

  

  

as of december 31 2012 the company’s proved reserves are as follows 

  

  

   

 includes the lower huron cleveland berea sandstone and other devonian age formations also included in the huron play is 620 bcfe of reserves from nonshale formations accessed through vertical wells 

  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk with long lives and low development and production costs assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2012 the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by 2012 produced volumes is 23 years 

  

the company invested approximately 857 million on well development in 2012 and production sales volumes increased 33 compared to 2011 capital spending for eqt production is expected to be approximately 115 billion in 2013 the majority of which will be used to support the drilling of approximately 172 gross wells including 153 marcellus wells 11 upper devonian wells and eight wells in the utica shale of ohio production sales volumes are expected to be approximately 31 higher for 2013 with a range expected between 335 and 340 bcfe including 3900 – 4000 mbbls of ngl production over the past three years the company’s wells drilled and related capital expenditures for well development were 

  

   

   

eqt midstream business segment 

  

during 2012 the company completed various gathering line expansion projects and had a yearend gathering capacity of 1115 mmcf per day an increase of approximately 455 mmcf per day from 2011 with approximately 10300 miles of gathering lines eqt has marcellus gathering capacity of 765 mmcf per day in pennsylvania and 350 mmcf per day in west virginia to support the growth of production in the marcellus play eqt midstream plans to add approximately 400 mmcf per day of incremental 

  

  

gathering capacity in 2013 all in pennsylvania see the map below left for a depiction of eqt’s gathering lines and compressor stations in relationship to the overall marcellus shale formation 

  

the company’s transmission and storage system includes a fercregulated interstate pipeline system of approximately 700 miles that connects to five interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies and is supported by 14 associated natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 400 mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 32 bcf of working gas capacity the map below right is a depiction of eqt’s transmission lines storage pools and compressor stations in relationship to the overall marcellus shale formation equitrans includes among other things the 2010 marcellus expansion project completed in december 2010 and the sunrise pipeline which equitrans operates under a lease from an eqt affiliate eqt’s storage reservoirs are clustered in two geographic areas connected to its equitrans pipeline with eight in northern west virginia and six in southwestern pennsylvania during 2012 the company completed construction of the sunrise pipeline blacksville compressor station and braden run interconnect projects resulting in 700 mmcf per day of increased transmission capacity during 2013 eqt midstream expects to add approximately 450 mmcf per day of incremental transmission capacity through the morris iii interconnect expansion and the low pressure east uprate projects for a total of 2150 mmcf per day by the end of 2013 

  

in 2012 the partnership was formed by eqt corporation to own operate acquire and develop midstream assets in the appalachian basin the partnership provides midstream services to eqt and other thirdparty companies through its two primary assets its transmission and storage system and its gathering system the partnership owns the approximately 700 mile fercregulated interstate pipeline system as well as approximately 2000 miles of fercregulated lowpressure gathering lines eqt retained a 574 limited partner interest and a 2 general partner interest in the partnership whose results are consolidated in the company’s financial results 

  

  

  

eqt also has a gas marketing subsidiary eqt energy llc eqt energy which provides optimization of capacity and storage assets ngl sales and gas sales to commercial and industrial customers within its operational footprint through 49 bcf of leased storagerelated assets and approximately 1100000 dth per day of thirdparty contractual pipeline capacity 

  

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure profitably developing its undeveloped marcellus reserves and effectively and efficiently utilizing its extensive gathering and transmission assets that are uniquely positioned in the marcellus shale and in close proximity to the northeastern united states markets 

  

the company continues to improve its use of technology by increasing lateral lengths reducing cluster spacing and developing multiwell pads eqt expects to continue increasing the average lateral lengths over time however lateral lengths will be limited by lease boundaries in the marcellus play unless the company is able to pool acreage with neighboring leaseholders because substantially all of the company’s acreage is held by production or in fee eqt production is able to develop its acreage in the most economical manner through the use of longer laterals and multiwell pads as opposed to being required to drill lesseconomical wells in order to retain acreage the use of longer laterals and multiwell pads has the additional benefit of reducing the surface environmental footprint of the company’s drilling 

  

  

the company believes the location of its midstream assets across a wide area of the marcellus play in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia is a competitive advantage which uniquely positions it for growth in light of the growth of eqt production and other producers in the marcellus play eqt midstream intends to capitalize on the growing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in the region especially the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia the 2013 gathering and transmission investments are expected to provide a platform for growth mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the company’s gathering and transmission systems 

  

in july 2012 the company formed the partnership which is a growthoriented master limited partnership designed to own operate acquire and develop midstream assets in the appalachian basin through pursuing accretive acquisitions from the company capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities and attracting additional thirdparty volumes the partnership is expected to provide an ongoing source of capital to the company 

  

the company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas with the assistance of a 700000 grant received from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the company opened a publicaccess natural gas fueling station in pittsburgh pennsylvania during 2011 investment breakeven is expected during 2013 and plans are underway for an expansion of the station in conjunction with this project the company is promoting the use of natural gas fleet vehicles including its own eqt plans to operate 14 of its vehicle fleet more than 200 vehicles on natural gas by the end of 2013 in addition the company converted two drilling rigs to utilize natural gas in 2012 with an additional two to three expected by the end of 2013

markets and customers 

  

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of revenues in 2012 2011 or 2010 

  

natural gas sales   eqt’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas can be volatile as demonstrated by significant declines in late 2011 and early 2012 changes in the market price for natural gas impact the company’s revenues earnings and liquidity the company is unable to predict potential future movements in the market price for natural gas and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations however the company monitors the market for natural gas and adjusts strategy and operations as deemed appropriate in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

ngl sales   the company sells ngls from its own production through the eqt production segment and from gas marketed for third parties by eqt midstream until february 2011 when the company sold its langley natural gas processing complex langley the company processed natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas ngls were recovered at langley and transported to a fractionation plant owned by a third party for separation into commercial components the third party marketed these components for a fee the company also had contractual processing arrangements whereby the company sold gas to a thirdparty processor at a weighted average liquids component price subsequent to the closing of the sale of langley to markwest energy partners lp in february 2011 the processing of the company’s produced natural gas has been performed by a thirdparty vendor 

  

the following table presents the wellhead sales price on an average mcfe basis to eqt corporation for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without hedges for the years ended december 31 

  

   

  

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to four major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company dominion transmission and tennessee gas pipeline company the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to geographically diverse markets 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2012 totaled 3354 bbtu of which approximately 77 related to gathering for eqt production 13 related to thirdparty volumes and 10 related to volumes for other affiliates of the company revenues from eqt production and other affiliates accounted for approximately 88 of 2012 gathering revenues 

  

natural gas transmission storage and marketing services offered by eqt include commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services these operations are executed using company owned and operated transmission and underground storage facilities as well as other contractual capacity arrangements with major pipeline and storage service providers in the eastern united states eqt energy uses leased storage capacity and firm transportation capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities when available eqt energy also engages in risk management and energy trading activities the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets 

  

customers of eqt midstream’s gas transportation storage risk management and related services are affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and ugi energy services inc eqt energy’s commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services are offered to natural gas producers and energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers 

  

equitrans’ firm transportation contracts expire between 2013 and 2023 the company anticipates that the capacity associated with these expiring contracts will be remarketed or used by affiliates such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed in 2012 approximately 84 of transportation volumes and 81 of revenues were from affiliates 

  

natural gas distribution the company’s distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 277400 customers consisting of 258500 residential customers and 18900 commercial and industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia distribution’s service areas have a rather static population and economy 

  

equitable gas purchases gas through contracts with various sources including major and independent producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate the gas purchase contracts contain various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices the cost of purchased gas is equitable gas’ largest operating expense and is passed through to customers utilizing mechanisms approved by the pa puc wv psc and ky psc equitable gas is not permitted to profit from fluctuations in gas costs and does not purchase gas produced by eqt production in order to maintain certain federal tax benefits for eqt 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 67 of calendar year 2012 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during the offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

  

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and 

  

  

operators key competitors for new gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies eqt competes with numerous other companies offering the natural gas marketing services some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers as a regulated utility equitable gas’ distribution operation experiences only limited competition with other local distribution companies in its operating area but experiences usage pressures as a result of alternative fuels and conservation 

  

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations may affect the costs and timing of developing the company’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties both kentucky and virginia allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration while in west virginia and pennsylvania it is necessary to rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas 

  

eqt midstream’s transmission and gathering operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may affect the costs of or increase the time of developing new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

  

eqt midstream has both nonregulated and regulated operations the interstate natural gas transmission systems and storage operations are regulated by the ferc and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the ferc for instance the ferc approves tariffs that establish equitrans’ rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service to equitrans’ customers the fees or rates established under equitrans’ tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority over transmission and gathering also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new facilities extension or abandonment of services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

  

eqt production and eqt midstream each engage in natural gas hedging activities which include swaps and other derivatives that are regulated by among others the cftc in july 2010 congress enacted the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act that among other things established federal oversight and regulation of swaps and certain entities that participate in swap markets the doddfrank act authorized the cftc to develop comprehensive regulation for types of swaps the company may use among the most significant provisions of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of such swaps on regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities in each case subject to certain key exceptions the doddfrank act also required the registration and comprehensive oversight of swap dealers which may act as swap counterparties to eqt production and eqt midstream 

  

  

in october 2012 joint rules of the cftc and the sec defining “swap” became effective and enabled the cftc to begin implementing the new regulatory framework for swaps as of the date of this report the cftc has adopted many final rules that will impose regulatory obligations on all market participants including eqt production and eqt midstream compliance with many of these new rules will be phased in throughout 2013 and into at least 2014 the new rules may be directly applicable to eqt production and eqt midstream or may have an indirect effect where the rules apply to eqt production and eqt midstream’s counterparties which may include registered swap dealers other cftc rules that may be relevant to eqt production and eqt midstream have yet to be finalized because many cftc final rules do not have final compliance dates and other rules are still at the proposal stage it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the doddfrank act and new regulations on the company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations the company anticipates however increased compliance costs and significant changes to current market practices as participants adapt to a new regulatory environment 

  

equitable gas’ distribution rates terms of service and certain contracts with affiliates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the wv psc the field line sales rates in kentucky are subject to rate regulation by the ky psc 

  

equitable gas must usually seek the approval of one or more of its regulators prior to changing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and transportation activities equitable gas is provided an opportunity to recover a return in addition to the costs of its distribution and gathering delivery activities however equitable gas’ regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term 

  

as required by pennsylvania law equitable gas has a customer assistance program that assists lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the cost of this program is recovered through rates charged to other residential customers 

  

regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the us congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 

  

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public and the pollution preservation remediation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife or the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing including drilling operating and abandoning wells pipelines and related facilities in most instances the regulatory frameworks relate to the handling of drilling production and processing materials and emissions the disposal of drilling production and processing wastes the protection of water and air and the protection of people and aquatic life 

  

the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in 

  

  

formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers to assess water sources near our drilling locations we conduct baseline and postdrilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2500 feet of our drilling pads legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells 

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation effective january 1 2011 the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emissions by subjecting new facilities and major modifications to existing facilities that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to the permitting requirements of the federal clean air act in addition the us congress has been considering bills that would establish a capandtrade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering processing and storage facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

  

lower natural gas prices may result in decreases in the revenue margin and cash flow for each of our businesses a reduction in drilling activity and the construction of new transportation capacity and downward adjustments to the value of oil and gas properties which may cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings moreover if we fail to control our operating costs during periods of lower natural gas prices we could further reduce our margin a reduction in margin or cash flow will reduce our funds available for capital expenditures and correspondingly our opportunities for growth we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value 

  

increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap collar and option agreements and exchangetraded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

  

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation storage and distribution of natural gas and ngls such as well site blowouts cratering and explosions pipe and other equipment and system failures uncontrolled flows of natural gas or well fluids fires formations with abnormal pressures pollution and environmental risks and natural disasters we also face various security risks including cyber security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or render data or systems unusable and threats to the security of our or third parties’ facilities and infrastructure such as processing plants and pipelines these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment pollution or other environmental damage and loss of sensitive confidential information moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance 

  

  

that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

  

our failure to develop obtain or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of gas depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities in the marcellus play the capacity of transportation gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells competition for pipeline infrastructure within the region is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could affect our competitive position the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty gas transportation gathering processing and storage facilities which are limited in number geographically concentrated and subject to the same risks identified above with respect to our infrastructure development and maintenance programs because we do not own these thirdparty pipelines or facilities their continuing operation is not within our control an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty pipelines and facilities could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas in such event we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project in addition some of our thirdparty contracts may involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part moreover our usage of third parties for transportation gathering and processing services subjects us to the credit and performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas to market 

  

also our producing properties and operations are limited to the appalachian basin making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas as a result we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production caused by transportation capacity constraints curtailment of production availability of equipment facilities personnel or services significant governmental regulation natural disasters adverse weather conditions plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of gas produced from this area 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2013 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activities midstream infrastructure distribution infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2013 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies including the appropriate rate of reserve development or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2013 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

  

on december 19 2012 we signed an agreement to transfer equitable gas company to png companies in exchange for 720 million in cash subject to adjustment and select midstream assets and commercial arrangements acquisitions dispositions and other strategic transactions involve various inherent risks such as our 

  

  

ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals and our ability to achieve benefits anticipated to result from acquisition or disposition of the assets in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering systems pipelines and distribution systems environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling and pipeline construction environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety including replacement requirements and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business or result in delays due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed governmental approvals and permits these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

  

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are in many cases subject to state or federal regulation the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming for instance several initiatives aimed at greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution have recently been enacted or are being considered on january 1 2011 the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emissions by subjecting new facilities and major modifications to existing facilities that emit large emissions of greenhouse gas emissions to the permitting requirements of the federal clean air act 

  

moreover the us congress and various states have been evaluating climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

additionally on april 7 2012 the epa issued final rules that subject all oil and gas operations production processing transmission storage and distribution to regulation under the new source performance standards nsps and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap programs the epa’s rules also include nsps standards for the completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured the rules under neshap include maximum achievable control technology standards for certain equipment not currently subject to such standards compliance with these initiatives and rules could result in an increase to our costs or require changes that reduce our production 

  

another area of potential regulation is hydraulic fracturing which we utilize to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations 

  

  

may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed or is under discussion at the federal and state levels we cannot predict whether any such federal or state legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how it may impact our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs 

  

recent discussions regarding the federal budget have included proposals which could potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal and collaterally state income taxes of independent producers with the potential repeal of the ability to expense intangible drilling costs having the most significant potential future impact to us these changes if enacted will make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our natural gas resources 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability 

  

in july 2010 congress enacted the wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act that among other things authorized the cftc to develop comprehensive regulation for the swap markets the doddfrank act created a new structure for trading otc swaps a market in which we are currently a market participant among other things the doddfrank act established mandatory clearing of certain standardized swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trade execution of those swaps on regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities in each case subject to certain key exceptions the cftc’s new regulatory regime requires the registration and comprehensive oversight of swap dealers the cftc has finalized new rules directly applicable to eqt production and eqt midstream in addition the cftc’s finalized new rules may have an indirect effect on eqt production and eqt midstream’s counterparties which may include registered swap dealers as of the date of this report certain cftc rules that may be relevant to eqt production and eqt midstream remain in the proposal stage furthermore there is ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding compliance dates for finalized cftc rules throughout 2012 the cftc repeatedly delayed compliance dates for numerous new rules other cftc rules have also been challenged by industry groups in federal court further adding to regulatory uncertainty 

  

we anticipate that the cftc rules will increase regulatory compliance costs for eqt production and eqt midstream additionally any counterparties of eqt production or eqt midstream that register as swap dealers will be required to comply with substantial and burdensome new regulatory obligations compliance costs incurred by these swap dealers may make it more expensive for entities that hedge such as eqt production and eqt midstream to hedge their risks with swaps accordingly it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the doddfrank act and new regulatory regime on our hedging program it is possible however that the doddfrank act and regulatory regime for swaps will make hedging more expensive uneconomic or unavailable which could lead to increased costs or commodity price volatility or a combination of both 

  

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

  

we rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings 

  

any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity we cannot be sure that our current ratings will 

  

  

remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish financial results 

  

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a well is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the gas to market successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect in addition any exploration projects increase the risks inherent in our natural gas activities specifically seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas or other hydrocarbons which could adversely affect the results of our operations because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title and property access problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

we also rely on third parties for certain construction drilling and completion services materials and supplies delays or failures to perform by such third parties could adversely impact our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things oil spills the explosion of natural gas transmission lines and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new local state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

  

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

  

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 

  

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil and the amount timing and cost of actual production in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngl and oil industry in general 

  

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

  

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

 item 2 properties 

  

principal facilities are owned or in the case of certain office locations warehouse buildings and equipment leased by the company’s business segments the majority of the company’s properties are located on or under i private properties owned in fee held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles or ii public highways under franchises or permits from various governmental authorities the company’s facilities are generally well maintained and where appropriate are replaced or expanded to meet operating requirements 

  

  

eqt production   eqt production’s properties are located primarily in pennsylvania west virginia kentucky and virginia this segment has approximately 35 million gross acres approximately 62 of which are considered undeveloped which encompass substantially all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil production properties approximately 540000 of these gross acres are located in the marcellus play although most of its wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths 2000 to 8000 feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2012 the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 6004 bcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 2735 bcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 63 bcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 3206 bcfe substantially all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves are prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for preparing the reserve report and the technical aspects of the reserves audit received a bachelor’s degree in petroleum and natural gas engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has 24 years of experience in the oil and gas industry to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally division of interest and production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve reconciliation between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves is audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp ryder scott which is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally ryder scott reviewed 100 of the total net gas and liquid hydrocarbon proved reserves attributable to the company’s interests as of december 31 2012 ryder scott conducted a detailed well by well audit of the company’s largest properties this audit covered 80 of the company’s proved reserves ryder scott’s audit of the remaining 20 of the company’s properties consisted of an audit of aggregated groups not exceeding 200 wells per group ryder scott’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 9901 

  

no report has been filed with any federal authority or agency reflecting a 5 or more difference from the company’s estimated total reserves additional information relating to the company’s estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows is provided in note 21 unaudited to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in 2012 the company commenced drilling operations “spud” or “drilled” on 127 gross horizontal wells with an aggregate of approximately 700000 feet of pay in the marcellus play total proved reserves in the marcellus play increased 25 to 43 tcfe in 2012 primarily as a result of the company’s 2012 drilling program in the huron play the company drilled 7 gross horizontal wells during 2012 with an aggregate of approximately 37000 feet of pay total proved reserves in the huron play including vertical nonshale formations decreased approximately 11 to 16 tcfe as the company has indefinitely ceased development in the huron play and plans to focus its capital expenditures during the next five years on developing the marcellus play the company did not drill any gross cbm wells in 2012 the cbm play had total proved reserves of 01 tcfe at december 31 2012 slightly down from 2011 natural gas production sales volumes in 2012 from the marcellus huron and cbm plays were 1505 bcfe 949 bcfe and 131 bcfe respectively over the past three years the company has experienced a 99 developmental drilling success rate

the company’s average per unit production cost excluding production taxes of natural gas and crude oil during 2012 2011 and 2010 was 018 020 and 024 per mcfe respectively at december 31 2012 the company had approximately 51 multiple completion wells 

  

   

summary of proved oil and gas reserves as of december 31 2012 based on average fiscal year prices 

  

   

   

as of december 31 2012 the company did not have any reserves that have been classified as proved undeveloped reserves for more than five years 

  

certain lease and acquisition agreements require the company to drill a specific number of wells in 2013 a drilling obligation exists to drill 2 wells in the lower huron formation and approximately 20000 gross undeveloped acres could expire if this obligation is not met within the marcellus formation the company is required to drill 5 wells in 2013 and could incur the potential loss of approximately 14000 gross undeveloped acres if this obligation is not met the company intends to satisfy such requirements either directly through its 2013 development program or indirectly by contracting with a third party to do so including through an assignment of the lease farmout or other arrangement 

  

  

as of december 31 2012 leases associated with approximately 20000 gross undeveloped acres expire in 2013 if they are not renewed this acreage is in addition to the acreage that may be lost if drilling obligations are not met the company however has an active lease renewal program in areas targeted for development

selected data by state at december 31 2012 unless otherwise noted 

  

   

  

capital expenditures at eqt production totaled 9918 million during 2012 including 1346 million for the acquisition of undeveloped property the company invested approximately 607 million during 2012 converting undeveloped reserves to developed reserves and 250 million on wells still in progress at year end during the year the company converted 159 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves the company had additions to proved developed reserves of 214 bcfe the majority of which were from wells drilled that had not previously been classified as proved downward revisions of 171 bcfe in proved developed reserves were spread across all areas and all plays new proved undeveloped reserves of 1442 bcfe were added during 2012 these reserve extensions and discoveries were mainly due to decreased lateral spacing in one of the company’s greene county pennsylvania fields and additional proved locations in the company’s wetzel and doddridge county west virginia development areas this increase was partially offset by negative revisions of 475 bcfe this reduction was primarily due to the decrease in the average nymex natural gas price for the year and caused certain existing proved undeveloped reserves to become uneconomical in accordance with sec pricing requirements as of december 31 2012 the company’s proved undeveloped reserves totaled 32 tcfe and all were associated with the development of the marcellus play all proved undeveloped drilling locations are expected to be drilled within five years 

  

proved developed nonproducing reserves decreased 401 bcfe during 2012 as compared to 2011 during 2012 the company incurred a higher percentage of its costs on the well completion phase compared to the drilling phase because of longer laterals reduced cluster spacing and multiwell pads as a result the company changed its methodology for classifying wells as proved developed nonproducing reserves until only after the fracturing process has been completed 

  

the company’s 2012 extensions discoveries and other additions resulting from extensions of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery of 1656 bcfe exceeded the 2012 production of 261 bcfe 

  

wells located in kentucky are primarily in huron formations with depths ranging from 2500 feet to 6000 feet wells located in west virginia are primarily in huron and marcellus formations with depths ranging from 2500 feet to 6500 feet wells located in virginia are primarily in cbm formations with depths ranging from 2000 feet to 3000 feet wells located in pennsylvania are primarily in marcellus formations with depths ranging from 5000 feet to 8000 feet

consolidated results of operations 

  

in 2012 eqt highlights included the following 

  

·   record annual production sales volumes of 2585 bcfe 33 higher than 2011 

·   record marcellus sales volumes of 1506 bcfe 85 higher than 2011 

·   record gathered volumes of 3354 tbtu 30 higher than 2011 

·   increased proved reserves by 12 to 60 tcfe 

·   completed the partnership’s ipo 

·   announced an agreement to sell equitable gas 

  

net income attributable to eqt corporation for 2012 was 1834 million 122 per diluted share compared with 4798 million 319 per diluted share in 2011 in 2011 the company recorded 2029 million of pretax gains on dispositions related to the sales of the big sandy pipeline big sandy and langley the company was negatively impacted in 2012 by lower realized sales prices for production sales volumes higher depreciation depletion and amortization dda and higher interest expense partially offset by increases in both production and gathered volumes and lower income tax expense 

  

operating income was 4705 million in 2012 compared to 8613 million in 2011 a decrease of 3908 million in addition to the 2029 million gain in 2011 on the dispositions of big sandy and langley the decrease from 2011 was a result of approximately 25 lower realized sales prices for production sales volumes a 23 higher production depletion rate and higher other operating expenses partially offset by a 33 increase in production volumes a 30 increase in gathering volumes and higher transmission revenues 

  

production sales volumes increased primarily as a result of increased production from the 2011 and 2012 drilling programs in the marcellus play acreage this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the average wellhead sales price to eqt corporation including the effect of the company’s hedging program was 426 per mcfe in 2012 compared to 537 per mcfe in 2011 hedging activities resulted in an increase in the average natural gas sales price of 119 per mcf in 2012 and 055 per mcf in 2011 gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 30 increase in gathered volumes partially offset by a 7 decrease in the average gathering fee the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play 

  

  

operating expenses for 2012 were 11711 million compared to 9815 million in 2011 an increase of 1896 million this increase was primarily attributable to higher dda charges from higher production volumes at a production depletion rate of 154mcfe compared to 125mcfe in 2011 and higher productionrelated and selling general and administrative sga costs consistent with the growth in produced volumes and midstream throughput 

  

on july 2 2012 the partnership a subsidiary of the company completed its ipo of 14375000 common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership which represented 406 of the partnership’s outstanding equity the company retained a 594 equity interest in the partnership including 2964718 common units 17339718 subordinated units and a 2 general partner interest the company continues to consolidate the results of the partnership eqt records the noncontrolling interest of the public limited partners in eqt’s financial statements 

  

eqt’s consolidated net income for 2011 was 4798 million 319 per diluted share compared with 2277 million 157 per diluted share for 2010 in 2011 the company recorded 1283 million of aftertax gains on dispositions related to the sales of langley and big sandy 

  

operating income increased to 8613 million in 2011 from 4705 million in 2010 in addition to the 2029 million gain on the dispositions of big sandy and langley and the absence of revenues and expenses associated with these assets operating income was favorably impacted by increased production sales volumes and higher gathering and transmission revenues which more than offset the increase in operating expenses associated with higher volumes lower storage and marketing net operating revenues and a lower average wellhead sales price to eqt corporation 

  

production sales volumes increased more than 44 in 2011 from 2010 largely associated with the marcellus play as a result of increased production from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells gathered revenues increased as a result of a 32 increase in gathered volumes primarily related to the company’s production growth transmission net revenues increased as a result of higher firm transportation activity and capacity from the equitrans 2010 marcellus expansion project the average wellhead sales price to eqt corporation including the effect of the company’s hedging program was 537 per mcfe in 2011 compared to 562 per mcfe in 2010 hedging activities resulted in an increase in the average natural gas sales price of 055 per mcf in both 2011 and 2010 

  

operating expenses for 2011 increased 776 million compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increased production depletion and expenses on higher produced volumes as well as higher selling general and administrative expenses consistent with the growth of the business these increases were partially offset by the absence of expenses associated with big sandy and langley primarily operating and maintenance expenses and favorable adjustments for certain nonincome tax matters

consolidated operational data 

  

eqt production’s average wellhead sales price is calculated by allocating some of its revenues to eqt midstream for the gathering and transportation of produced gas the following operational information presents detailed gross liquid and natural gas operational information as well as midstream deductions to assist the understanding of the company’s consolidated operations 

  

  

   

a   the company’s annual volume weighted nymex price average nymex natural gas price mcf was 279 404 and 439 in the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

 due to the sale of unused capacity on the el paso 300 line that was not under longterm resale agreements at prices below the capacity charge thirdparty gathering and transmission rates increased by 004 per mcfe for the year ended 2012 in 2011 the unused capacity on the el paso 300 line not under longterm resale agreements was sold at prices above the capacity charge 

  

  

decreasing thirdparty gathering and transmission rates by 003 per mcfe for the year ended 2011 the el paso 300 line came online in 2011 and thus there was no unused capacity sold in the year ended 2010 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income other income interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses totaling 233 million 293 million and 151 million were not allocated to the operating segments for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively as part of the 2012 budgeting process the company allocated additional corporate overhead charges to the operating segments 

  

the company has reported the components of each segment’s operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived eqt’s management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition operations and trends of each of eqt’s business segments without being obscured by the financial condition operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest income taxes and other income in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes the company’s management reviews and reports the eqt production segment results for operating revenues and purchased gas costs with transportation costs reflected as a deduction from operating revenues as management believes this presentation provides a more useful view of net wellhead price and is consistent with industry practices thirdparty transportation costs are reported as a component of purchased gas costs in the consolidated results the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income to the company’s consolidated operating income and net income in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements

a   natural gas ngl and oil production represents the company’s interest in natural gas ngl and oil production measured at the wellhead it is equal to the sum of total sales volumes and company usage and line loss 

  

b production taxes include severance and productionrelated ad valorem and other property taxes in 2012 production taxes also include the pennsylvania impact fee of 153 million the production taxes unit rate for 2012 excludes the impact of 67 million paid upon enactment in that year for pre2012 marcellus wells 

  

c capital expenditures in the eqt production segment include 926 million of liabilities assumed in exchange for producing properties as part of the anpi transaction in 2011 and 2307 million of undeveloped property which was acquired with eqt common stock in 2010 

  

year ended december 31 2012 vs december 31 2011 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 1879 million for 2012 compared to 3871 million for 2011 the 1992 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a lower average wellhead sales price and an increase in operating expenses partially offset by increased sales of produced natural gas and ngls 

  

total operating revenues were 7938 million for 2012 compared to 7913 million for 2011 the 25 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a 33 increase in production sales volumes which offset a 25 decrease in the average wellhead sales price to eqt production the increase in production sales volumes was primarily the result of increased production from the 2011 and 2012 drilling programs in the marcellus play as well as the acquisition of producing properties associated with the anpi transaction in may 2011 which added 26 bcfe of sales volumes in 2012 this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the 099 per mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price to eqt production was primarily due to a 31 decrease in the average nymex gas price as well as lower basis and ngl prices partially offset by higher hedging gains and lower affiliated gathering rates compared to 2011 the average wellhead sales price was also impacted unfavorably in 2012 by 003 per mcfe as a result of an 82 million adjustment to recognize financial instrument put premiums which should have been recorded ratably over 2010 and 2011 and by 004 per mcfe for the cost of transmission capacity on the el paso 300 line including longterm resale agreements management evaluated the size and nature of the put premium adjustment and concluded that the adjustment was not material to the financial statements 

  

operating expenses totaled 6059 million for 2012 compared to 4042 million for 2011 the increase in operating expenses was the result of increases in dda sga production taxes loe and exploration expense 

  

  

depletion expense increased as a result of a higher overall depletion rate and higher produced volumes in 2012 the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to an increase in costs to complete wells higher capitalized overhead and interest costs and the removal of proved reserves due to lower natural gas prices and the suspension of drilling activity in the huron play the increase in sga was primarily a result of higher corporate overhead and commercial services allocations of 220 million increased labor and relocation expenses of 40 million associated with increased marcellus drilling and an increase in franchise taxes of 19 million 

  

in february 2012 the commonwealth of pennsylvania passed legislation imposing a natural gas impact fee the legislation which covers a significant portion of eqt’s marcellus shale acreage imposes an annual fee for a period of fifteen years on each well drilled in pennsylvania the impact fee adjusts annually based on three factors age of the well changes in the consumer price index and the average monthly nymex gas price production taxes increased primarily due to the pennsylvania impact fee in 2012 of 153 million of which 67 million represents the retroactive fee for pre2012 marcellus wells as well as an increase in property taxes partially offset by a decrease in severance taxes due to the decrease in average wellhead sales price in 2012 

  

the increase in loe was mainly a result of increased marcellus activity in 2012 primarily related to a 30 million increase in salt water disposal expenses and a 21 million increase in labor expenses as well as the elimination of 23 million of thirdparty operating expense reimbursements as part of the anpi transaction exploration expense increased in 2012 primarily due to increased impairments of unproved lease acreage of 30 million and also an increase in geophysical activity in 2012 related to the ohio utica formation 

  

year ended december 31 2011 vs december 31 2010 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 3871 million for 2011 compared to 2235 million for 2010 an increase of 1636 million between years primarily due to increased production sales volumes and higher wellhead sales prices to eqt production partially offset by an increase in dda and other operating costs resulting from higher volumes 

  

total net operating revenues were 7913 million for 2011 compared to 5377 million for 2010 the 2536 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a 44 increase in production sales volumes as well as a 3 increase in the average wellhead sales price to eqt production the increase in sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus play as well as the acquisition of producing properties associated with acquiring the class a interest in a trust thereby acquiring 100 of the net profits interest associated with the producing properties the anpi transaction as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in may 2011 which added 55 bcfe of sales volumes in 2011 this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells the 011 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price to eqt production was primarily due to lower gathering rates and higher sales prices for ngls and oil in 2011 partially offset by an 8 decrease in the average nymex price compared to 2010 the average wellhead sales price was also impacted favorably from selling excess transmission capacity on the tennessee gas pipeline 300line in the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

operating expenses totaled 4042 million for 2011 compared to 3142 million for 2010 the 29 increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased dda production taxes and loe the depletion expense increased as a result of higher volumes in 2011 partially offset by a slightly lower overall depletion rate production taxes increased due to higher revenues and increased assessments in certain jurisdictions that impose these taxes in the year of production the increase in loe was primarily the result of increased activity in 2011 as well as the elimination as part of the anpi transaction of certain operating expense reimbursement agreements lower costs for road and location maintenance due to less severe weather in 2011 partly offset these increases sga increased due to higher overhead and commercial services costs associated with the growth of the company and higher franchise tax expense these increases were partially mitigated by a charge in 2010 related to the buyout of excess contractual capacity for water treatment and lower professional services hiring and relocation costs in 2011

eqt midstream’s operating income totaled 2373 million for 2012 compared to 4166 million for 2011 the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of the 2029 million pretax gain on the sales of langley and big sandy in 2011 and increased operating expenses in 2012 partly offset by an increase in 2012 net operating revenues 

  

total net operating revenues were 4494 million for 2012 compared to 4046 million for 2011 the increase in total net operating revenues was due to a 526 million increase in gathering net operating revenues and a 141 million increase in transmission net operating revenues partly offset by a 219 million decrease in storage marketing and other net operating revenues 

  

gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 30 increase in gathered volumes partly offset by a 7 decrease in the average gathering fee the gathered volume increase was driven by higher volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play the average gathering fee decreased due to the mix of gathered volumes as marcellus volumes increased while huron and other volumes which have a higher gathering fee decreased 

  

transmission net operating revenues in 2012 increased from the prior year primarily as a result of 158 million of increased capacity reservation revenues resulting from the sunrise pipeline project and the equitrans 2010 marcellus expansion project and higher firm transportation activity from affiliated shippers due to increased marcellus volumes these revenues were negatively impacted year over year by the absence of 160 million of revenues recorded on big sandy in the first half of 2011 

  

storage marketing and other net operating revenues decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of unrealized losses on derivatives and inventory lower margins and activity due to lower price spreads and volatility and a 43 million decrease in net operating revenue from ngls marketed for nonaffiliated producers primarily as a result of lower liquids pricing 

  

total operating revenues decreased 198 million primarily as a result of lower sales prices on decreased commercial activity and a lower gathering rate partly offset by an increase in gathered volumes and increased transmission revenue total purchased gas costs decreased 647 million primarily as a result of lower commodity prices on decreased commercial activity 

  

operating expenses totaled 2121 million for 2012 compared to 1909 million for 2011 the increase in om was primarily the result of a 133 million decrease in nonincome taxes largely as a result of favorable property tax settlements recorded in 2011 combined with increases in 2012 in line with the growth of the business in addition personnel cost increases in 2012 were partly offset by the absence of 28 million in operating costs for langley and big sandy in 2011 sga was flat year over year as the eqt midstream segment recovered approximately 29 million from the lehman brothers bankruptcy reversed 25 million in reserves for the recovery of a longterm volumebased regulatory asset and allocated 52 million more in expenses to affiliates offsetting increases in personnel costs and 12 million of increased expenses related to the partnership’s ipo and subsequent operation as a public company dda increased as a result of higher assets placed in service 

  

year ended december 31 2011 vs december 31 2010 

  

eqt midstream’s operating income totaled 4166 million for 2011 including gains on the dispositions of langley and big sandy of 2029 million compared to 1789 million for 2010 in addition to the gains operating income increased as a result of increased gathering and transmission volumes combined with lower operating expenses these favorable variances were partially offset by decreased storage marketing and other net operating revenues and a lower average gathering fee 

  

total net operating revenues were 4046 million for 2011 compared to 3965 million for 2010 the increase in total net operating revenues was due to a 374 million increase in gathering net operating revenues and a 62 million increase in transmission net operating revenues partly offset by a 355 million decrease in storage marketing and other net operating revenues 

  

  

gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 32 increase in gathered volumes partially offset by a 13 decrease in the average gathering fee this increase in gathered volumes was driven primarily by higher produced natural gas volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play the decrease in the average gathering fee was a result of lower gathering rates charged to affiliates and other shippers in the marcellus play 

  

transmission net operating revenues increased in 2011 as a result of higher firm transportation activity from affiliated shippers due to the increased marcellus volumes and increased capacity from the equitrans 2010 marcellus expansion project partly offset by the absence of revenues from the sale of big sandy 

  

storage marketing and other net operating revenue decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in natural gas volumes marketed for third parties utilizing pipeline capacity lower net revenue from ngls marketed for nonaffiliated producers lower margins due to reduced commodity prices and lower price spreads and volatility higher ngl prices were more than offset by the loss of processing fees associated with the sale of langley 

  

total operating revenues decreased in 2011 by 554 million primarily as a result of lower sales prices on decreased commercial activity and a lower gathering rate partially offset by an increase in gathered volumes and increased transmission revenue total purchased gas costs decreased as a result of decreased commercial activity 

  

operating expenses totaled 1909 million for 2011 compared to 2176 million for 2010 the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases of 237 million in om and 47 million in dda the decrease in om was primarily due to the absence of operating expenses associated with langley and big sandy and reductions in certain nonincome property tax reserves partly offset by increased compensation costs the decrease in dda was primarily due to the sales of big sandy and langley partly offset by increased depreciation on increased investment in gathering and compression infrastructure

decreases in total operating revenues and purchased gas costs were primarily due to lower customer throughput as a result of warmer weather during 2012 a decrease in the commodity component of tariff rates and a decrease in asset optimization offsystem and energy services revenues 

  

operating expenses totaled 1014 million for 2012 compared to 1007 million for 2011 as a 26 million increase in sga expenses was partly offset by a decrease in dda and om expenses the increase in sga expenses was primarily due to a 30 million reduction of certain nonincome tax reserves in 2011 as a result of settlements with tax authorities partly offset by lower bad debt expense of 09 million which was primarily the result of a lower commodity component of residential tariff rates in 2012 and the company’s favorable collections experience the company will continue to closely monitor its collection rates and adjust its reserve for uncollectible accounts as necessary the decrease in dda was primarily due to a change in the assumptions used in valuing the segment’s asset retirement obligation

interest expense increased by 82 million from 2010 to 2011 as a result of the company’s increased debt to fund its continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during the year the increase in interest from the company’s november 2011 issuance of 750 million 4875 notes and the debt assumed in the may 2011 anpi transaction was partially offset by higher capitalized interest on increased marcellus well development the company also paid higher commitment fees under the terms of its 15 billion revolving credit facility entered into on december 8 2010 than under the previous facility 

  

weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s longterm debt were 64 68 and 68 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt were 18 and 07 for 2011 and 2010 respectively the company had no shortterm debt in 2012 

  

income taxes 

   

income tax expense decreased by 1741 million from 2011 to 2012 as a result of lower pretax income and a decrease in the company’s effective income tax rate from 368 to 349 the decrease in the rate from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to a reduction in pretax book income on state tax paying entities and the impact of the partnership’s ipo the effective tax rate is impacted by the recent ipo which modified the midstream ownership structure and now reflects partnership earnings for which the noncontrolling public limited partners are directly responsible for the related income taxes the company consolidates the pretax income related to the noncontrolling public limited partners’ share of partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision other rate reconciling items had a larger percentage impact on the effective tax rate in 2012 than 2011 due to significantly higher pretax income in 2011 

  

income tax expense increased by 1518 million from 2010 to 2011 as a result of higher pretax income and an increase in the company’s effective income tax rate from 359 to 368 the company’s regulated business accounts for tax deductible repair costs as a permanent difference as the related deferred taxes are recoverable in rates the increase in the effective tax rate in 2011 was primarily the result of the tax benefit for these repair costs being higher in 2010 than in 2011 state income taxes were also higher in 2011 due to a shift in the company’s nonregulated business to states with higher income tax rates other rate reconciling items had a larger percentage impact on the effective tax rate in 2010 than 2011 due to significantly higher pretax income in 2011 

  

  

the company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss nol position for 2012 2011 and 2010 for federal income tax purposes the company deducts approximately 83 of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idc in the year incurred the primary reasons for the company’s net operating loss positions are the idc deduction resulting from the company’s drilling program and the accelerated tax deprecation for expansion of gathering infrastructure which provide tax deductions in excess of book deductions idcs however are sometimes limited for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt and can result in the company paying amt even when generating a regular tax nol see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s income taxes 

  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

  

as a result of the partnership’s ipo in 2012 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 130 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

  

outlook 

  

the company is committed to profitably developing its marcellus reserves through environmentally responsible costeffective and technologically advanced horizontal drilling the market price for natural gas can be volatile as demonstrated by significant declines in late 2011 and early 2012 and these fluctuations can impact the company’s revenues earnings and liquidity the company is unable to predict future movements in the market price for natural gas and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations however the company monitors the market for natural gas and adjusts its strategy and operations appropriately 

  

capital spending for well development primarily drilling in 2013 is expected to be approximately 115 billion to support the drilling of approximately 172 gross wells including 153 marcellus wells 11 upper devonian wells and eight wells in the utica shale of ohio sales volumes are expected to be between 335 and 340 bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 31 in 2013 

  

in addition the company plans to spend 400 million on midstream infrastructure in 2013 to support its production growth and expects gathering and transmission volumes to increase as a result of this expansion eqt midstream expects to add approximately 400 mmcf per day of incremental gathering capacity and approximately 450 mmcf per day of transmission capacity in 2013 the 2013 capital spending plan is expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow generated from operations and proceeds from expected midstream asset sales dropdowns to the partnership 

  

on december 19 2012 the company and its direct whollyowned subsidiary holdco executed the master purchase agreement with png companies pursuant to which eqt and holdco will transfer 100 of their ownership interests of equitable gas and homeworks to png companies in exchange for cash and select midstream assets of and new commercial arrangements with png companies and its affiliates homeworks and equitable gas are direct whollyowned subsidiaries of holdco peoples is a portfolio company of steelriver infrastructure partners the transaction or portions thereof requires the approval of the pa puc the wv psc the ky psc and the ferc in addition the transaction is subject to review under the hartscottrodino act the agreements provide that such approvals and review must be complete by december 19 2013 subject to certain extension rights these approvals and review may not be received or completed within the time allowed 

  

we continue to focus on achieving our objective of maximizing shareholder value via an overarching strategy of economically accelerating the monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with solid cash flow while the tactics continue to evolve based on market conditions the company is considering arrangements including asset sales to the partnership or others and joint ventures to monetize the value of mature assets for the redeployment into highergrowth marcellus shale development 

  

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

the company’s primary sources of cash for 2012 were cash flows from operating activities and a cash distribution from the partnership in connection with the partnership’s issuance of common units in the ipo the company’s primary use of cash in 2012 was for capital expenditures and repayments of longterm debt 

  

operating activities 

  

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities decreased 944 million from 9153 million in 2011 to 8209 million in 2012 the decline in operating receipts was a result of several factors including a 25 decline in average wellhead sales prices of natural gas higher cash payments for interest of 584 million a decrease in dividends received from nora gathering llc of 108 million record warm weather and higher operating expenses this decrease was partially offset by a 33 increase in the production of natural gas a 30 increase in gathered volumes and a 196 million decrease in cash payments for income taxes 

  

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was 9153 million compared to 7897 million for the same period of 2010 the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher operating receipts as a result of increased production in 2011 which more than offset the negative cash flow impact of paying 472 million in taxes in 2011 compared to receiving tax refunds of 1295 million in 2010 

  

investing activities 

  

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 13945 million for 2012 as compared to 6243 million for 2011 the 7702 million increase in cash flows used was attributable to reduced proceeds received from the sale of assets in 2012 compared to the 620 million proceeds received for the sales of langley and big sandy and 299 million received for the sales of availableforsale securities all in 2011 additionally as described below the company increased capital expenditures by 1251 million from 2011 to 2012 

  

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 6243 million for 2011 as compared to 12394 million for 2010 the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to 2011 proceeds from the sales of big sandy langley and availableforsale securities capital expenditures increased 273 million to 12743 million in 2011 see the discussion of capital expenditures below 

  

capital expenditures 

  

   

 the company does not forecast property acquisitions within its capital spending plan 

  

  

capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled 857 million and 938 million during 2012 and 2011 respectively the company drilled 135 gross wells 129 net wells in 2012 including 127 horizontal marcellus wells with approximately 700000 feet of pay 7 horizontal huron wells with approximately 37000 feet of pay and 1 horizontal utica well with approximately 5000 feet of pay compared to 222 gross wells 213 net wells in 2011 including 105 horizontal marcellus wells with approximately 500000 feet of pay and 115 horizontal huron wells with approximately 550000 feet of pay the 81 million decrease in capital expenditures for well development was primarily due to the suspension of drilling wells in the huron play in 2012 this was partially offset by additional development of the marcellus play at a lower average cost per well in 2012 when compared to 2011 as a result of drilling efficiencies and lower service company costs capital expenditures for 2012 also included approximately 135 million for undeveloped property acquisitions including 78 million within the utica play and 57 million within the marcellus play 

  

capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled 376 million for 2012 during the year eqt midstream turned inline approximately 89 miles of pipeline and 36000 horse power of compression primarily in the marcellus play eqt midstream also added 455 mmcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity and 700 mmcfe per day of transmission capacity in 2012 during 2011 midstream capital expenditures were 243 million eqt midstream turned inline 46 miles of pipeline and 20000 horse power of compression primarily within the marcellus play in 2011 

  

capital expenditures at distribution totaled 29 million and 31 million during 2012 and 2011 respectively principally for pipeline replacement

capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled 243 million for 2011 during the year eqt midstream turned inline 46 miles of pipeline and 20000 horse power of compression primarily in the marcellus play during 2010 midstream capital expenditures were 193 million eqt midstream turned inline 132 miles of pipeline and 21000 horse power of compression primarily within the huron play in 2010 

  

capital expenditures at distribution totaled 31 million and 37 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively principally for pipeline replacement 

  

financing activities 

  

cash flows used in financing activities totaled 755 million for 2012 as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of 5403 million in 2011 in 2012 the company received 2768 million in connection with the partnership’s issuance of common units repaid maturing longterm debt of 2193 million and paid the initial distribution to the partnership’s noncontrolling interests of 50 million in 2011 the company issued 750 million of 4875 senior notes due november 15 2021 and repaid shortterm loans of 537 million

in december 2012 in connection with its announcement of its definitive agreement to transfer equitable gas to png companies the company announced its intent to reduce its annual dividend rate effective january 2013 to 012 per share which the company believes better reflects the blend of the company’s core businesses remaining 

  

  

after giving effect to the pending transaction – a dividend supporting midstream business and a capitalintensive rapidly growing production business the company expects the favorable impact on cash provided by financing activities of the decline in the dividend rate to be partly offset by distributions to noncontrolling interests of the partnership 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

eqt primarily utilizes shortterm borrowings to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until they can be permanently financed to ensure sufficient levels of inventory and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments the amount of shortterm borrowings used for inventory transactions is driven by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution and marketing operations margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices our credit ratings and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that expires on december 8 2016 the company may request two oneyear extensions of the expiration date subject to satisfaction of certain conditions 

  

the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and any other lawful corporate purposes the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 16 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company 

  

under the terms of the revolving credit facility the company may obtain base rate loans or fixed period eurodollar rate loans base rate loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the company’s then current credit rating fixed period eurodollar rate loans bear interest at a eurodollar rate plus a margin based on the company’s then current credit rating 

  

the company had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2012 and 2011 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 the company incurred commitment fees averaging approximately 25 basis points and 30 basis points respectively to maintain credit availability under the revolving credit facility 

  

there were no shortterm loans outstanding at any time during 2012 the maximum amount of outstanding shortterm loans at any time during the year ended december 31 2011 was 1040 million the average daily balance of shortterm loans outstanding during the year ended december 31 2011 was approximately 55 million at a weighted average annual interest rate of 181 

  

the company’s shortterm borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less 

  

in connection with the ipo the partnership entered into a 350 million revolving credit facility that expires on july 2 2017 the credit facility is available to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures to purchase assets to pay distributions and repurchase units and for general partnership purposes the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 13 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the partnership the company is not a guarantor of the partnership’s obligations under the credit facility the partnership’s obligations under the revolving portion of the credit facility are unsecured 

  

the partnership which was formed in 2012 had no letters of credit and no loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility at any time during the year ended december 31 2012 for the year ended december 31 2012 the partnership incurred commitment fees averaging approximately 25 basis points to maintain credit availability under the revolving credit facility 

  

  

security ratings and financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the company at december 31 2012 changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm and longterm debt including interest rates and fees under its lines of credit collateral requirements under derivative instruments and its access to the credit markets 

  

   

in response to the company’s announcement of the master purchase agreement with png companies on december 20 2012 the ratings agencies took the following actions 

  

·   moody’s placed eqt’s ratings of baa2 and p2 under review for downgrade 

·   sp confirmed eqt’s ratings of bbb a2 with a stable outlook and 

·   fitch downgraded eqt’s ratings to bbbf3 from bbbf2 

  

the company’s credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company’s ratings particularly below investment grade the company’s access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits on derivative contracts would increase counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease the required margin on derivative instruments is also subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the company 

  

the company’s debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that if not complied with could require early payment additional collateral support or similar actions the most significant default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum debttototal capitalization ratio insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s current credit facility contains financial covenants that require a total debttototal capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2012 the company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants 

  

the partnership’s credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that if not complied with could require early payment or similar action including a requirement to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 500 to 100 or after the partnership obtains an investment grade rating not more than 550 to 100 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions and until the partnership obtains an investment grade rating a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 300 to 100 as of december 31 2012 the partnership was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants 

  

commodity risk management 

  

the substantial majority of the company’s commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the company’s produced natural gas the company’s overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company’s risk management program may include the use of exchangetraded natural gas futures contracts and options and otc natural gas swap agreements and options collectively derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price swaps collars and futures 

  

  

as of january 24 2013 the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s hedge position for 2013 through 2015 production were 

  

   

   

 the average price is based on a conversion rate of 105 mmbtumcf 

  

see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 4 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s hedging program 

  

other items 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005 the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco the savings guarantees provided that once the energyefficiency construction was completed by noresco the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees were approximately 192 million as of december 31 2012 extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 15 years 

  

in exchange for the company’s agreement to maintain these guarantee obligations the purchaser of the noresco business and noresco agreed among other things that noresco would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and agreed to reimburse the company for any loss under the guarantee obligations provided that the purchaser’s reimbursement obligation will not exceed 6 million in the aggregate and will expire on november 18 2014 in 2008 the original purchaser of noresco sold its interest in noresco and transferred its obligations to a third party in connection with that event the new owner delivered to the company a 1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations 

  

the noresco guarantees are exempt from fasb asc topic 460 guarantees the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

  

rate regulation 

  

as described under “regulation” in item 1 “business” the company’s distribution operations transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as described in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

 

  

purchase obligations are commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines some of which extend up to approximately 15 years the company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties amounts included in the above table for capacity released under longterm agreements approximate 750 million and 274 million in 2013 and 2014 respectively 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program the obligations for the company’s various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately 999 million as of december 31 2012 the company has subleased some of these facilities sublease payments to the company total 281 million and are not netted from the amounts presented in the above table the company has agreements with savanna drilling llc pioneer drilling company and patterson drilling company to provide drilling equipment and services to the company over the next four years these obligations totaled approximately 654 million as of december 31 2012 

  

as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 of 184 million of which 146 million would primarily reduce the net operating loss carryover and thus is offset against deferred tax assets the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal or other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company 

  

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s commitments and contingencies 

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon eqt’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities under this method all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves   if an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit the depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred the company estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties the estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable those properties would be written down to fair value which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

  

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made unproved properties had a net book value of 3856 million 3588 million and 4459 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which can be significantly impacted by management’s expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans should the company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the 12month period operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans and pension and other postretirement benefits recorded in other comprehensive income the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if this step is satisfied then the company must measure the tax position the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement see note 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed including carrybacks tax planning strategies reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

derivative instruments  the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge natural gas inventory and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates energy trading contracts are also utilized to leverage assets and limit exposure to shifts in market prices derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value if the derivative qualifies and is designated for cash flow hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings for fair value hedges the company also records the change in the fair value of the hedged item inventory in the statements of consolidated income see “commodity risk management” above item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about 

  

  

market risk” and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding hedging activities 

  

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use as inputs marketbased parameters including but not limited to forward curves discount rates broker quotes volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a riskfree instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

a substantial majority of the company’s derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be dedesignated the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings which could materially impact the results of operations one of the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged effectiveness may be impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective the company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit fundamentals credit ratings credit default swap rates and market activity 

  

in addition the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements given the company’s price risk management position and price volatility the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices by changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of nonperformance risk and by changes in margin requirements future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company increases the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

sharebased compensation the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 longterm incentive plans awards to employees are typically made in the form of performancebased awards timebased restricted stock and stock options awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units 

  

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards awards under the 2011 value driver award program 2011 vda which were paid out in cash on december 31 2012 were treated as liability awards phantom units which vest upon grant expected to be satisfied in cash are also treated as liability awards for liability awards the company is required to estimate on grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment the fair value of the ultimate payout based upon the expected performance through and value of the company’s common stock on the vesting date the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award in the case of a performancebased award and until payment in the case of phantom units the company reviews its assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

  

performancebased awards expected to be satisfied in company common stock or partnership units are treated as equity awards awards under the 2010 executive performance incentive program 2010 epip the july 2010 executive performance incentive program july 2010 epip and the 2010 stock incentive award program 2010 sia which were paid out in company common stock on december 31 2012 were treated as equity awards awards under the 2011 volume and efficiency program 2011 vep the 2012 executive performance incentive program 2012 epip the 2012 value driver award program 2012 vda and the eqm tr program which remain outstanding at december 31 2012 are treated as equity awards for equity awards the company is required to determine the grant date fair value of the awards which is then recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period of the award determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding among other things the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies most often the company is required to obtain a valuation based upon assumptions regarding riskfree rates of return dividend yields expected volatilities and the expected term of the award the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s common stock and any changes expected thereto and where applicable of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s common stock and where applicable the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period 

  

for timebased restricted stock awards the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically three years for phantom units which vest on date of grant expected to be satisfied in equity the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company’s financial statements in the year of grant the grant date fair value in both cases is determined based upon the closing price of the company’s common stock on the date of the grant 

  

for nonqualified stock options the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period typically two years the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s stock at the time of grant the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock at the time of grant the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant 

  

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s shares future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company’s sharebased compensation 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through eqt production and the storage marketing and other activities at eqt midstream the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is regularly monitored the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge natural gas inventory and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

commodity price risk 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk and to hedge natural gas inventory which is exposed to changes in fair value the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels 

  

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity the company also considers other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the company hedged portions of expected equity production portions of forecasted purchases and sales and portions of natural gas inventory by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 356 bcf and 347 bcf of natural gas respectively see the “commodity risk management” section in the “capital resources and liquidity” section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2012 and 2011 levels would increase the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1310 million and 1291 million respectively a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2012 and 2011 levels would decrease the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1302 million and 1281 million respectively 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2012 

  

  

the price change was then applied to the nontrading natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company and the partnership earn on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rates the company and the partnership pay on borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities all of the company’s longterm borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s borrowings and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have limited credit risk because the cftc regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from potential financial instability of the exchange members the company’s otc swap collar and option derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole 

  

the company utilizes various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures this includes monitoring market conditions counterparty credit fundamentals and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 80 or 3030 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2012 had a positive fair value approximately 81 or 5085 million of the company’s otc derivative contracts at december 31 2011 had a positive fair value 

  

as of december 31 2012 the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and has no knowledge of default by any counterparty to derivative contracts during 2012 the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas ngls and crude oil to certain marketers utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area and a gas processor in kentucky additionally a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt midstream are generated from the gathering of natural gas in kentucky virginia pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that expires on december 8 2016 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company as of december 31 2012 the company had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry 

  

the partnership has a 350 million revolving credit facility that expires on july 2 2017 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowing by the partnership as of december 31 2012 the partnership had no letters of credit and no loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the partnership’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the partnership’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

eqt corporation eqt or the company conducts its business through three business segments eqt production eqt midstream and distribution eqt production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the appalachian basin with 54 tcfe of proved reserves across 35 million acres including approximately 530000 acres in the marcellus play as of december 31 2011 eqt midstream provides gathering transmission and storage services for the company’s produced gas and to independent third parties in the appalachian basin until february 1 2011 when the company sold the kentucky hydrocarbon gas processing facility in langley kentucky langley eqt midstream also provided processing services distribution through its regulated natural gas distribution subsidiary equitable gas company llc equitable gas distributes and sells natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania west virginia and eastern kentucky operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania and provides offsystem sales activities which include the purchase and delivery of gas to customers 

  

eqt has 54 tcfe of proved reserves across three major plays marcellus huron and cbm all in the appalachian basin including 34 tcfe in the marcellus the company’s strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing its undeveloped marcellus reserves eqt believes that it is a technological leader in drilling shale in the appalachian basin 

  

eqt’s proved marcellus reserves increased by 19 in 2011 while the company’s cost structure remained at an industry leading level as of december 31 2011 the company’s proved reserves including proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the resource plays to which the reserves relate are as follows 

  

   

 the company includes the lower huron cleveland berea sandstone and other devonian shales except the marcellus in its huron play also included in the huron play is 713 bcfe of reserves from nonshale formations accessed through vertical wells 

  

assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2011 the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by current year produced volumes is 27 years 

  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk with long lives and low development and production costs the gas produced from many of these wells has a high energy content and is within close proximity to natural gas markets most of the company’s huron well production and some of its marcellus well production is liquidsrich 

  

in the marcellus eqt applies extended lateral horizontal drilling technology to its approximate 530000 acres and 34 tcfe of proved reserves eqt continues to be a leader in the use of new drilling and completion technology which increases lateral length drilled and reserves per foot of pay marcellus wells have target depths ranging from 7000 to 8000 feet with an average lateral spacing of 1000 feet 

  

in light of lower natural gas prices and the resultant reduction in projected cash flow the company decided in january 2012 to suspend development in the huron indefinitely in favor of investing in its higher return marcellus play a similar decision was made in december 2010 when the company suspended the development of its cbm play in virginia proved reserves from these two plays were 33 and 3 respectively of total proved reserves at 

  

  

december 31 2011 the company expects to continue to produce from existing wells in the huron and cbm plays but their contribution to the company’s total production sales volumes will gradually decline as the company focuses all new drilling in the marcellus the huron and cbm plays accounted for approximately 58 of production sales volumes in 2011 and are expected to account for approximately 40 of production sales volumes in 2012 

  

the company invested approximately 938 million on well development primarily drilling in 2011 production sales volumes increased 44 in 2011 over 2010 over the past three years the company’s wells drilled and related capital expenditures for well development were 

  

   

in may 2011 the company purchased all of the outstanding net profits interest npi from the other investor anpi in a trust in which eqt owned an existing interest the anpi transaction this transaction resulted in an increase in oil and gas properties of 1406 million assumed debt and other liabilities of 926 million and a pretax gain of 101 million recorded in other income on the revaluation of the previously existing equity investment in the trust to fair value 

  

to support the growth of the marcellus play the company is increasing its available gathering and transmission system capacity in the region during 2011 the company completed construction of the callisto compressor station which added 14205 horsepower of compression and 150 mmcfe per day of delivery capacity to the equitrans lp equitrans eqt’s fercregulated transmission storage and gathering system gathering system for eqt production in greene county pennsylvania the company has marcellus gathering capacity of 440 mmcfe per day in pennsylvania and 85 mmcfe per day in west virginia the company has approximately 10450 miles of gathering lines 

  

  

the company’s transmission and storage system includes a fercregulated interstate pipeline system of approximately 700 miles that connects to five interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies and is supported by 14 associated natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 400 mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 32 bcf of working gas capacity eqt’s storage reservoirs are clustered in two geographic areas connected to its equitrans pipeline with eight in northern west virginia and six in southwestern pennsylvania 

  

through eqt’s gas marketing subsidiary eqt energy llc eqt energy the company provides optimization of capacity and storage assets ngl sales and gas sales to commercial and industrial customers within its operational footprint through 65 bcf of leased storagerelated assets and approximately 880000 dth per day of third party contractual pipeline capacity 

  

on february 1 2011 eqt midstream sold langley and the associated ngl pipeline to markwest energy partners lp markwest for 230 million subject to customary purchase price adjustments the company realized a pretax gain of 228 million on this sale in conjunction with the closing of the sale of the langley plant eqt executed a longterm agreement with markwest to obtain processing services for its kentucky huron gas and extended its existing agreement with markwest for ngl transportation fractionation and marketing services until 2022 markwest has commenced construction of a new cryogenic processing plant to expand the langley cryogenic processing capacity which is expected to be online in 2012 in addition markwest has agreed to construct a natural gas processing facility in logansport wv the logansport facility is expected to be online in 2012 markwest will then provide natural gas processing services for eqt’s marcellus production in north central west virginia as well as ngl transportation fractionation and marketing services the sunrise pipeline project described below will connect this facility to equitrans and its interconnects with five major interstate pipelines 

  

on july 1 2011 the company sold the big sandy pipeline big sandy to spectra energy partners lp for 390 million big sandy is a natural gas pipeline regulated by the ferc which transports natural gas from the langley natural gas processing complex to interconnects with unaffiliated pipelines leading to the midatlantic and northeast markets in conjunction with this transaction the company realized a pretax gain of 1801 million 

  

capital expenditures for well development primarily drilling in 2012 are expected to be approximately 1055 million to support the drilling of approximately 158 gross wells including 146 gross marcellus wells and 12 huron wells which were either spud in january 2012 or are required to maintain lease rights in addition the company plans to spend 365 million for midstream infrastructure in 2012 sales volumes are expected to be between 250 and 255 bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 30 in 2012 the company currently believes that the 2012 capital expenditure plan will be funded by cash flow generated from operations and cash on hand 

  

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by profitably developing the company’s undeveloped marcellus reserves by utilizing the company’s extensive gathering and transmission assets low cost structure close proximity to the northeastern united states markets and the high energy content of much of its produced natural gas 

  

the company has used technology to increase lateral length and develop multiwell pads recoveries from extended laterals have been proportional to the length increase the company expects to continue increasing the average lateral lengths over time however lateral lengths will be limited by lease boundaries in the marcellus unless the company is able to pool acreage with neighboring leaseholders because substantially all of the company’s acreage is held by production or in fee eqt production is able to develop its acreage in the most economic manner by using longer laterals and multi pad drilling rather than focusing on drilling less economic wells in order to retain acreage the company has produced industry leading results in its core development area in greene county pennsylvania 

  

the company believes the location of its midstream assets across a wide area of the marcellus in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia uniquely positions it for growth in light of the growth of eqt production and other producers in the marcellus eqt midstream intends to capitalize on the growing need for 

  

  

gathering and transmission infrastructure in the region especially the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

eqt plans to continue its investment in gathering and transmission capacity in the marcellus in 2012 the company intends to add 445 mmcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity 285 mmcfe per day in pennsylvania and 160 mmcfe per day in west virginia equitrans recently received approval from the ferc to proceed with construction of the sunrise pipeline project the sunrise pipeline will provide access to liquidsrich marcellus acreage and will consist of 415 miles of 24inch diameter pipeline that parallels and interconnects with an existing segment of our transmission and storage system from wetzel county west virginia to greene county pennsylvania in addition the sunrise pipeline project will include connecting to a new delivery point with texas eastern transmission in green county and constructing the jefferson compressor station which will provide 314 bbtu or approximately 300 mmcfe per day of additional firm capacity to the system the company also intends to add another 400 mmcfe per day of additional transmission capacity in 2012 the combination of these gathering and transmission investments with existing assets will provide a platform for growth mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the company’s gathering and transmission systems 

  

  the company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas with the assistance of a 700000 grant received from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the company opened a publicaccess natural gas fueling station in pittsburgh pa during 2011 in conjunction with this project the company is promoting the use of ngv fleet vehicles including its own eqt plans to operate 23 of its vehicle fleet more than 330 vehicles on natural gas by the end of 2013 the company also plans to convert two drilling rigs to utilize natural gas in 2012

markets and customers 

  

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of revenues in 2011 2010 or 2009 

  

natural gas sales   eqt’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas can be volatile as demonstrated by significant declines in late 2011 and early 2012 changes in the market price for natural gas impact the company’s revenues earnings and liquidity the company is unable to predict potential future movements in the market price for natural gas and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations however the company monitors the market for natural gas and adjusts strategy and operations as deemed appropriate in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

ngl sales   the company sells ngls from its own production through the eqt production segment and from gas marketed for third parties by eqt midstream until february 2011 the company processed natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas ngls were recovered at eqt’s langley facility and transported to a fractionation plant owned by a thirdparty for separation into commercial components the thirdparty marketed these components for a fee the company also had contractual processing arrangements whereby the company sold gas to a thirdparty processor at a weighted average liquids component price subsequent to the closing of the sale of the langley facility to markwest the processing of the company’s produced natural gas has been performed by a thirdparty vendor 

  

  

  

the following table presents the wellhead sales price on an average mcfe basis to eqt corporation for sales of produced natural gas ngls and oil with and without hedges for the years ended december 31 

  

   

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to geographically diverse markets 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2011 totaled 2582 bbtu of which approximately 75 related to gathering for eqt production 16 related to thirdparty volumes and 9 related to volumes for other affiliates of the company revenues from eqt production and other affiliates accounted for approximately 87 of 2011 gathering revenues 

  

natural gas transmission storage and marketing services offered by eqt include commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services these operations are executed using company owned and operated transmission and underground storage facilities as well as other contractual capacity arrangements with major pipeline and storage service providers in the eastern united states eqt energy uses leased storage capacity and firm transportation capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities when available eqt energy also engages in risk management and energy trading activities the objective of which is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets 

  

customers of eqt midstream’s gas transportation storage risk management and related services are affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and ugi energy services inc eqt energy’s commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services are offered to natural gas producers and energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers 

  

equitrans’ firm transportation contracts expire between 2012 and 2023 the company anticipates that the capacity associated with these expiring contracts will be remarketed or used by affiliates such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed in 2011 approximately 84 of transportation volumes and revenues were from affiliates 

  

natural gas distribution the company’s distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 276500 customers consisting of 257700 residential customers and 18800 commercial and industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia distribution’s service areas have a rather static population and economy 

  

equitable gas purchases gas through contracts with various sources including major and independent producers in the gulf coast local producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate the gas purchase contracts contain various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices the cost of purchased gas is equitable gas’ largest operating expense and is passed through to customers utilizing mechanisms approved by the pa puc and wv psc equitable gas is not permitted to profit from fluctuations in gas costs and does not purchase gas produced by eqt production 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 66 of calendar year 2011 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during the offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

  

  

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators key competitors for new gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies natural gas marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers as a regulated utility the company’s distribution operation experiences only limited competition with other local distribution companies in its operating area but experiences usage pressures as a result of alternative fuels and conservation 

  

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances such as safety regulations these regulations may impact the costs of developing the company’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties both kentucky and virginia allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration while in west virginia and pennsylvania it is necessary to rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas 

  

eqt midstream’s transmission and gathering operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices compliance with safety regulations and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations these regulations may impact the costs of or increase the time of developing new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations 

  

eqt midstream has both nonregulated and regulated rate operations the interstate natural gas transmission systems and storage operations are regulated by the ferc for instance the ferc approves tariffs that establish equitrans’ rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service to equitrans’ customers the fees or rates established under equitrans’ tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new facilities extension or abandonment of services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

  

eqt production and eqt midstream each engage in natural gas trading activities which are regulated by among others the cftc in july 2010 federal legislation was enacted that among other things established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities that participate in that market the legislation requires the sec and cftc to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation and as of the date of 

  

  

this report most of the key implementing regulations have not been adopted accordingly it is not possible at this time to predict the impact of the legislation on our hedging program 

  

equitable gas’ distribution rates terms of service and certain contracts with affiliates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the wv psc the field line sales rates in kentucky are subject to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission 

  

equitable gas must usually seek the approval of one or more of its regulators prior to changing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and transportation activities equitable gas is allowed to recover a return in addition to the costs of its distribution and gathering delivery activities however equitable gas’ regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term 

  

as required by pennsylvania law equitable gas has a customer assistance program that assists lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the cost of this program is recovered through rates charged to other residential customers 

  

regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 

  

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public and the pollution preservation remediation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife or the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing drilling operating and abandoning wells and related surface facilities in most instances the regulatory frameworks relate to the handling of drilling and production materials the disposal of drilling and production wastes the protection of water and air and the protection of people 

  

the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by protective rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells 

  

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation effective january 1 2011 the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emissions by subjecting new facilities and major modifications to existing facilities that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to the permitting requirements of the federal clean air act in addition the us congress has been considering bills that would establish a capandtrade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 

  

employees 

  

the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1835 employees at the end of 2011 as of december 31 2011 approximately 11 of the company’s workforce was subject to collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreement which covers approximately 9 of the company’s workforce expired on september 25 2011 the union agreed to continue working under the terms and conditions of the expired labor agreement while the parties continue negotiations for a new agreement the collective bargaining agreement which covers approximately 1 of the company’s workforce will expire on may 21 2012

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

  

lower natural gas prices may result in decreases in the revenue margin and cash flow for each of our businesses a reduction in drilling activity and the construction of new transportation capacity and downward adjustments to the value of oil and gas properties which may cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings moreover if we fail to control our operating costs during periods of lower natural gas prices we could further reduce our margin a reduction in margin or cash flow will reduce our funds available for capital expenditures and correspondingly our opportunities for growth we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value 

  

increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts in an asset position hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap collar and option agreements and exchange traded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

  

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation storage and distribution of natural gas and natural gas liquids such as well site blowouts cratering and explosions pipe and other equipment and system failures uncontrolled flows of natural gas or well fluids fires formations with abnormal pressures pollution and environmental risks and natural disasters these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage moreover in the event that one or more of these hazards occur there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage as a result of these risks we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury 

  

  

and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

  

our failure to develop obtain or maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of gas depends upon the availability proximity and capacity of pipelines other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities in the marcellus the capacity of transportation gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells competition for pipeline infrastructure within the region is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do which could affect our competitive position the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as processing adjacent to and curtailments on such pipelines our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty gas transportation gathering processing and storage facilities which are limited in number geographically concentrated and subject to the same risks identified above with respect to our infrastructure development and maintenance programs an extended interruption of access to or service from our or thirdparty facilities could result in adverse consequences to us such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas in such event we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project in addition some of our thirdparty contracts may involve significant longterm financial commitments on our part moreover our usage of third parties for transportation gathering and processing services subjects us to the credit and performance risk of such third parties and may make us dependent upon those third parties to get our produced natural gas to market 

  

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

  

we rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings 

  

any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity we cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish financial results 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2012 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity midstream 

  

  

infrastructure distribution infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2012 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2012 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering systems pipelines and distribution systems environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection locations available for drilling and pipeline construction environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety including replacement requirements and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business or result in delays due to the need to obtain additional or more detailed governmental approvals and permits these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

  

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are in many cases subject to state or federal regulation the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming for instance effective january 1 2011 the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emission by subjecting new facilities and major modifications to existing facilities that emit large emissions of greenhouse gas emissions to the permitting requirements of the federal clean air act 

  

in addition the us congress and various states have been evaluating climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

in july 2011 the epa issued proposed rules that would subject all oil and gas operations production processing transmission storage and distribution to regulation under the new source performance standards “nsps” and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants “neshap” programs the epa’s proposed rules also include nsps standards for the completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured the proposed regulations under neshap include maximum achievable control technology standards for certain equipment not currently subject to such standards the final regulations could result in an increase to our costs or require changes that reduce our production 

  

  

in addition hydraulic fracturing is utilized to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed or is under discussion at the federal and state levels we cannot predict whether any such federal or state legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how they may impact our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs 

  

recent federal budget proposals have included provisions which could potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal income taxes of independent producers of natural gas and oil proposals that would significantly affect us would repeal the expensing of intangible drilling costs repeal the percentage depletion allowance and increase the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses these changes if enacted will make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our natural gas resources 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability 

  

in july 2010 federal legislation was enacted that among other things establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter otc derivatives market and entities that participate in that market the new legislation requires the sec and the cftc to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation and as of the date of this report most of the key implementing regulations have not been adopted accordingly it is not possible at this time to predict the impact of the new legislation on our hedging program it is possible however that the legislation will make hedging more expensive uneconomic or unavailable which could lead to increased costs or commodity price volatility or a combination of both 

  

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the gas to market successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect in addition any exploration projects increase the risks inherent in our natural gas activities specifically seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our operations because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs equipment and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology equipment failure or accidents and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of 

  

  

existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

we also rely on third parties for certain construction drilling and completion services materials and supplies delays or failures to perform by such third parties could adversely impact our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things the oil spill in the gulf of mexico the explosion of natural gas transmission lines in california and elsewhere and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these action may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals which could increase the costs associated with attracting and retaining such personnel if we cannot attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

  

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 

  

you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas ngls and oil and the amount timing and cost of actual production in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas ngl and oil industry in general 

  

our proved reserves are estimates that are based upon many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 

  

reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices production levels and operating and development costs these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise as a result estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas ngls and oil the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve 

  

  

  

estimates are based as described above often result in the actual quantities of natural gas ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates

principal facilities are owned or in the case of certain office locations warehouse buildings and equipment leased by the company’s business segments the majority of the company’s properties are located on or under 1 private properties owned in fee held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles or 2 public highways under franchises or permits from various governmental authorities the company’s facilities are generally well maintained and where appropriate are replaced or expanded to meet operating requirements 

  

eqt production   eqt production’s properties are located primarily in pennsylvania west virginia kentucky and virginia this segment has approximately 35 million gross acres approximately 63 of which are considered undeveloped which encompasses substantially all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil production properties approximately 530000 of these acres are located in the marcellus although most of its wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths 2000 to 8000 feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2011 the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 5365 bcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 2502 bcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 464 bcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 2399 bcfe substantially all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves are prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for preparing the reserve report and the technical aspects of the reserves audit received a bachelor’s degree in petroleum and natural gas engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has twentythree years of experience in the oil and gas industry to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve roll forward between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves is audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp ryder scott which is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally ryder scott reviewed 100 of the total net gas and liquid hydrocarbon proved reserves attributable to the company’s interests as of december 31 2011 ryder scott conducted a detailed well by well audit of the company’s largest properties this audit covered 80 of the company’s proved reserves ryder scott’s audit of the remaining 20 of the company’s properties consisted of an audit of aggregated groups not exceeding 200 wells per group ryder scott’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 9901 

  

no report has been filed with any federal authority or agency reflecting a 5 or more difference from the company’s estimated total reserves additional information relating to the company’s estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows is provided in note 22 unaudited to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

in 2011 the company commenced drilling operations “spud” or “drilled” on 105 gross horizontal wells with an aggregate of approximately 500000 feet of pay in the marcellus play total proved reserves in the marcellus play increased 19 to 34 tcfe in 2011 as a result of the company’s 2011 drilling program in the huron play the company drilled 115 gross horizontal wells with an aggregate of approximately 550000 feet of pay during 2011 total proved reserves in the huron play including vertical nonshale formations decreased 19 to 18 tcfe as the company plans to focus its capital expenditures during the next five years on developing the marcellus play the company did not drill any gross cbm wells in 2011 the cbm play had total proved reserves of 02 tcfe at december 31 2011 slightly up from 2010 natural gas production sales volumes in 2011 from the marcellus huron and cbm plays were 816 bcfe 991 bcfe and 137 bcfe respectively over the past three years the company has experienced a 99 developmental drilling success rate 

  

natural gas ngl and crude oil production and pricing 

  

   

the company’s average per unit production cost excluding production taxes of natural gas and crude oil during 2011 2010 and 2009 was 020 024 and 030 per mcfe respectively at december 31 2011 the company had approximately 57 multiple completion wells 

  

  

   

  

   

as of december 31 2011 the company did not have any reserves that have been classified as proved undeveloped reserves for more than five years 

  

  

certain lease and acquisition agreements require the company to drill 6 wells in the marcellus formation in 2012 within specified acreage the company intends to satisfy such requirements to the extent that they fit into its 2012 marcellus development program however approximately 200 acres could expire in so much as they currently fall outside of its priority development areas as of december 31 2011 and not including the above leases associated with 8988 gross undeveloped acres expire in 2012 if they are not renewed however the company has an active lease renewal program in areas targeted for development

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

in 2011 eqt achieved record results highlights for 2011 include 

  

·   record annual production sales volumes of 1944 bcfe 44 higher than in 2010 

  

·   marcellus proved reserves increased by 19 

  

·   unit lease operating expense excluding production taxes loe decreased 17 in 2011 to 020 per mcfe including production taxes loe was 040 per mcfe and 

  

·   record eqt midstream throughput and operating income 

  

eqt’s consolidated net income for 2011 was 4798 million 319 per diluted share compared with 2277 million 157 per diluted share for 2010 and 1569 million 119 per diluted share for 2009 in 2011 the company recorded 1283 million of aftertax gains on dispositions related to the sales of langley and big sandy as described in item i “business” 

  

operating income increased to 8613 million in 2011 from 4705 million in 2010 in addition to the 2029 million pretax gain on the dispositions of big sandy and langley and the absence of revenues and expenses associated with these assets operating income was favorably impacted by increased production sales volumes and higher gathering and transmission revenues which more than offset the increase in operating expenses associated with higher volumes lower storage and marketing net operating revenues and a lower average wellhead sales price to eqt corporation 

  

production sales volumes increased more than 44 in 2011 from 2010 largely associated with the marcellus play as a result of increased production from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells gathered revenues increased as a result of a 32 increase in gathered volumes primarily related to the company’s production growth transmission net revenues increased as a result of higher firm transportation activity and capacity from the equitrans 2010 marcellus expansion project the average wellhead sales price to eqt corporation including the effect of the company’s hedging program was 537 per mcfe in 2011 compared to 562 per mcfe in 2010 hedging activities resulted in an increase in the average natural gas sales price of 055 per mcf in both 2011 and 2010 

  

  

operating expenses for 2011 increased 776 million compared to 2010 primarily as a result of increased production depletion and expenses on higher produced volumes as well as higher selling general and administrative expenses consistent with the growth of the business these increases were partially offset by the absence of expenses associated with big sandy and langley primarily operating and maintenance expenses and favorable adjustments for certain nonincome tax matters 

  

the 708 million increase in net income from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to increased production sales volumes higher gathering revenues increased net revenues for ngls lower longterm incentive compensation expense and lower exploration expense these favorable variances were partially offset by increased depreciation depletion and amortization lower average wellhead sales prices and lower storage and marketing revenues 

  

eqt revenues for 2010 increased approximately 5 compared to 2009 revenues production sales volumes increased more than 34 from 2009 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells gathered volumes increased due to the company’s production growth and infrastructure expansion residential revenues increased as a result of the company’s base rate increases in february 2009 and august 2010 these increases were partially offset by a 3 decline in the average wellhead sales price to eqt corporation as a result of lower hedge prices yearoveryear which more than offset slightly increased natural gas commodity and ngl prices and a 7 decline in storage and marketing revenues primarily resulting from lower margins on asset optimization activities 

  

operating expenses for 2010 decreased approximately 5 compared to 2009 this decline was primarily attributable to a 1080 million decrease in purchased gas costs due to lower recoverable commodity costs a 393 million decrease in longterm incentive compensation expense and a 125 million decrease in the company’s exploration program the decrease in exploration expense was primarily a result of a reduction in the level of purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties these decreases were partially offset by higher depletion resulting from increased investment in oil and gas producing properties

year ended december 31 2011 vs december 31 2010 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 3871 million for 2011 compared to 2235 million for 2010 an increase of 1636 million between years primarily due to increased production sales volumes and higher wellhead sales prices to eqt production partially offset by an increase in dda and operating costs resulting from higher volumes 

  

total net operating revenues were 7913 million for 2011 compared to 5377 million for 2010 the 2536 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a 44 increase in production sales volumes as well as a 3 increase in the average wellhead sales price to eqt production the increase in sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2010 and 2011 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus as well as the acquisition of producing properties associated with the anpi transaction as described in item 1 “business” in may 2011 which added 55 bcfe of sales volumes in 2011 this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells the 011 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price to eqt production was primarily due to lower gathering rates and higher sales prices for ngls and oil in the current year partially offset by an 8 decrease in the average nymex price compared to 2010 the average wellhead sales price was also impacted favorably from selling excess transmission capacity on the tennessee gas pipeline 300line in the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

operating expenses totaled 4042 million for 2011 compared to 3142 million for 2010 the 29 increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased dda production taxes and loe the depletion expense increased as a result of higher volumes in the current year partially offset by a slightly lower overall depletion rate production taxes increased due to higher revenues and increased assessments in certain jurisdictions that impose these taxes in the year of production the increase in loe was primarily the result of increased activity in 2011 as well as the elimination as part of the anpi transaction of certain operating expense reimbursement 

  

  

agreements lower costs for road and location maintenance due to less severe weather in the current year partly offset these increases sga increased due to higher overhead and commercial services costs associated with the growth of the company and higher franchise tax expense these increases were partially mitigated by a charge in 2010 related to the buyout of excess contractual capacity for water treatment and lower professional services hiring and relocation costs in 2011 

  

year ended december 31 2010 vs december 31 2009 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 2235 million for 2010 compared to 1859 million for 2009 an increase of 376 million between years primarily due to increased production sales volumes partially offset by a lower average wellhead sales price and an increase in depletion and sga expenses 

  

total operating revenues were 5377 million for 2010 compared to 4210 million for 2009 the 1167 million increase in operating revenues was due to increased sales volumes which more than offset lower average realized wellhead sales prices the increase in gas sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus and huron plays this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells the 018 per mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price to eqt production was primarily due to lower hedging gains and lower hedged gas sales volumes compared to 2009 partially offset by a 10 increase in the average nymex price and a higher sales price for ngls 

  

operating expenses totaled 3142 million for 2010 compared to 2351 million for 2009 the 34 increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increases of 663 million in dda 209 million in sga and 26 million in loe partially offset by a decrease of 125 million in exploration expense the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from increases in the blended depletion unit rate and volume the 020 per mcfe increase in the blended depletion unit rate was primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the increase in sga was primarily due to the reversal of reserves in the prior year for certain legal disputes higher personnel costs including incentive compensation and hiring and relocation costs a portion of which was recorded at headquarters in prior years a charge for the buyout of excess contractual capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water and an increase in professional fees despite the 20 decrease in the average loe per mcfe total loe increased as a result of increased activity in the marcellus play in the current year these factors were partially offset by a decrease in exploration expense due to a reduction in geophysical activity compared to the prior year as well as an impairment charge in 2009 on an exploratory utica well

year ended december 31 2011 vs december 31 2010 

  

eqt midstream’s operating income totaled 4166 million for 2011 including gains on the dispositions of langley and big sandy of 2029 million compared to 1789 million for 2010 in addition to the gains operating income increased as a result of increased gathering and transmission volumes combined with lower operating expenses these favorable variances were partially offset by decreased storage marketing and other net operating revenues and a lower average gathering fee 

  

total net operating revenues were 4046 million for 2011 compared to 3965 million for 2010 the increase in total net operating revenues was due to a 374 million increase in gathering net operating revenues and a 62 million increase in transmission net operating revenues partly offset by a 355 million decrease in storage marketing and other net operating revenues 

  

gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 32 increase in gathered volumes partially offset by a 13 decrease in the average gathering fee this increase in gathered volumes was driven primarily by higher produced natural gas volumes gathered for eqt production in the marcellus play the decrease in the average gathering fee was a result of lower gathering rates charged to affiliates and other shippers in the marcellus play 

  

transmission net revenues increased in 2011 as a result of higher firm transportation activity from affiliated shippers due to the increased marcellus volumes and increased capacity from the equitrans 2010 marcellus expansion project partly offset by the absence of revenues from the sold big sandy pipeline 

  

storage marketing and other net revenue decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in natural gas volumes marketed for third parties utilizing pipeline capacity lower net revenue from natural gas liquids marketed for nonaffiliated producers lower margins due to reduced commodity prices and lower price spreads and volatility higher ngl prices were more than offset by the loss of processing fees associated with the sale of langley 

  

total operating revenues decreased by 554 million or 10 primarily as a result of lower sales prices on decreased commercial activity and a lower gathering rate partially offset by an increase in gathered volumes and increased transmission revenue total purchased gas costs decreased as a result of decreased commercial activity 

  

operating expenses totaled 1909 million for 2011 compared to 2176 million for 2010 the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases of 237 million in om and 47 million in dda the decrease in om is primarily due to the absence of operating expenses associated with langley and big sandy and reductions in certain nonincome property tax reserves partly offset by increased compensation costs the decrease in dda was primarily due to the sales of big sandy and langley partly offset by increased depreciation on increased investment in gathering and compression infrastructure 

  

year ended december 31 2010 vs december 31 2009 

  

eqt midstream’s operating income totaled 1789 million for 2010 compared to 1542 million for 2009 the 247 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased gathering volumes and gathering rates partially offset by decreased storage marketing and other net operating revenues and increased operating expenses 

  

total net operating revenues were 3965 million for 2010 compared to 3498 million for 2009 the 467 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a 467 million increase in gathering net operating revenues and a 74 million increase in transmission net operating revenues partially offset by a 74 million decrease in storage marketing and other net operating revenues 

  

gathering net operating revenues increased due to a 21 increase in gathered volumes as well as a 7 increase in the average gathering fee the increased revenue was driven primarily by higher marcellus volumes from eqt production 

  

  

transmission net revenues in 2010 increased from the prior year primarily as a result of higher firm transportation activity from affiliated shippers due to the increased marcellus volumes and increased capacity from the equitrans 2010 marcellus expansion project which came online during the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

the decrease in storage marketing and other net revenues was primarily due to decreased margins and volumes of thirdparty marketing that utilized pipeline capacity less volatility in seasonal price spreads and decreased basis differentials which in 2009 had a positive impact on the company this decrease was partially offset by an increase in ngl processing net revenues primarily due to an increase in average ngl sales price 

  

total operating revenues increased by 1153 million or 25 primarily as a result of increased marketed volumes due to higher marcellus activity and higher gathered volumes total purchased gas costs also increased as a result of higher marcellus activity 

  

operating expenses totaled 2176 million for 2010 compared to 1956 million for 2009 the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases of 124 million in om and 86 million in dda the increase in om is primarily due to higher electricity labor and nonincome taxes associated with the growth of the business as well as a 26 million loss on compressor decommissioning at langley the increase in dda was primarily due to the increased investment in gathering and transmission infrastructure

year ended december 31 2011 vs december 31 2010 

  

distribution’s operating income totaled 869 million for 2011 compared to 832 million for 2010 the increase in operating income was primarily the result of an increase in estimated recoverable costs in 2011 an increase in the company’s west virginia base rates and lower operating expenses these increases were partly offset by warmer weather 

  

net operating revenues were 1876 million for 2011 compared to 1874 million for 2010 as an increase in estimated recoverable costs in 2011 was substantially offset by a decrease in residential net operating revenues net operating revenues from residential customers decreased 15 million as a result of warmer weather partially offset by the full year impact of the company’s west virginia base rate increase which was approved in august 2010 the weather in distribution’s service territory in 2011 was 6 warmer than 2010 and 9 warmer than the territory’s 30year national oceanic and atmospheric administration average commercial and industrial net revenues increased 04 million primarily as a result of an increase in usage by one industrial customer the high volume sales to this industrial customer had low unit margins and did not ratably impact total net operating 

  

  

revenues offsystem and energy services net operating revenues were higher as a result of a change in estimated recoverable costs in 2011 offset by fewer asset optimization opportunities realized in 2011 a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates and fewer asset optimization transactions resulted in a decrease in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs 

  

operating expenses totaled 1007 million for 2011 compared to 1042 million for 2010 the decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of lower bad debt expense and the reduction of certain nonincome tax reserves resulting from settlements with tax authorities these decreases were partially offset by an increase in other compensation related costs and depreciation expense in 2011 the decrease in bad debt expense was primarily the result of a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates and the company’s favorable collections experience 

  

year ended december 31 2010 vs december 31 2009 

  

distribution’s operating income totaled 832 million for 2010 compared to 789 million for 2009 the increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in base rates which was partially offset by higher operating expenses 

  

net operating revenues were 1874 million for 2010 compared to 1800 million for 2009 the 74 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily the result of an increase in residential net operating revenues net operating revenues from residential customers increased 64 million as a result of the approval of the company’s pennsylvania base rate increase in late february 2009 as well as the approval of the company’s west virginia base rate increase in august 2010 commercial and industrial net revenues increased 12 million due to higher base rates and an increase in performancebased revenues partially offset by a decrease in usage by one industrial customer high volume sales to this industrial customer had low unit margins and the decrease in sales volumes did not ratably impact total net operating revenues offsystem and energy services net operating revenues decreased due to lower margins on asset optimization activities partially offset by increased gathering revenue as a result of higher rates a decrease in the commodity component of residential tariff rates and a decrease in gas costs associated with asset optimization transactions resulted in a decrease in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs 

  

operating expenses totaled 1042 million for 2010 compared to 1011 million for 2009 the 31 million increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher bad debt and depreciation and amortization expense the increase in bad debt expense from 2009 to 2010 was primarily the result of a favorable onetime adjustment in the allowance for uncollectible accounts in 2009 due to the recovery of cap costs associated with the approval of the pennsylvania rate case settlement these increases were partially offset by an increase in accruals for certain nonincome tax reserves in 2009 and a decrease in incentive compensation costs in 2010 the increase in dda expense was primarily the result of increased capital expenditures 

  

other income statement items 

  

other income 

  

   

other income includes equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments primarily the company’s investment in nora gathering llc of 72 million 97 million and 65 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

other income increased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the 101 million pretax gain on the anpi transaction an 85 million gain on sales of availableforsale securities and an increase in the equity portion of afudc as a result of construction on the equitrans sunrise pipeline project 

  

other income for the year ended 2010 also included a 21 million gain on sales of availableforsale securities 

  

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense increased by 82 million from 2010 to 2011 as a result of the company’s continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during the year the increase in interest from the company’s november 2011 issuance of 750 million 4875 notes and the debt assumed in the may 2011 anpi transaction was partially offset by higher capitalized interest on increased marcellus well development the company also paid higher commitment fees under the terms of its 15 billion revolving credit facility entered into on december 8 2010 than under the previous facility 

  

interest expense increased by 164 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the full year of expense incurred on the 700 million of 8125 notes issued in may 2009 this increase was partially offset by a 44 million increase in capitalized interest primarily due to the capitalization of interest on marcellus well development beginning in 2010 reflecting the longer time to flow gas and increased investment associated with the multiwell pads 

  

weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s longterm debt were 68 68 and 65 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt were 181 07 and 07 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

  

   

income tax expense increased by 1518 million from 2010 to 2011 as a result of higher pretax income and an increase in the company’s effective income tax rate from 359 to 368 the company’s regulated business accounts for tax deductible repair costs as a permanent difference as the related deferred taxes are recoverable in rates the increase in the effective tax rate in 2011was primarily the result of the tax benefit for these repair costs being higher in 2010 than in 2011 state income taxes were also higher due to a shift in the company’s nonregulated business to states with higher income tax rates other rate reconciling items had a larger percentage impact on the effective tax rate in 2010 than 2011 due to significantly higher pretax income in 2011 

  

income tax expense increased by 309 million from 2009 to 2010 as a result of higher pretax income which was partly offset by a lower effective tax rate during 2010 the company’s effective income tax rate decreased from 381 to 359 the higher tax rate in 2009 was primarily the result of the impact in 2009 of certain nondeductible expenses and the loss of certain prior year deductions as a result of carrying 2009 losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid these higher rates in 2009 were partially mitigated by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes in 2009 rates were also lower in 2010 due to a reduction of the reserve for uncertain tax positions 

  

the company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss position for 2011 2010 and 2009 and expects to pay minimal federal income taxes for the next few years as the company’s drilling program in appalachia continues to generate intangible drilling cost deductions unless tax laws change or the company incurs a taxable gain from a discrete transaction in 2011 the sales of langley and big sandy resulted in the company paying federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes totaling approximately 496 million for federal income tax purposes the company deducts approximately 84 of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idc in the year incurred the primary reasons for the company’s net operating loss are the idc deduction resulting from the company’s drilling program and the accelerated tax deprecation for expansion of gathering infrastructure which 

  

  

provide tax deductions in excess of book deductions see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s income taxes 

  

outlook 

  

the company is committed to profitably developing its marcellus reserves through environmentally responsible costeffective technologicallyadvanced horizontal drilling the market price for natural gas can be volatile as demonstrated by significant declines in late 2011 and early 2012 in response to these lower prices the company has suspended drilling new huron wells wells currently in progress will be completed and turnedinline changes in the market price for natural gas impact the company’s revenues earnings and liquidity the company is unable to predict potential future movements in the market price for natural gas and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on its operations however the company monitors the market for natural gas and adjusts strategy and operations as deemed appropriate 

  

after adjusting for the change in drilling plans for 2012 capital expenditures for well development primarily drilling in 2012 are expected to be approximately 1055 million to support the drilling of approximately 158 gross wells including 146 gross marcellus wells and 12 gross huron wells which were either spud in january 2012 or are required to maintain lease rights sales volumes are expected to be between 250 and 255 bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 30 in 2012 

  

in addition the company plans to spend 365 million on midstream infrastructure in 2012 to support this production growth and expects gathering and transmission volumes to increase as a result of this expansion eqt midstream plans to add 445 mmcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity and 700 mmcfe per day of transmission capacity in 2012 this includes 300 mmcfe per day of transmission volumes from the sunrise pipeline project which is expected to go into service in 2012 

  

the company currently believes that the 2012 capital spending plan will be funded by cash flow generated from operations and cash on hand 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

the company’s primary sources of cash for 2011 were cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of senior debt and asset sales the company’s primary use of cash in 2011 was for capital expenditures 

  

operating activities 

  

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 was 9153 million compared to 7897 million for the same period of 2010 the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher operating receipts as a result of increased production in 2011 which more than offset the negative cash flow impact of paying 472 million in taxes in 2011 compared to receiving tax refunds of 1295 million in 2010 

  

the company’s net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was 7897 million compared to 7257 million for 2009 the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher earnings resulting from increased production volumes and higher ngl prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices 

  

investing activities 

  

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 6243 million for 2011 as compared to 12394 million for 2010 the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to 2011 proceeds from the sales of big sandy langley and availableforsale securities capital expenditures increased 273 million to 12743 million in 2011 see discussion of capital expenditures below 

  

  

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 12394 million for 2010 as compared to 9855 million for 2009 the increase in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures to 12469 million in 2010 from 9639 million in 2009 see discussion of capital expenditures below this increase was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and reduced capital contributions to nora gathering llc 

  

capital expenditures 

  

   

capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled 938 million and 888 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively the company drilled 222 gross wells 213 net wells in 2011 including 105 horizontal marcellus wells with approximately 500000 feet of pay and 115 horizontal huron wells with approximately 550000 feet of pay compared to 489 gross wells 395 net wells in 2010 including 90 horizontal marcellus wells with approximately 300000 feet of pay and 236 horizontal huron wells with approximately 10 million feet of pay capital expenditures for 2011 also included 57 million for undeveloped property acquisitions primarily within the marcellus play and 93 million of liabilities assumed in exchange for producing properties in the anpi transaction capital expenditures for 2010 included 358 million for undeveloped property acquisitions 231 million of which was noncash 

  

capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled 243 million for 2011 during the year eqt midstream turned inline 46 miles of pipeline and 20000 horse power of compression primarily in the marcellus play during 2010 midstream capital expenditures were 193 million eqt midstream turned inline 132 miles of pipeline and 21000 horse power of compression primarily within the huron play in 2010 

  

capital expenditures at distribution totaled 31 million and 37 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively principally for pipeline replacement 

  

the company is committed to profitably developing its marcellus reserves through environmentally responsible costeffective technologicallyadvanced horizontal drilling in response to lower prices the company suspended drilling new huron wells in january 2012 wells currently in progress will be completed and turnedinline after adjusting for the change in drilling plans for 2012 capital spending for well development primarily drilling is expected to be approximately 1055 million to support the drilling of approximately 158 gross wells including 146 gross marcellus wells and 12 huron wells which were either spud in january 2012 or are required to maintain lease rights sales volumes are expected to be between 250 and 255 bcfe for an anticipated production sales volume growth of approximately 30 in 2012 

  

in addition the company plans to spend 365 million on midstream infrastructure in 2012 to support its production growth and expects gathering and transmission volumes to increase as a result this expansion eqt midstream plans to add 445 mmcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity and 700 mmcfe per day of transmission capacity in 2012 this includes 300 mmcfe per day of transmission volumes from the sunrise pipeline project which is expected to go into service in 2012 

  

  

the company currently believes that 2012 capital expenditures will be funded by cash flow generated from operations and cash on hand 

  

financing activities 

  

cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 5403 million for 2011 as compared to 4497 million for 2010 during 2011 the company issued 750 million of 4875 senior notes due november 15 2021 the proceeds of these notes are to be used for general corporate purposes the company also repaid shortterm loans of 537 million in 2010 the company received 5372 million from a common stock offering 

  

cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 4497 million for 2010 as compared to 2598 million for 2009 as the proceeds from the 2010 equity offering exceeded the proceeds of the 2009 debt offering net of repayment of shortterm loans 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

eqt primarily utilizes shortterm borrowings to fund capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operating activities until they can be permanently financed to ensure sufficient levels of inventory and to fund required margin deposits on derivative commodity instruments the amount of shortterm borrowings used for inventory transactions is driven by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution and marketing operations margin deposit requirements vary based on natural gas commodity prices and the amount and type of derivative commodity instruments executed 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that matures on december 8 2014 the facility may be used for working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and any other lawful corporate purposes including support of any commercial paper program maintained by the company from time to time the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 20 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry 

  

as of december 31 2011 the company had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2010 the company had loans of 537 million and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of 235 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 the company paid commitment fees averaging approximately 30 basis points and 10 basis points respectively to maintain credit availability under the revolving credit facility 

  

the weighted average interest rate for shortterm loans outstanding as of december 31 2010 was 181 the maximum amount of outstanding shortterm loans at any time during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was 1040 million and 1397 million respectively the average daily balance of shortterm loans outstanding during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was approximately 55 million and 249 million respectively at weighted average annual interest rates of 181 and 070 respectively 

  

under the terms of the revolving credit facility the company may obtain base rate loans or fixed period eurodollar rate loans base rate loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the company’s then current credit rating fixed period eurodollar rate loans bear interest at a eurodollar rate plus a margin based on the company’s then current credit rating 

  

the company’s shortterm borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less 

  

security ratings and financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the credit ratings for debt instruments of the company at december 31 2011 changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm and longterm debt including interest rates

the company’s credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company’s ratings particularly below investment grade the company’s access to the capital markets may be limited margin deposits on derivative contracts and borrowing costs would increase counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease the required margin is subject to significant change as a result of factors other than credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the company 

  

the company’s debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that if not complied with could require early payment additional collateral support or similar actions the most significant default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s credit facility’s financial covenants require a total debttototal capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2011 the company was in compliance with all existing debt covenants 

  

commodity risk management 

  

the substantial majority of the company’s commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the company’s produced natural gas the company’s overall objective in this hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company’s risk management program may include the use of exchangetraded natural gas futures contracts and options and otc natural gas swap agreements and options collectively derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed prices swaps collars and futures

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005 the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco the savings guarantees provided that once the energyefficiency construction was completed by noresco the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees is approximately 213 million as of december 31 2011 extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 16 years in addition the company agreed to maintain in place certain outstanding payment and performance bonds letters of credit and other guarantee obligations supporting noresco’s obligations under certain customer contracts existing leases and other items with an undiscounted maximum exposure to the company as of december 31 2011 of approximately 35 million of which approximately 34 million relates to bonds that were to have been terminated as of december 31 2010 for work completed under the underlying contracts the company is working with noresco to resolve any open matters with respect to these bonds 

  

in exchange for the company’s agreement to maintain these guarantee obligations the purchaser of the noresco business and noresco agreed among other things that noresco would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and agreed to reimburse the company for any loss under the guarantee obligations provided that the purchaser’s reimbursement obligation will not exceed 6 million in the aggregate and will expire on november 18 2014 in 2008 the original purchaser of noresco sold its interest in noresco and transferred its obligations to a thirdparty in connection with that event the new owner delivered to the company a 1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations 

  

the noresco guarantees are exempt from fasb asc topic 460 guarantees the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential payments are expected to be immaterial to the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

  

rate regulation 

  

the company’s distribution operations transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed as described in notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the 

  

  

company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

   

purchase obligations primarily are commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines some of which extend up to approximately 15 years approximately 176 million and 35 million of these obligations payable in 2012 and 2013 respectively are believed to be recoverable in customer rates the company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity to various third parties amounts included in the above table for capacity released under longterm agreements approximate 618 million 475 million and 204 million in 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program the obligations for the company’s various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately 1101 million as of december 31 2011 the company has subleased some of these facilities sublease payments to the company total 302 million and are not netted from the amounts presented in the above table the company has agreements with savanna drilling llc pioneer drilling company and patterson drilling company to provide drilling equipment and services to the company over the next four years these obligations totaled approximately 902 million as of december 31 2011 

  

the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2011 value driver award program see section titled “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations 

  

as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total liability for the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2011 of 330 million of which 194 million reduces the net operating loss carryover the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations 

  

contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company accrues legal or other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company 

  

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon eqt’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities under this method all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves   if an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit the depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred the company estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties the estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable those properties would be written down to fair value which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

  

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made unproved properties had a net book value of 3588 million 4459 million and 1059 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which can be significantly impacted by management’s expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans should the company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and audited by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among 

  

  

other things reservoir performance development plans prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayof themonth price for each month within the 12month period operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans and pension and other postretirement benefits recorded in other comprehensive income the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if this step is satisfied then the company must measure the tax position the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit realizable upon ultimate settlement to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed in making this determination the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include 

  

  

an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

derivative commodity instruments  the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge natural gas inventory and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates energy trading contracts are also utilized to leverage assets and limit exposure to shifts in market prices derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings changes in the value of fair value hedges are offset with changes in the value of the hedged item inventory see “commodity risk management” above item 7a—“quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding hedging activities 

  

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use as inputs marketbased parameters including but not limited to forward curves discount rates broker quotes volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

a substantial majority of the company’s derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be dedesignated the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings which could materially impact the results of operations one of the requirements for cash flow hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged effectiveness may be impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective the company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads credit ratings credit default swap rates and market activity 

  

in addition the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements given the company’s price risk management position and price volatility the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices by changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of nonperformance risk and by changes in margin requirements future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

  

the company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company increases the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

share based compensation the company has awarded sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 longterm incentive plans the company treats certain of its programs as liability awards the actual cost to be recorded for these programs will not be known until the measurement date requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date the company reviews the assumptions for liability programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts awards that pay in stock are treated as equity awards these programs may require estimates of total number of shares to be issued depending on performance conditions or may be fixed because of a market condition fixed plans require the company to obtain a valuation which includes assumptions including the expected term of the award the riskfree rate and expected volatility based on the historical performance of the company and its peers 

  

effective in 2010 the company adopted the 2010 executive performance incentive program 2010 epip and the 2010 stock incentive award 2010 sia program the vesting of the units under the 2010 epip will occur upon payment after the end of the 3year performance period the payment will vary between zero and 300 of the number of units granted contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group over the threeyear period ending december 31 2012 and the level of production sales revenues over the period january 1 2010 through september 30 2012 if earned the 2010 epip units are expected to be distributed in company common stock the vesting of the awards under the 2010 sia will occur on the third anniversary of the grant date the number of awards granted was contingent upon adjusted 2010 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda performance as compared to the company’s annual business plan and individual business unit and company value driver performance over the period january 1 2010 through december 31 2010 as of december 31 2011 295635 confirmed performance awards were outstanding under the 2010 sia which are expected to be distributed in company common stock 

  

effective january 1 2011 the company adopted the 2011 volume and efficiency program 2011 vep and the 2011 value driver award program 2011 vda a total of 260330 awards were granted under the 2011 vep the payout of the 2011 vep awards will range from zero to three times the initial award based on the achievement of predetermined specified performance measures payment of the awards is expected to be distributed in company stock after the end of the performance period december 31 2013 the company accounts for these awards as equity awards using the 4809 grant date fair value which was equal to the company’s stock price at the grant date of the award 

  

under the 2011vda 50 of the units awarded vested upon the payment date following the first anniversary of the grant date the remaining 50 of the units awarded will vest upon the payment date following the second anniversary of the grant date the payment under this plan varied between zero and 300 of the number of units granted contingent upon adjusted 2011 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda performance as compared to the company’s annual business plan and individual business unit and company value 

  

  

driver performance over the period january 1 2011 through december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 523347 confirmed awards were outstanding under the 2011 vda half of the awards were distributed in cash in february 2012 the remainder of the awards are expected to vest and be paid in cash in the first quarter of 2013 

  

effective 2012 the company adopted the 2012 value driver award program 2012 vda and the 2012 executive performance incentive program 2012 epip the company may adopt other plans in the future the company has not recorded an obligation under the 2012 vda the 2012 epip or any potential future plans at december 31 2011 

  

the 2009 longterm incentive plan permits and the 1999 longterm incentive plan permitted the grant of restricted stock awards and nonqualified stock options to employees of the company for time restricted stock awards compensation expense which is based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the majority of the timebased restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the threeyear period commencing with the date of grant for nonqualified stock options compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s stock expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company’s shares future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative commodity instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through eqt production and the storage marketing and other activities at eqt midstream the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k the company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is regularly monitored the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge other forecasted natural gas purchases and sales to hedge natural gas inventory and to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates the company’s use of derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

commodity price risk 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk and to hedge natural gas inventory which is exposed to changes in fair value the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels 

  

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity the company also considers other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

  

the company monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and makes adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2011 the company hedged portions of expected equity production portions of forecasted purchases and sales and portions of natural gas inventory by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 347 bcf of natural gas see the “commodity risk management” in the “capital resources and liquidity” sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k for further discussion 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2011 levels would increase the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1291 million a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2011 levels would decrease the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1281 million 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the price change was then applied to the nontrading natural gas derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

interest rate risk 

  

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest the company earns on cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest rate it pays on borrowings under the revolving credit facility all of the company’s longterm borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose the company to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s borrowings and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements including the fair value of longterm debt in august 2011 the company entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this swap 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value which may change as market prices change the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have limited credit risk because the commodity futures trading commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the 

  

  

company from any potential financial instability of the exchange members the company’s swap and collar derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole 

  

the company utilizes various processes and analysis to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures this includes monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 81 or 5085 million of otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2011 have a positive fair value all derivative contracts outstanding were with counterparties having an sp rating of a or above on december 31 2011 

  

as of december 31 2011 the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and has no knowledge of default by any counterparty to derivative contracts the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas ngls and crude oil to marketers utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area and a gas processor in kentucky additionally a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt midstream are generated from the gathering of natural gas in kentucky virginia pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that matures on december 8 2014 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 20 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company as of december 31 2011 the company had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the facility no single lender of the 20 financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry

eqt’s proved reserves increased by 28 in 2010 and by 121 over the past five years while the company’s cost structure remained at an industry leading level eqt’s 2010 finding and development cost is among the lowest in the industry at 070 per mcfe as of december 31 2010 the company’s proved reserves including proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the resource plays to which the reserves relate are as follows 

  

   

 the company includes the lower huron cleveland berea sandstone and other devonian shales except marcellus in its huron play also included in the huron play is 705 bcfe of reserves from nonshale formations accessed through vertical wells 

  

a key assumption in booking proved undeveloped reserves is the company’s 5year capital investment estimate the fiveyear plan used in estimating the company’s proved reserves anticipates drilling expenditures of 25 billion which is consistent with the pace of development that the company believes can be funded using the production segment’s portion of internallygenerated cash flows and does not require additional capital infusions or asset sales assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2010 the remaining reserve life of the company’s total proved reserves as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by current year produced volumes is in excess of 37 years 

  

the company’s natural gas wells are generally lowrisk with long lives and low development and production costs the gas produced from these wells has a high energy content and is within close proximity to natural gas markets many of these wells have been producing for decades with several in production since early in the 20 th century also the gas produced from most of the company’s huron wells and some of its marcellus shale wells is liquidsrich 

  

in the marcellus shale play eqt applies proprietary extended lateral horizontal drilling technology to its approximate 520000 acres and 29 tcfe of proved reserves marcellus shale wells target depths ranging from 7000 to 8000 feet with an average lateral spacing of 1000 feet 

  

  

eqt is also focusing its highly successful horizontal drilling program in the huron play where the company has approximately 27 million acres and 22 tcfe of proved reserves this technology has been used in fractured horizontal single lateral wells stacked horizontal wells and extended lateral wells wells in the huron play are drilled to depths ranging from 2500 to 6500 feet with an average lateral spacing of 1000 feet 

  

less than 5 of the company’s proved reserves are attributable to cbm as of december 31 2010 substantially all of the company’s cbm wells are drilled vertically and do not contain natural gas liquids 

  

horizontal wells drilled by the company over the past five years are as follows 

  

   

the company invested approximately 888 million on well development primarily drilling in 2010 sales volumes increased 34 in 2010 over 2009 

  

during 2010 the company acquired approximately 58000 net acres in the marcellus shale from a group of private operators and landowners the acreage is located primarily in cameron clearfield elk and jefferson counties in pennsylvania the purchase included a 200 mile gathering system with associated rights of way and approximately 100 producing vertical wells 

  

to support the growth of the marcellus shale play the company is increasing its available gathering and transmission system capacity in the region during 2010 the company completed construction of the ingram gathering system which added 4800 horsepower of compression and 105 mmcfe per day of delivery capacity to equitrans lp equitrans eqt’s interstate pipeline subsidiary piplines for eqt production in greene county pennsylvania equitrans has a total pennsylvania gathering capacity of 130 mmcfe in northern west virginia eqt completed the doddridge gathering system expansion which is capable of delivering 60 mmcfe per day of eqt’s production from north central west virginia into the western leg of the equitrans system this brings total marcellus shale gathering capacity in west virginia to approximately 85 mmcfe per day equitrans also completed phase 1 of the equitrans marcellus expansion project which added approximately 100000 dth per day of new delivery capacity to equitrans’ interconnections with five interstate pipeline facilities texas eastern transmission columbia gas transmission national fuel gas supply tennessee gas pipeline and dominion transmission 

  

also the company has approximately 10900 miles of gathering lines and 770 miles of transmission lines eqt’s 14 natural gas storage reservoirs provide approximately 500 mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 63 bcf of storage capacity of which 32 bcf is working gas eqt’s storage reservoirs are clustered in two geographic areas connected to its equitrans pipeline with eight in northern west virginia and six in southwestern pennsylvania 

  

through eqt’s gas marketing subsidiary eqt energy llc eqt energy the company provides optimization of capacity and storage assets ngl sales and gas sales to commercial and industrial customers within its operational footprint through 82 bcf of leased storage related assets and approximately 420000 dth per day of contractual pipeline capacity from third parties 

  

at december 31 2010 eqt also owned and operated kentucky hydrocarbon a gas processing facility in langley kentucky on february 1 2011 eqt midstream sold the processing facility and associated ngl pipeline 

  

  

to markwest energy partners lp markwest for 230 million subject to customary purchase price adjustments markwest agreed to commence the installation of a new 60 mmcfd cryogenic processing plant to expand the langley cryogenic processing capacity in conjunction with the closing of the sale of the langley plant eqt executed a longterm agreement with markwest to provide processing services for its kentucky huron shale gas and extended its existing agreement with markwest for ngl transportation fractionation and marketing services until 2022 in addition markwest has agreed to construct a natural gas processing facility in logansport wv by the second quarter of 2012 markwest will then provide natural gas processing services for eqt’s marcellus shale production in north central west virginia as well as ngl transportation fractionation and marketing services 

  

in 2008 eqt energy executed a binding precedent agreement with tennessee gas pipeline company tgp a wholly owned subsidiary of el paso corporation for a 15year term that awarded the company capacity in tgp’s 300line expansion project eqt energy’s capacity in the project is expected to be 350000 dth per day giving eqt access to consumer markets from the gulf coast to the midatlantic and the northeast tgp’s expected turn in line date for the 300line expansion project is late 2011 

  

capital spending for well development primarily drilling in 2011 is expected to be approximately 691 million to support the drilling of up to 167 gross wells including 86 gross marcellus shale wells and approximately 244 million for midstream infrastructure sales volumes are expected to exceed 175 bcfe for an anticipated natural gas sales volume growth of 30 in 2011 a substantial portion of the company’s 2011 drilling efforts are expected to be focused on drilling extended lateral marcellus shale wells the company currently believes that the capital spending plan will not require the company to access capital markets through the end of the year 

  

strategy 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing the company’s substantial acreage position enabled by the company’s extensive gathering and transmission assets low cost structure close proximity to the northeastern united states markets and the high btu content of much of its produced natural gas the company is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its developmental drilling program particularly in the marcellus shale the company is also investing in developmental geological and geophysical studies to optimize well placement 

  

the company believes that it is a technological leader in drilling shale in the marcellus shale play eqt production believes its state of the art drilling and completion techniques have produced industry leading results in the huron play the use of air in horizontal drilling has proven to be a cost effective technology which the company has efficiently deployed in both plays the company has used technology to increase lateral length recoveries from extended laterals have been proportional to the length increase these industry leading processes have also allowed the company to reduce development costs based on these favorable results the company has incorporated extended lateral wells into its preferred standard operating procedures for the marcellus and huron shale plays the company expects to continue increasing the average lateral length in the marcellus shale lateral lengths will be limited by lease boundaries unless the company is able to pool acreage with neighboring leaseholders 

  

because substantially all of the company’s acreage is held by production or in fee eqt production is able to develop its acreage in the most economic manner rather than focusing on drilling less economic wells in order to retain acreage additionally the company continues to demonstrate the quality of its marcellus shale acreage with recent successful wells in north central west virginia and central pennsylvania the company’s core development area in greene county pennsylvania continues to produce industry leading marcellus shale results in terms of initial production rates and finding and development costs 

  

the company believes the location of the company’s midstream assets across a wide area of the marcellus shale in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia uniquely positions the company for growth in support of the marcellus shale growth eqt midstream strives to increase gathering capacity and improve capital efficiency by utilizing existing high pressure assets and completing modular compression construction in west virginia completion of a compression facility has added significant capacity in the core doddridge county area that the company expects to develop in 2011 

  

  

in 2011 eqt plans to continue its investment in gathering and transmission capacity in the highpotential marcellus shale area this investment includes 130 mmcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity in addition over the next two years the equitrans marcellus expansion project is expected to add approximately 550 mmcfe per day of incremental transmission capacity the combination of these investments with the existing assets in the huron region provide a platform for sales growth and will help to mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the company’s gathering systems in transporting gas to market 

  

in light of the anticipated marcellus shale production growth the company is also considering partnering with third parties and other arrangements including a potential sale of the big sandy pipeline to unlock the value of mature assets and redeploy such value into highergrowth marcellus shale development 

  

the company is also helping to build demand for natural gas as a result of the 700000 grant received from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection equitable gas will be constructing a publicaccess natural gas fueling station in pittsburgh pa in conjunction with this project the company is promoting the use of ngv fleet vehicles distribution is actively increasing the supply of locally produced marcellus shale gas flowing to its customers and assisting customers to obtain incentives and rebates as a result of conversions to natural gas from other fuel sources

markets and customers 

  

natural gas sales   eqt’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas can be volatile as evidenced by the significant increase in natural gas prices in early through mid 2008 followed by decreases later in 2008 and in 2009 the market price for gas located in the appalachian basin is generally higher than the price for gas located in the gulf coast largely due to the differential in the cost to transport gas to customers in the northeastern united states in order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements no single customer accounted for more than 10 of revenues in 2010 or 2009 sales to one thirdparty marketer accounted for approximately 13 of revenues for eqt production for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

ngl sales   as of december 31 2010 the company processed natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas ngls were recovered at eqt’s kentucky hydrocarbon facility and transported to a fractionation plant owned by a thirdparty for separation into commercial components the thirdparty marketed these components for a fee the company also had contractual processing arrangements whereby the company sold gas to a thirdparty processor at a weighted average liquids component price subsequent to the closing of the sale of the kentucky hydrocarbon facility to markwest the processing of the company’s produced natural gas has been performed by a thirdparty vendor 

  

  

average wellhead sales price 

  

   

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to geographically diverse markets 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2010 totaled 195642 bbtu of which approximately 67 related to gathering for eqt production 19 related to thirdparty volumes and 2 related to volumes for other subsidiaries of the company the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company continued to operate for a fee revenues from other subsidiaries accounted for approximately 85 of 2010 gathering revenues 

  

natural gas transmission and storage services offered by eqt energy include commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services including the processing of natural gas liquids for third parties these operations are executed using company owned and operated or contracted transmission and underground storage facilities as well as other contractual capacity arrangements with major pipeline and storage service providers in the eastern united states eqt energy uses leased storage capacity and firm transportation capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities eqt energy also engages in risk management and energy trading activities for the company the objective of these activities is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets 

  

customers of eqt midstream’s gas transportation storage risk management and related services are affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and ugi energy services inc eqt energy’s commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services are offered to natural gas producers and energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers 

  

equitrans’ firm transportation contracts expire between 2011 and 2023 the company anticipates that the capacity associated with these expiring contracts will be remarketed or used by affiliates such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed in 2010 approximately 85 of transportation volumes and approximately 89 of transportation revenues were from affiliates 

  

natural gas distribution the company’s distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 276500 customers consisting of 257900 residential customers and 18600 commercial and industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia these service areas have a rather static population and economy 

  

equitable gas purchases gas through contracts with various sources including major and independent producers in the gulf coast local producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate the gas purchase contracts contain various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices the cost of purchased gas is equitable gas’ largest operating expense and is passed through to customers utilizing mechanisms approved by the pa puc and wv psc equitable gas is not permitted to profit from fluctuations in gas costs 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 71 of calendar year 2010 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in 

  

  

underground storage inventory during the offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

  

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include independent oil and gas companies major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators key competitors for new gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies natural gas marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers as a regulated utility the company’s distribution operation experiences only limited competition with other local distribution companies in its operating area but experiences usuage pressures as a result of alternative fuels and conservation 

  

regulation 

  

regulation of the company’s operations 

  

eqt production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells the method of drilling well construction and casing design water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the plugging and abandoning of wells the calculation reporting and disbursement of taxes and the gathering of production in certain circumstances such as safety regulations these regulations may impact the costs of developing the company’s natural gas resources 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties both kentucky and virginia allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration while in west virginia and pennsylvania it is necessary to rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas 

  

eqt midstream has both nonregulated and regulated operations the interstate natural gas transmission systems and storage operations are regulated by the ferc for instance the ferc approves tariffs that establish equitrans’ rates cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service to equitrans’ customers the fees or rates established under equitrans’ tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers including a reasonable return on invested capital the ferc’s authority also extends to storage and related services certification and construction of new facilities extension or abandonment of services and facilities maintenance of accounts and records relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates terms and conditions of service depreciation and amortization policies acquisition and disposition of facilities the safety of pipelines and initiation and discontinuation of services 

  

eqt production and eqt midstream each engage in natural gas trading activities which are regulated by among others the united states commodity futures trading commission “cftc” in july 2010 federal legislation was enacted to implement various financial and governance reforms although many of the legislative provisions were focused on the financial and banking industries portions of the legislation may impact the company’s natural gas trading activities the extent of the impact is uncertain at this time because various implementing regulations are yet to be adopted by the sec and the cftc 

  

equitable gas’ distribution rates terms of service and contracts with affiliates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the wv psc the field line sales rates in kentucky are subject to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission 

  

  

equitable gas must usually seek the approval of one or more of its regulators prior to changing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and transportation activities equitable gas is allowed to recover a return in addition to the costs of its distribution and gathering delivery activities however equitable gas’ regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term on august 24 2010 the wv psc approved a settlement between equitable gas and certain parties with respect to a base rate increase in west virginia equitable gas implemented the new base rates in the third quarter of 2010 

  

as required by pennsylvania law equitable gas has a customer assistance program that assists lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the cost of this program is recovered through rates charged to other residential customers 

  

regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however laws and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry are frequently amended or reinterpreted moreover the recent oil spill in the gulf of mexico and explosion of a natural gas transmission line in california may lead to new regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations therefore the company is unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress the states regulatory agencies and the courts the company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 

  

environmental health and safety regulation 

  

the business operations of the company are also subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to among other things the release emission or discharge of materials into the environment the generation storage transportation handling and disposal of materials including solid and hazardous wastes the safety of employees and the general public or otherwise relating to pollution preservation remediation or protection of human health and safety natural resources wildlife or the environment the company must take into account environmental health and safety regulations in among other things planning designing constructing drilling operating and abandoning wells and related surface facilities in most instances the regulatory frameworks relate to the handling of drilling and production materials the disposal of drilling and production wastes the protection of water and air and the protection of people 

  

the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material to the company’s financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations it is customary in the company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks or fractures in formations underground where water sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation these formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by protective rock layers the company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing if passed into law the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to obtain permits for or to construct wells 

  

climate change 

  

legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation effective january 1 2011 the epa began regulating greenhouse gas 

  

  

emissions by subjecting new facilities and major modifications to existing facilities that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to the permitting requirements of the federal clean air act in addition the us congress has been considering bills that would establish a capandtrade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities andor purchase emission allowances climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements conversely legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated than other fuels such as coal the effect on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 

  

employees 

  

the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1815 employees at the end of 2010 as of december 31 2010 approximately 12 of the company’s workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements and the collective bargaining agreement which covers approximately 9 of the company’s workforce is scheduled to expire during september 2011 

  

holding company reorganization 

  

on june 30 2008 the former equitable resources inc old eqt entered into and completed an agreement and plan of merger the plan under which old eqt reorganized into a holding company structure such that a newly formed pennsylvania corporation also named equitable resources inc new eqt became the publicly traded holding company of old eqt and its subsidiaries the primary purpose of this reorganization the reorganization was to separate old eqt’s stateregulated distribution operations into a new subsidiary in order to better segregate its regulated and unregulated businesses and improve overall financing flexibility to effect the reorganization old eqt formed new eqt a whollyowned subsidiary and new eqt in turn formed egc merger co a pennsylvania corporation owned solely by new eqt mergersub under the plan mergersub merged with and into old eqt with old eqt surviving the merger the merger resulted in old eqt becoming a direct whollyowned subsidiary of new eqt new eqt changed its name to eqt corporation effective february 9 2009 throughout this annual report references to eqt eqt corporation and the company refer collectively to new eqt and its consolidated subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect upon our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the proximity to and availability of capacity on transportation facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

  

lower natural gas prices may result in decreases in the revenue margin and cash flow for each of our businesses a reduction in the construction of new transportation capacity and downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves which may cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings moreover if we fail to control our operating costs during periods of lower natural gas prices we could further reduce our margin a reduction in margin or cash flow will reduce our funds available for capital expenditures and correspondingly our opportunities for growth we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value 

  

increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap collar and option agreements and exchange traded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

  

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation storage and distribution of natural gas and natural gas liquids these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage as a result we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

  

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things the recent oil spill in the gulf of mexico the explosion of a natural gas transmission line in california and concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing may lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations which may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

  

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

  

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our 2011 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity midstream infrastructure distribution infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2011 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected 

  

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the gas to market successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect in addition our exploration projects increase the risks inherent in our natural gas activities specifically seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our operations because we have a limited operating history in certain areas our future operating results may be difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

  

we rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings 

  

  

any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity we cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish financial results 

  

the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering systems pipelines and distribution systems environmental health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may increase our cost of doing business these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages 

  

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are in many cases subject to state or federal regulation the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming for instance effective january 1 2011 the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emission by subjecting new facilities and major modifications to existing facilities that emit large emissions of greenhouse gas emissions to the permitting requirements of the federal clean air act 

  

in addition the us congress and various states have been evaluating climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on and the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

  

in addition hydraulic fracturing is utilized to complete most of our natural gas wells certain environmental and other groups have suggested that additional laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process and legislation has been proposed by some members of congress to provide for such regulation we cannot predict whether any such federal or state legislation or regulation will be enacted and if enacted how they may impact our operations but enactment of additional laws or regulations could increase our operating costs 

  

recent federal budget proposals have included provisions which could potentially increase and accelerate the payment of federal income taxes of independent producers of natural gas and oil proposals that would significantly affect us would repeal the expensing of intangible drilling costs repeal the percentage depletion allowance and increase the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses these changes if enacted will make it more costly for us to explore for and develop our natural gas resources 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability 

  

in july 2010 federal legislation was enacted to implement various financial and governance reforms although many of the legislative provisions were focused on the financial and banking industries portions of the legislation will impact our businesses the extent of the impact is uncertain at this time due to the requirement that various implementing regulations must be adopted by the sec and the united states commodity futures trading commission 

  

our failure to develop or obtain and maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of gas depends upon the availability of adequate transportation infrastructure the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as processing adjacent to and curtailments on such pipelines the lack of midstream infrastructure could become more important in the geographic area in which the marcellus shale is being developed our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors we also deliver to and are served by thirdparty gas gathering transportation processing and storage facilities which are limited in number and geographically concentrated an extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities could result in adverse consequences to us in addition some of our thirdparty contracts may involve significant financial commitments on our part and may make us dependent upon others to get our produced natural gas to market 

  

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic operational and financial plans 

  

our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition the success of our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract develop and retain experienced personnel there is competition within our industry for experienced personnel and certain other professionals if we cannot attract develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel our ability to compete could be harmed

 item 2 properties 

  

principal facilities are owned or in the case of certain office locations warehouse buildings and equipment leased by the company’s business segments the majority of the company’s properties are located on or under 1 private properties owned in fee held by lease or occupied under perpetual easements or other rights acquired for the most part without warranty of underlying land titles or 2 public highways under franchises or permits from various governmental authorities the company’s facilities are generally well maintained and where appropriate are replaced or expanded to meet operating requirements 

  

eqt production eqt production’s properties are located primarily in kentucky west virginia virginia and pennsylvania this segment currently has approximately 35 million gross acres approximately 63 of which are considered undeveloped which encompasses substantially all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil production properties although most of its wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths 2000 to 8000 feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2010 the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 5220 bcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 2177 bcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 358 bcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 2685 bcfe substantially all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves are prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for the technical aspects of the reserves audit has received a bachelor’s degree in engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has thirteen years of experience in the oil and gas industry to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve roll forward between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management 

  

the company’s estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves is audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp ryder scott which is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally ryder scott’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 9901 

  

no report has been filed with any federal authority or agency reflecting a 5 or more difference from the company’s estimated total reserves additional information relating to the company’s estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows is provided in note 22 unaudited to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in 2010 the company commenced drilling operations “spud” or “drilled” on 90 gross horizontal wells with an aggregate of approximately 300000 feet of pay in the marcellus shale play total proved reserves in the marcellus shale play increased 171 to 29 tcfe proved reserves increased in the marcellus shale play as a result of the company’s 2010 drilling program in the huron play the company drilled 236 gross horizontal wells with an aggregate of approximately 10 million feet of pay during 2010 total proved reserves in the huron play including vertical nonshale formations decreased 22 to 22 tcfe the company drilled 95 gross cbm wells in 2010 the cbm play had total proved reserves of 02 tcfe at december 31 2010 down 25 from 2009 proved reserves decreased in the huron and cbm plays as the company plans to focus its capital expenditures during the next five years on developing the marcellus shale play sales of produced natural gas in 2010 from the marcellus shale huron and cbm plays were 255 bcfe 956 bcfe and 135 bcfe respectively over the past three years the company has experienced a 996 developmental drilling success rate 

  

  

  

natural gas ngl and crude oil production and pricing 

  

   

the company’s average per unit production cost excluding severance taxes of natural gas and crude oil during 2010 2009 and 2008 was 024 030 and 035 per mcfe respectively 

  

   

   

certain lease acquisition agreements require the company to drill 5 wells drilled to 250’ above the top of the tully formation or deeper plus 4 wells to any depth or formation in 2011 and 5 wells drilled to 250’ above the top of the tully formation or deeper plus 2 wells to any depth or formation in 2012 each of these wells must be drilled within specified acreage the company intends to satisfy these requirements as part of its marcellus shale development program as of december 31 2010 leases associated with 16431 gross undeveloped acres expire in 2011 if they are not renewed however the company has an active lease renewal program

selected data by state at december 31 2010 unless otherwise noted 

  

   

during 2010 the company converted 249 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves and 362 bcfe of nonproved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves the fiveyear plan used in estimating proved reserves anticipates drilling expenditures of 25 billion to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves this level of spending is consistent with the pace of development that the company believes can be funded using the production segment’s portion of internallygenerated cash flows and does not require additional capital infusions or asset sales capital expenditures at eqt production totaled 1246 million during 2010 including 3577 million for the acquisition of undeveloped property as a result of the company’s 2010 drilling program the increase in proved reserves was primarily due to increases in the marcellus shale play offset by decreases in the huron and cbm plays 

  

the company’s 2010 extensions discoveries and other additions resulting from extensions of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery of 1893 bcfe exceeded the 2010 production of 1390 bcfe 

  

during 2010 the company recorded downward revisions of 604 bcfe to the december 31 2009 estimate of proved reserves due to removing pud locations in the huron play in order to focus more capital and resources in the marcellus shale play over the fiveyear time horizon included in the pud development plan these downward 

  

  

revisions were partially offset by increased prices the reserves were computed using unweighted arithmetic averages of the closing prices on the first day of each month during 2010 although proved reserves are sensitive to price volatility the impact to the company should be minimal due to the company’s low cost structure instead proved reserve quantities are confined by the capital available for the development program within the next 5 years 

  

wells located in kentucky are primarily in huron shale formation with depths ranging from 2500 feet to 6000 feet wells located in west virginia are primarily in huron and marcellus shale formations with depths ranging from 2500 feet to 6500 feet wells located in virginia are primarily in coalbed methane formations with depths ranging from 2000 feet to 3000 feet wells located in pennsylvania are primarily in marcellus shale formations with depths ranging from 7000 feet to 8000 feet

consolidated results of operations 

  

in 2010 eqt achieved record results highlights for 2010 include 

  

·   record annual sales of produced natural gas of 1346 bcfe more than 34 higher than 2009 

·   a 28 increase in proved reserves to 52 tcfe 

·   the company drilled 489 gross wells during 2010 of which 326 were horizontal wells 90 targeting the marcellus shale play and 236 targeting the huron play 

·   the company was successful on more than 996 of the wells drilled in 2010 

·   achieved 20 decrease in unit lease operating expense loe excluding production taxes to 024 per mcfe including production taxes loe was 048 per mcfe 

·   record eqt midstream throughput and operating income and 

·   record distribution operating income of 832 million 5 higher than 2009 

  

eqt’s consolidated net income for 2010 was 2277 million 157 per diluted share compared with 1569 million 119 per diluted share for 2009 and 2556 million 200 per diluted share for 2008 

  

the 708 million increase in net income from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to increased produced natural gas sales volumes higher gathering revenues increased net revenues for ngls lower longterm incentive compensation expense and lower exploration expense these favorable variances were partially offset by increased depreciation depletion and amortization lower average wellhead sales prices lower storage and marketing revenues and higher interest expense 

  

eqt revenues for 2010 increased approximately 4 compared to 2009 revenues gas sales volumes increased more than 34 from 2009 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells gathered volumes increased due to the company’s production growth and infrastructure expansion and ngl sales revenues increased as a result of an increase in ngl sales price as well as an increase in ngls sold residential revenues increased as a result of the company’s base rate increases in february 2009 and august 2010 these increases were partially offset by a 4 decline in the average wellhead sales price as a result of lower hedge prices yearoveryear which more than offset slightly increased commodity market prices and a 7 decline in storage and marketing revenues primarily resulting from lower margins on pipeline capacity 

  

  

operating expenses for 2010 decreased approximately 7 compared to 2009 this decline was primarily attributable to a 1182 million decrease in purchased gas costs due to lower recoverable commodity costs a 393 million decrease in longterm incentive compensation expense primarily due to the company’s share price and performance in relation to its peer group which resulted in 618 million of expense in 2009 and a 125 million decrease in the company’s exploration program the decrease in exploration expense is primarily a result of a reduction in the level of purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties these decreases were partially offset by higher depletion resulting from increased investment in oil and gas producing properties 

  

the 987 million decrease in net income from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a lower average wellhead sales price increased incentive compensation expense increased depletion expense and higher interest expense partially offset by increased gas and ngl sales volumes at eqt production increased gathering revenues big sandy pipeline activity at eqt midstream and an increase in base rates in the distribution segment 

  

incentive compensation expense increased from 2008 to 2009 and decreased from 2009 to 2010 as a result of expenses related to the company’s 2009 shareholder value plan recorded in 2009 and a reversal of previously recorded expense on the company’s 2005 executive performance incentive program in 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in the company’s stock price in 2008 incentive compensation is primarily reported in selling general and administrative expenses in the statements of consolidated income a significant portion of the 2009 expense and 2008 reversal are reported as unallocated expenses in the information by business segment in note 2 of the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

interest expense increased from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the company’s continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure this investment was partially funded by the issuance of 700 million of 8125 notes in may 2009

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive compensation expenses income and administrative expenses totaling 151 million 622 million and 174 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively were not allocated to business segments the unallocated expenses in 2010 and 2009 primarily relate to performancerelated incentive compensation expenses while the unallocated income in 2008 primarily relates to the reversal of previously recorded performancerelated incentive compensation expenses 

  

the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the company’s consolidated operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income totals in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements additionally these subtotals are reconciled to the company’s consolidated net income in note 2 the company has also reported the components of each segment’s operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived eqt’s management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition operations and trends of each of eqt’s segments without being obscured by these items for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes 

  

on february 1 2011 the company sold its natural gas processing complex in langley kentucky subsequent to the closing of this sale the processing of the company’s produced natural gas has been performed by a thirdparty vendor the revenue received as a result of the fractionation of ngls which were extracted from 

  

  

the company’s produced natural gas frac spread was previously reported in the eqt midstream segment in conjunction with the results of the processing activities as a result of the sale of the company’s processing assets management determined that this frac spread would be reported in the eqt production segment as additional revenue for its produced ngl sales the segment disclosures and discussions contained in this report have been reclassified to reflect all periods presented under the new methodology in conjunction with the closing of the sale the company executed a longterm agreement to receive processing services for its kentucky huron shale gas and extended its existing agreement for ngl transportation fractionation and marketing services until 2022 expenses incurred during 2010 to operate the langley processing complex excluding dda were 202 million if the natural gas volumes processed by the langley facility in 2010 would have been processed by a thirdparty the company would have incurred approximately 351 million in processing fees and expenses

fiscal year ended december 31 2010 vs december 31 2009 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 2235 million for 2010 compared to 1859 million for 2009 an increase of 376 million between years primarily due to increased sales volumes of produced natural gas ngl and crude oil partially offset by a lower average wellhead sales price and an increase in depletion and sga expenses 

  

total operating revenues were 5377 million for 2010 compared to 4210 million for 2009 the 1167 million increase in operating revenues was due to increased sales volumes which more than offset lower realized prices the increase in produced natural gas sales volumes was the result of increased production from the 2009 and 2010 drilling programs primarily in the marcellus and huron shale plays this increase was partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells the 018 per mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price was primarily due to lower hedging gains and lower hedged gas sales compared to 2009 partially offset by a 10 increase in the average nymex price and a higher sales price for ngls 

  

operating expenses totaled 3142 million for 2010 compared to 2351 million for 2009 the 34 increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increases of 663 million in dda 209 million in sga 26 

  

  

million in loe partially offset by a decrease of 125 million in exploration expense the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate 256 million and volume 382 million the 020 per mcfe increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the increase in sga was primarily due to the reversal of reserves in the prior year for certain legal disputes higher personnel costs including incentive compensation and hiring and relocation costs a portion of which were recorded at headquarters in prior years a charge for the buyout of excess contractual capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water and an increase in professional fees despite the 20 decrease in the average loe per mcfe total loe increased as a result of increased activity in the marcellus shale play in the current year these factors were partially offset by a decrease in exploration expense due to a reduction in geophysical activity compared to the prior year as well as an impairment charge in 2009 on an exploratory utica well 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2009 vs december 31 2008 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 1859 million for 2009 compared to 2676 million for 2008 a decrease of 31 between years primarily due to a lower average wellhead sales price and an increase in depletion expense partially offset by increased sales volumes 

  

total operating revenues were 4210 million for 2009 compared to 4730 million for 2008 the decrease in operating revenues was due to lower realized prices which more than offset increased sales volumes the average wellhead sales price decreased by 140 per mcfe primarily as a result of a 56 decrease in nymex natural gas prices a 36 lower sales price for ngls and a lower percentage of hedged gas sales partially offset by a higher realized hedge price the decrease in prices was partially offset by increased sales volumes of more than 19 as a result of the 2008 and 2009 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the company’s wells and a decrease in company usage and line loss 

  

operating expenses totaled 2351 million for 2009 compared to 2053 million for 2008 the 298 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of 392 million in dda partially offset by decreases of 164 million in production taxes 14 million in sga and 05 million in loe in addition 2009 includes an 88 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the company’s examination of emerging plays and the impairment charge on an exploratory utica well the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate 263 million and volume 110 million the 025 per mcfe increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the decrease in production taxes was primarily due to a 178 million decrease in severance taxes partially offset by a 14 million increase in property taxes the decrease in severance taxes a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices partially offset by higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the company’s wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes the decrease in sga was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for certain legal disputes partially offset by higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the company increased franchise and gross receipts taxes attributable to increased receipts and costs associated with the amendment of a contract to secure capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water the decrease in loe was primarily attributable to the 2008 program to test the refracturing of existing wells

other income statement items 

  

   

as discussed in note 9 to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company’s availableforsale investments consist of equity and bond funds intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the company selfinsures at december 31 2008 these investments had a fair market value which was 78 million below cost the company analyzed the decline in these investments based on the extent and duration of the impairment and the nature of the underlying assets although the company holds these investments to fund longterm liabilities based on the extent and duration of the impairment combined with then current market conditions the company concluded that the decline was otherthantemporary as such the company recognized a 78 million impairment in earnings in 2008 

  

  

during 2010 the company sold availableforsale securities for 123 million which resulted in gross realized gains of 21 million 14 million of which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income oci 

  

in 2010 2009 and 2008 other income primarily relates to contributions in aid of construction and the equity portion of afudc on various projects the decrease in other income from 2008 to 2009 reflects the completion of the construction of the big sandy pipeline in the second quarter of 2008 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense increased by 164 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to the full year of expense incurred on the 700 million of 8125 notes issued in may 2009 this increase was partially offset by a 44 million increase in capitalized interest primarily due to the capitalization of interest on marcellus shale well development beginning in 2010 reflecting the longer time to flow gas and increased investment associated with the multiwell pads 

  

interest expense increased by 534 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the company’s continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2009 this investment was partially funded by the issuance of 700 million of 8125 notes in may 2009 the interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 28 decrease in the average shortterm interest rate during 2009 

  

weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s longterm debt were 68 65 and 61 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt were 07 07 and 35 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

   

income tax expense increased by 309 million from 2009 to 2010 as a result of higher pretax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate during 2010 the company’s effective income tax rate decreased from 381 to 359 the higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily the result of the impact in 2009 of certain nondeductible expenses and the loss of certain prior year deductions as a result of carrying 2009 losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid these higher rates in 2009 were partially mitigated by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes in 2009 rates were also lower in 2010 due to the reduction of the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation in 2010 

  

income tax expense decreased by 583 million from 2008 to 2009 despite a higher effective tax rate as a result of lower pretax income during 2009 the company’s effective income tax rate increased from 377 to 381 the higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily the result of nondeductible compensation expense partially offset by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes the company recorded a tax benefit in 2008 for a change in the west virginia state tax law that primarily provides for a reduction in future corporate income tax rates which was partially offset by additional tax expense recorded as a result of the completion of the irs audit through the 2005 tax year 

  

  

the company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss position for 2008 2009 and 2010 and expects to pay minimal federal income taxes for the next few years as the company’s drilling program in appalachia continues to generate intangible drilling cost deductions unless tax laws change or the company incurs an unexpected taxable gain from a transaction for federal income tax purposes the company currently deducts approximately 80 of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idc in the year incurred the primary reasons for the company’s net operating loss are the idc deduction resulting from the company’s drilling program and the accelerated tax deprecation for expansion of gathering infrastructure which provide tax deductions in excess of book deductions in addition tax legislation was passed in 2008 2009 and 2010 that allowed companies to deduct 50 of the cost of qualified assets placed in service for those years under the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job create act of 2010 2010 tax relief act companies may deduct 100 of the cost of qualified assets placed in service after september 8 2010 and before january 1 2012

outlook 

  

the company is committed to profitably expanding its production and developing its reserves through costeffective technologicallyadvanced horizontal drilling in its existing plays a substantial portion of the company’s drilling efforts in 2011 are expected to be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in pennsylvania west virginia and kentucky the company expects natural gas sales volume growth of 30 in 2011 gathering transmission and marketed volumes are also expected to increase as the company expands its infrastructure to support its expected growth of produced gas sales specifically in 2011 the company will focus on 

  

·   marcellus shale the marcellus shale is the company’s fastest growing and most profitable play the company expects to access significantly more reserves for less than a proportional amount of development costs through extended lateral drilling and experimenting with new hydraulic fracturing techniques the company also plans to spend 120 million on seismic data to determine optimal placement for future marcellus shale wells 

  

to support the marcellus shale drilling growth the company plans to add 130 mmcfe per day of incremental gathering capacity the company will also strive to optimize its contractual capacity and storage assets which include 350000 dth per day of capacity in tgp’s 300line expansion project which is expected to turn in line late in 2011 

  

also the company expects to continue to invest in its equitrans marcellus expansion project the project is underway and given its significant scope is progressing in stages equitrans placed phase 1 into service on october 1 2010 equitrans filed the certificate application for phase 2 with the ferc on january 27 2011 anticipates obtaining final approval in the summer of 2011 and expects to have phase 2 in service by the end of 2012 over the course of the next two years the equitrans marcellus expansion project will add approximately 550 mmcfe per day of incremental transmission capacity equitrans entered into firm capacity agreements of approximately 530 mmcfe per day with both thirdparties and affiliates in support of the marcellus expansion project 

  

finally to continue the accelerated development of the marcellus shale play the company is also considering partnering with third parties as well as other arrangements including a potential sale of the big sandy pipeline to monetize the value of mature assets to redeploy into highergrowth marcellus shale development 

  

·   huron shale the company plans to continue developing its highly successful horizontal drilling program in the huron shale play where it drills horizontal wells and where possible extends the lateral length as many of the huron wells produce wet gas with significant ngl content and ngls receive higher prices per btu than natural gas the company expects to continue benefiting from the improved economics over an equivalent dry gas well the company has significant midstream capacity in the huron play and is concentrating its drilling near this capacity to further enhance the return on investment

the company has a nonequity interest in a variable interest entity appalachian npi llc anpi in which eqt was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary because eqt does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact anpi’s economic performance thus anpi is not consolidated within the company’s consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2010 anpi had 1438 million of total assets and 861 million of total liabilities including 663 million of longterm debt including current maturities excluding minority interest anpi is financed primarily through cash provided by operating activities 

  

the company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to anpi which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the project’s future cash flows from the preceding yearend until the termination date of the agreement this liquidity reserve guarantee is equal to the fair market value of the assets purchased by anpi the company receives a marketbased fee for the issuance and continuation of the reserve guarantee as of december 31 2010 the maximum amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately 31 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee the terms of the anpi liquidity reserve guarantee require the company to provide a letter of credit in favor of anpi as security for the company’s obligations the amount of this letter of credit requirement at december 31 2010 was approximately 235 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee 

  

the company has entered into an agreement with appalachian natural gas trust angt to provide gathering and operating services to deliver angt’s gas to market in addition the company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered the revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately 156 million 157 million and 159 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s guarantees 

  

rate regulation 

  

the company’s distribution operations transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed as described in notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

the following table details the undiscounted future projected payments associated with the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

  

   

purchase obligations primarily are commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines approximately 170 million and 137 million of these obligations payable in 2011 and 2012 respectively are believed to be recoverable in customer rates 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program the obligations for the company’s various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately 1190 million as of december 31 2010 the company has subleased some of these facilities sublease payments to the company total 324 million and are not netted from the amounts presented in the above table the company has agreements with savanna drilling llc highlands drilling llc patterson helmerich  payne international drilling and other drilling contractors to provide drilling equipment and services to the company these obligations totaled approximately 528 million as of december 31 2010 

  

the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2007 supply longterm incentive program and the 2008 executive performance incentive program see section titled “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations effective 2011 the company adopted the 2011 value driver award program the company may adopt other plans in the future the contractual obligations do not include any payments under the 2011 value driver award program or any potential future plans 

  

as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total liability for the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2010 of 415 million the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above 

  

contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company has established reserves for pending litigation which it believes are adequate and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company 

  

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon eqt’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities under this method all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves   if an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit the depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred the company estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties the estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable those properties would be written down to fair value which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

  

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made unproved properties had a net book value of 4459 million 1059 million and 819 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which can be significantly impacted by management’s expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans should the company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

oil and gas reserves  the company adopted the sec rule modernization of oil and gas reporting as of december 31 2009 proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s 

  

  

engineers and reviewed by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayof themonth price for each month within the 12month period operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans and pension and other post retirement benefits recorded in other comprehensive income loss the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if this step is satisfied then the company must measure the tax position the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit realizable upon ultimate settlement to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed in making this determination the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that an uncertain tax 

  

  

position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement 

  

derivative commodity instruments  the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings see “commodity risk management” above item 7a—“quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding hedging activities 

  

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use as inputs marketbased parameters including but not limited to forward curves discount rates broker quotes volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

a substantial majority of the company’s derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be dedesignated the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings which could materially impact the results of operations one of the requirements for hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged effectiveness may be impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective the company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads credit ratings credit default swap rates and market activity 

  

in addition the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements given the company’s price risk management position and price volatility the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because the company’s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company’s derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of nonperformance risk and by changes in margin requirements 

  

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company increases the carrying amount of 

  

  

the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

share based compensation the company has awarded sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 longterm incentive plans the company treats certain of its executive performance incentive programs including the 2008 executive performance incentive program 2008 epip and the 2007 supply longterm incentive program 2007 supply program as liability awards the actual cost to be recorded for these plans will not be known until the measurement date requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date the company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

  

approximately 70000 units were granted under the 2008 epip the payout of this program will be between zero and three times this number of units valued at the price of the company’s common stock at the end of the performance period december 31 2011 the payout multiple is dependent upon the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group’s total shareholder return and the downward discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors if the company does not attain a specified revenue target as of december 31 2010 265850 awards were outstanding under the 2007 supply program the awards earned were increased to the maximum of three times the initial award based upon achievement of the predetermined production sales revenue and efficiency targets the performance period for the 2007 supply program ended on december 31 2010 

  

assuming no change in the current payout multiple assumptions for 2008 epip a 10 increase in the company’s stock price assumption would have resulted in an increase in 2010 compensation expense under this plan of approximately 02 million 

  

effective january 1 2010 the company adopted the 2010 executive performance incentive program 2010 program and the 2010 stock incentive award 2010 sia program the vesting of the units under the 2010 program will occur upon payment after the end of the 3year performance period the payment will vary between zero and 300 of the number of units granted contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a redefined peer group over the threeyear period ending december 31 2012 and the level of production sales revenues over the period january 1 2010 through september 30 2012 if earned the 2010 program units are expected to be distributed in company common stock the vesting of the awards under the 2010 sia will occur on the third anniversary of the grant date the number of awards granted was contingent upon adjusted 2010 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda performance as compared to plan and individual business unit and company value driver performance over the period january 1 2010 through december 31 2010 as of february 2 2011 there were 302355 awards outstanding under the 2010 sia which are expected to be distributed in company common stock 

  

effective 2011 the company adopted the 2011 volume and efficiency program and the 2011 value driver award program the company may adopt other plans in the future the company has not recorded an obligation under the 2011 volume and efficiency program the 2011 value driver award program or any potential future plans at december 31 2010 

  

  

the 1999 and 2009 longterm incentive plans permit the grant of restricted stock awards and nonqualified stock options to employees of the company for time restricted stock awards compensation expense which is based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the majority of the timebased restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the threeyear period commencing with the date of grant for nonqualified stock options compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s stock expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the company’s shares the volatility of the company’s shares market interest rates and the various performance factors the impact on net income of these changes can be material 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative commodity instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and ngls which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through the eqt production and eqt midstream segments the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k the company uses nonleveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is continually monitored the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

commodity price risk 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels 

  

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company include futures contracts swap agreements collar agreements and option contracts which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity the company also considers other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to ensure an adequate level of return for the well development and infrastructure investment at eqt production and eqt midstream 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2010 the company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2015 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 162 bcf of natural gas see the “commodity risk management” in the “capital resources and liquidity” sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k for further discussion 

  

  

the following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10 increase or a 10 decrease in commodity prices a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2010 levels would increase the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 650 million a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2010 levels would decrease the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 627 million 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheets resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company’s physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore a change to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by the impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the commodity futures trading commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from any potential financial instability of the exchange members the company’s swap collar and option derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole 

  

the company utilizes various processes and analysis to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures this includes closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits to manage the level of credit risk the company enters into transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 69 or 2164 million of otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2010 have a positive fair value as of december 31 2010 all derivative contracts outstanding are with counterparties having an sp rating of a or above at that date 

  

in september 2008 the credit support provider of one counterparty lehman brothers holding inc declared bankruptcy resulting in a default under various derivative contracts with the company as a result those contracts were terminated and a reserve of approximately 5 million was recorded against the entire balance due to the company there is no additional income statement exposure to this counterparty beyond the reserve recorded in 2008 as of december 31 2010 the company was not in default under any derivative contract and has no knowledge of default by any counterparty to a derivative contract the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment 

  

  

included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas to certain marketers including the company’s wholly owned marketing subsidiary eqt energy utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area and a gas processor in kentucky additionally a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt midstream are generated from the gathering of natural gas in kentucky virginia pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that matures on december 8 2014 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 20 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company as of december 31 2010 the company had outstanding under the facility 537 million of loans in support of corporate activities and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of 235 million 

  

no single lender of the 20 financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure if problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry

part iv 

  




 item 1 business   

general 

  

eqt corporation eqt or the company conducts its business through three business segments eqt production eqt midstream and distribution eqt production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the appalachian basin with 41 trillion cubic feet of proved reserves across 34 million acres as of december 31 2009 eqt offers energy products natural gas ngls and a limited amount of crude oil and services to wholesale and retail customers in the united states via eqt midstream and distribution 

  

overall eqt’s increased production increased reserves low cost structure and record results for eqt midstream and distribution operations resulted in an outstanding 2009 some highlights for the year included 

  

▪   sales of produced natural gas of 1001 bcfe a 19 increase over 2008 

  

  

   

production 

  

eqt production has 41 tcfe of proved reserves across three major plays huronberea marcellus and cbm all located in the appalachian basin the company’s strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing its extensive acreage position enabled by a low cost structure eqt production is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program and believes that it is a technological leader in drilling in low pressure shale in particular the use of air in horizontal drilling has proven to be a cost effective technology which the company has efficiently deployed in its huronberea play 

  

the company’s well profile is generally lowrisk wells with long lives low development and production costs high energy content natural gas and close proximity to natural gas markets many of these wells have been producing for decades with several in production since early in the 20 th century 

  

to date eqt has focused its highly successful horizontal air drilling program in the huronberea play where the company has approximately 27 million acres and 28 tcfe of proved reserves this technology has been used in fractured horizontal single lateral wells nonfractured horizontal multilateral wells stacked horizontal wells and extended lateral wells eqt is also employing horizontal drilling technology to its 450000 acres and 11 tcfe of proved reserves in the marcellus play 

  

horizontal wells drilled by the company over the past five years are as follows 

  

   

eqt’s proved reserves increased by 31 in 2009 and by 72 over the past five years while the company’s cost structure remained at an industry leading level eqt’s 2009 3year finding and development costs are among the lowest in the industry at 094 per mcfe with 2009 costs at a low of 068 per mcfe as of december 31 2009 the company’s proved reserves including proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves and the resource plays to which the reserves relate are as follows 

  

  

  the company includes the lower huron cleveland berea sandstone and other devonian shales except marcellus in its huronberea play also included in the huronberea play is 775 bcfe of reserves from nonshale formations accessed through vertical wells 

  

midstream 

  

eqt midstream provides gathering processing transmission and storage services to eqt production and to independent third parties in the appalachian basin the company has approximately 10650 miles of gathering lines and 970 miles of transmission lines eqt also owns and operates kentucky hydrocarbon a gas processing facility in langley kentucky through equitrans lp equitrans eqt’s interstate pipeline affiliate eqt’s transmission and storage system interconnects with five major interstate pipelines texas eastern transmission columbia gas transmission national fuel gas supply tennessee gas pipeline and dominion transmission eqt midstream’s 14 natural gas storage reservoirs provide approximately 500 mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 63 bcf of storage capacity of which 32 bcf is working gas eqt’s storage reservoirs are clustered in two geographic areas with eight in northern west virginia and six in southwestern pennsylvania as of december 31 2009 eqt midstream through equitrans and eqt energy llc eqt energy eqt’s gas marketing affiliate leased an additional 82 bcf of contractual storage capacity and 118834 dth per day of contractual pipeline capacity from third parties in addition in 2008 eqt energy executed a binding precedent agreement with tennessee gas pipeline company tgp a wholly owned subsidiary of el paso corporation for a 15year term that awarded the company capacity in tgp’s 300line expansion project eqt energy’s capacity in the project is expected to be 350000 dth per day giving eqt access to consumer markets from the gulf coast to the midatlantic and the northeast 

  

distribution 

  

eqt’s regulated natural gas distribution subsidiary equitable gas company llc equitable gas eqt’s local distribution affiliate distributes and sells natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania west virginia and eastern kentucky equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania and provides offsystem sales activities which include the purchase and delivery of gas to customers at mutually agreedupon points on facilities not owned by the company 

  

the distribution segment’s business strategy is to earn an appropriate return on its asset base through operational efficiency and innovative regulatory mechanisms distribution is focused on enhancing the value of its existing assets by establishing a reputation for excellent customer service effectively managing capital spending improving the efficiency of its workforce and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations in 2009 equitable gas received approval for a base rate increase in pennsylvania to recover an increased return on assets placed in service since the previous rate case and to fully recover costs associated with customer assistance programs 

  

markets and customers 

  

natural gas sales   eqt production’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers including eqt energy utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area no individual customers accounted for more than 10 of revenues in 2009 or 2007 sales to one marketer accounted for approximately 13 of revenues for eqt production for the year ended december 31 2008 natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas can be volatile as evidenced by the high natural gas prices in early through mid 2008 followed by dramatic decreases later in 2008 and in 2009 the market price for gas located in the appalachian basin is generally higher than the price for gas located in the gulf coast largely due 

  

  

to the differential in the cost to transport gas to customers in the northeastern united states the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to geographically diverse markets 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2009 totaled 161480 bbtu of which approximately 60 related to gathering for eqt production 30 related to third party volumes and 3 related to volumes for other affiliates of the company the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company continued to operate for a fee revenues from affiliates accounted for almost 80 of 2009 gathering revenues 

  

natural gas processing   the company processes natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas ngls are recovered at eqt’s kentucky hydrocarbon facility and transported to a fractionation plant owned by a third party for separation into commercial components the third party markets these components and in exchange retains an agreedupon percentage of ngls delivered by the company the company also has contractual processing arrangements whereby the company sells gas to a third party processor at a weighted average liquids component price 

  

while natural gas processing produces independent revenues the company’s primary reason for these activities is to comply with the product quality specifications of the pipelines on which the company’s produced natural gas is transported and sold as a result the company typically engages in gas processing at locations where its produced gas would not satisfy the downstream interstate pipeline’s gas quality specifications without sufficient processing the company’s natural gas production could be interrupted as a result of an inability to achieve required interstate pipeline specifications thus as the company’s production continues to grow access to gas processing capacity must also grow 

  

natural gas transmission and storage services offered by eqt energy include commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services these operations are executed using company owned and operated or contracted transmission and underground storage facilities as well as other contractual capacity arrangements with major pipeline and storage service providers in the eastern united states eqt energy uses leased storage capacity and firm transportation capacity including the company’s big sandy pipeline capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities eqt energy also engages in risk management and energy trading activities for the company the objective of these activities is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets 

  

customers of eqt midstream’s gas transportation storage risk management and related services are affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and ugi energy services inc eqt energy’s commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services are offered to natural gas producers and energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers 

  

equitrans’ firm transportation contracts expire between 2010 and 2018 the company anticipates that the capacity associated with these expiring contracts will be remarketed or used by affiliates such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed in 2009 approximately 80 of transportation volumes and approximately 87 of transportation revenues were from affiliates 

  

natural gas distribution the company’s distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 275900 customers consisting of 257300 residential customers and 18600 commercial and 

  

  

industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia these service areas have a rather static population and economy 

  

equitable gas purchases gas through contracts with various sources including major and independent producers in the gulf coast local producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate the gas purchase contracts contain various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 74 of calendar year 2009 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during the offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

  

competition 

  

natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include major oil and gas companies other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators key competitors for new gathering and processing systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies natural gas marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers the company’s distribution operations face competition from other local distribution companies alternative fuels and reduced usage among customers as a result of conservation 

  

regulation 

  

eqt production’s natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells drilling stimulating and casing of wells water withdrawal and disbursement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and taxes the plugging and abandoning of wells and the gathering of production in certain circumstances these regulations may increase the costs of drilling 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties eqt production’s operating states allow in certain circumstances the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration while in other circumstances it is necessary to rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop natural gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of natural gas we produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we drill 

  

eqt midstream has both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated activities consist of federallyregulated transmission and storage operations and certain stateregulated gathering operations the nonregulated activities include certain gathering and transportation operations processing of ngls and risk management activities equitrans’ rates and operations are subject to regulation by the ferc the 2006 ferc rate case settlement allowed equitrans among other things to institute an annual surcharge for the tracking and recovery of all costs operations maintenance and return on invested capital incurred on and after september 1 2005 related to equitrans’ pipeline safety program under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 the company has continued to utilize the surcharge mechanism each year to recover costs incurred in connection with its pipeline safety program under the terms of the 2006 settlement equitrans was prohibited from seeking new base 

  

  

transmission and storage rates prior to june 1 2009 and is prohibited from seeking new gathering base rates prior to november 1 2010 in 2008 the big sandy pipeline was placed in service in eastern kentucky 

  

equitable gas’ distribution rates terms of service and contracts with affiliates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the wv psc in addition the issuance of securities by equitable gas is subject to regulation by the pa puc  the field line sales rates in kentucky are subject to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission 

  

equitable gas must usually seek the approval of one or more of its regulators prior to changing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and transportation activities equitable gas is allowed to recover a return in addition to the costs of its distribution and gathering delivery activities however equitable gas’ regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term on february 26 2009 the pa puc approved a settlement between equitable gas and the active parties to the filing for a base rate case increase in pennsylvania the company implemented the new base rates upon approval of the settlement on october 29 2009 equitable gas filed a request with the wv psc to increase the rates it charges its customers for delivery of natural gas in west virginia it is the first delivery rate increase that equitable gas has requested in west virginia since 1991 the rate case proceedings are expected to be resolved no later than the third quarter of 2010   

  

pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers equitable gas has several such programs including the customer assistance program cap effective with the approval of the pennsylvania rate case settlement the company received approval to implement an increased cap surcharge for recovery of its costs for assisting lowincome customers with paying their gas bills and will receive an annual reconciliation of cap costs to ensure complete recovery of these costs   

  

equitable gas continues to work with regulators to implement alternative cost recovery programs equitable gas’ tariffs for commercial and industrial customers allow for negotiated rates in limited circumstances 

  

regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company is not aware of any significant noncompliance as a result of any completed audits 

  

employees 

  

the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1800 employees at the end of 2009 

  

holding company reorganization 

  

on june 30 2008 the former equitable resources inc old eqt entered into and completed an agreement and plan of merger the plan under which old eqt reorganized into a holding company structure such that a newly formed pennsylvania corporation also named equitable resources inc new eqt became the publicly traded holding company of old eqt and its subsidiaries the primary purpose of this reorganization the reorganization was to separate old eqt’s stateregulated distribution operations into a new subsidiary in order to better segregate its regulated and unregulated businesses and improve overall financing flexibility to effect the reorganization old eqt formed new eqt a whollyowned subsidiary and new eqt in turn formed egc merger co a pennsylvania corporation owned solely by new eqt mergersub under the plan mergersub merged with and into old eqt with old eqt surviving the merger the merger resulted in old eqt becoming a direct whollyowned subsidiary of new eqt new eqt changed its name to eqt corporation effective february 9 2009 throughout this annual report references to eqt eqt corporation and the company refer collectively to new eqt and its consolidated subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors   

risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the proximity to and availability of capacity on transportation facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

  

lower natural gas prices may result in decreases in the revenue margin and cash flow for each of our businesses a reduction in the construction of new transportation capacity and downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves which may cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings a reduction in cash flow will reduce our funds available for capital expenditures and correspondingly our opportunities for growth we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value 

  

increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap collar and option agreements and exchange traded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

our operations are regulated extensively at the federal state and local levels laws regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan design drill install operate and abandon wells gathering systems pipelines and distribution systems environment health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety compliance with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses may be costly these requirements could subject us to liability for personal injuries property damage and other damages our failure to comply with the laws regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our businesses even if as a result of factors beyond our control may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties and damages   

  

  

the rates charged to customers by our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are in many cases subject to state or federal regulation the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates 

  

laws regulations and other legal requirements are constantly changing and implementation of compliant processes in response to such changes could be costly and time consuming for instance t he us congress and various states have been evaluating climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning natural gas such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to or taxes on and the release capture and use of greenhouse gases that could have an adverse effect on our operations changes to well fracturing or waste water regulations or existing legal requirements could also have a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business such as the imposition of a new severance tax a tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce gas could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability  

  

strategic determinations regarding the allocation of capital and other resources in the current economic environment are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our businesses may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

  

in developing our 2010 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity midstream infrastructure distribution infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2010 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we don’t optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected 

  

global financial challenges may adversely affect our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict downgrades to our credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing adversely affecting our business results of operations and liquidity 

  

we rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition and we may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions the economic situation could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables market conditions could cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection continuing challenges in the economy could lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings 

  

any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity we cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish financial results 

  

  

our failure to develop or obtain and maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations   

  

our delivery of gas depends upon the availability of adequate transportation infrastructure the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as processing adjacent to and curtailments on such pipelines  the lack of midstream infrastructure is particularly acute in the geographic area in which the marcellus shale is being developed our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors we also deliver to and are served by third party gas gathering transportation processing and storage facilities which are limited in number and geographically concentrated an extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities could result in adverse consequences to us in addition some of our third party contracts may involve significant financial commitments on our part and may make us dependent upon others to get our produced natural gas to market 

  

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation storage and distribution of natural gas these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage as a result we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks 

  

the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the gas to market successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect our recent addition of exploration projects increases the risks inherent in our natural gas activities specifically seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our operations because we have a limited operating history in certain exploratory areas our 

  

  

future operating results are difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

eqt production   eqt production’s properties are located primarily in kentucky west virginia virginia and pennsylvania this segment currently has approximately 34 million gross acres approximately 67 of which are considered undeveloped which encompasses nearly all of the company’s acreage of proved developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil production properties although most of its wells are drilled to relatively shallow depths 2000 to 6500 feet below the surface the company retains what are normally considered “deep rights” on the majority of its acreage as of december 31 2009 the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 4068 bcfe consisting of proved developed producing reserves of 1912 bcfe proved developed nonproducing reserves of 161 bcfe and proved undeveloped reserves of 1995 bcfe all of the company’s reserves reside in continuous accumulations the company’s estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves are prepared by company engineers the engineer primarily responsible for the technical aspects of the reserves audit has received a bachelors degree in engineering from the pennsylvania state university and has ten years of experience in the oil and gas industry   to ensure that the reserves are materially accurate management reviews the price heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves additionally production volumes are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accountingmeasurement systems and the reserve roll forward between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management the estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves are audited by the independent consulting firm of ryder scott company lp who is hired by the company’s management since 1937 ryder scott company lp has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the united states and internationally   ryder scott company lp’s audit report has been filed herewith as exhibit 9901 no report has been filed with any federal authority or agency reflecting a 5 or more difference from the company’s estimated total reserves additional information relating to the company’s estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows is provided in note 22 unaudited to the consolidated financial statements 

  

natural gas and crude oil production 

  

   

  

average per unit production cost including severance taxes of natural gas and crude oil during 2009 2008 and 2007 was 0585 0871 and 0740 per mcfe respectively 

  

   

   

certain lease acquisition agreements require the company to drill 2 marcellus or deeper wells and 6 wells drilled to 250’ above the top of the tully formation or deeper in 2010 5 wells drilled to 250’ above the top of the tully formation or deeper plus 4 wells to any depth or formation in 2011 and 5 wells drilled to 250’ above the top of the tully formation or deeper plus 2 wells to any depth or formation in 2012 each of these wells must be drilled within specified acreage the company intends to satisfy these requirements as part of its marcellus development program as of december 31 2009 leases associated with 9975 gross undeveloped acres expire in 2010 if they are not renewed however the company has an active lease renewal program 

  

number of net productive and dry exploratory and development wells drilled 

  

   

  

selected data by state at december 31 2009 unless otherwise noted 

  

   

during 2009 the company converted 65 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves and 315 bcfe of nonproved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves the company anticipates spending 29 billion to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves over the next 5 years capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled 717 million during 2009 proved reserves increased primarily in the marcellus and huronberea plays as a result of the company’s 2009 drilling program in addition the application of new sec oil and gas reporting rules permitted the booking of puds in locations more than one offset location away from existing wells partially offsetting these reserve additions eqt also reported a reduction of cbmother reserves as a result of removing previously booked vertical locations 

  

the company’s 2009 extensions discoveries and other additions resulting from extensions of the proved acreage of previously discovered reservoirs through additional drilling in periods subsequent to discovery of 1159 bcfe exceeded the 2009 production of 1049 bcfe of this increase approximately 715 bcfe was attributable to drilling in 2009 that would have qualified as reserve extensions discoveries and other additions under the previous 

  

  

rules including approximately 400 bcfe related to offset locations from wells drilled in 2009 the remaining additions are attributable to the sec’s expanded definition of proved reserves to include reserves based on reasonable certainty partially offset by removing reserves that were previously recorded for future vertical wells 

  

during 2009 the company recorded downward revisions of 948 bcfe to the december 31 2008 estimate of proved reserves due to decreased prices and other revisions the new sec oil and gas reporting rules modified the definition of proved reserves as well as the price used in the calculation which resulted in approximately 55 bcfe of revision of previous estimates the reserves were computed using unweighted arithmetic averages of the closing prices on the first day of each month during 2009 absent the effect of the new sec oil and gas reporting rule the price impact would have been minimal as prices as of december 31 2009 only decreased approximately 006 from december 31 2008 

  

wells located in kentucky are primarily in shale formations with depths ranging from 2500 feet to 6000 feet and average spacing of 100 acres wells located in west virginia are primarily in tight sands and shale formations with depths ranging from 2500 feet to 6500 feet and average spacing of 40 acres in the northern part of the state and 60 acres in the southern part of the state horizontal wells in both northern and southern west virginia are drilled on 100 acre spacing wells located in virginia are primarily in coalbed methane formations with depths ranging from 2000 feet to 3000 feet and average spacing of 60 acres and in tight sands and shale formations at depths of 3000 to 6500 feet on 100 acre spacing wells located in pennsylvania are primarily in shale formations with depths ranging from 7000 feet to 8000 feet and average spacing of 100 acres 

  

during 2008 the company drilled its first exploratory vertical utica well during 2009 the company made the decision to plug back the well and to convert the well to a horizontal marcellus well in 2010 as a result the company wroteoff 29 million of incremental exploratory costs related to drilling down to the utica formation as of december 31 2009 50 million of well costs remain capitalized for the future horizontal marcellus well pending successful completion

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

in 2009 eqt achieved record results highlights for 2009 included 

  

·   record annual sales of produced natural gas of 1001 bcfe more than 19  higher than 2008 

·   drilled 800 th horizontal huronberea well approximately 27 of sales were from horizontal huronberea wells 

·   drilled 46 horizontal marcellus wells 

·   record eqt midstream throughput and operating income and 

·   record distribution operating income of 789 million 32 higher than 2008 

  

eqt’s consolidated income from continuing operations for 2009 was 1569 million 119 per diluted share compared with 2556 million 200 per diluted share for 2008 and 2575 million 210 per diluted share for 2007 

  

the 987 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a lower average wellhead sales price increased incentive compensation expense increased depletion expense and higher interest expense partially offset by increased gas sales volumes at eqt production increased gathering volumes and rate big sandy pipeline activity and ngls sold at eqt midstream and an increase in base rates in the distribution segment 

  

incentive compensation expense increased from 2008 to 2009 as a result of expenses related to the company’s 2009 shareholder value plan recorded in 2009 and a reversal of previously recorded expense on the company’s 2005 executive performance incentive program in 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in the company’s stock price in 2008 incentive compensation is primarily reported in selling general and administrative expenses in the statements of consolidated income a significant portion of the 2009 expense and 2008 reversal are reported as unallocated expenses in the information by business segment in note 2 of the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

  

interest expense increased from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the company’s continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2009 this investment was partially funded by the issuance of 700 million of 8125 notes in may 2009 

  

the 19 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2007 to 2008 reflects an increase in operating income of 1531 million which was more than offset by the absence of a 2007 pretax gain of 1261 million on the sale of assets in the nora area higher 2008 interest and income taxes and a 2008 other than temporary impairment loss on available for sale securities   

  

operating income for 2008 was impacted by decreased incentive compensation expense increased production revenues due to higher average wellhead sales prices and significantly higher volumes increased gathering and transmission revenues due to higher rates and volumes and the absence of 2007 transaction costs associated with the terminated peoples and hope acquisition the decreased incentive compensation expense was the result of the reversal of previously recorded expense on the company’s 2005 executive performance incentive program partially offset by increased shortterm incentive compensation these items were partially offset by increased depletion depreciation and amortization increased operating and administrative expenses and the impact of the may 2007 asset sales 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive expenses income and administrative expenses totaling 622 million 174 million and 653 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively were not allocated to business segments the unallocated expense in 2009 and 2007 primarily relates to performancerelated incentive expenses while the unallocated income in 2008 primarily relates to the reversal of previously recorded performancerelated incentive expenses 

  

the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the company’s consolidated operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income totals in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements additionally these subtotals are reconciled to the company’s consolidated net income in note 2 the company has also reported the components of each segment’s operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived eqt’s management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition operations and trends of each of eqt’s segments without being obscured by these items for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes 

  

eqt production 

  

overview 

  

driven by aggressive horizontal air drilling in the huronberea play eqt production achieved sales of produced natural gas of 1001 bcfe in 2009 representing a more than 19 increase also unit loe excluding production taxes decreased 14 in 2009 to 030 per mcfe 

  

eqt production’s strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing the company’s extensive acreage position through organic growth enabled by a low cost structure the company is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program and believes that it is a technological leader in drilling in low pressure shale in particular the use of air in horizontal drilling has proven to be a cost effective technology which the company has efficiently deployed to various geological formations in the 

  

  

appalachian basin mountain terrain and which may be deployed to other company assets in the appalachian basin to maximize production in 2009 extended laterals utilizing this technology produced a 6700 foot lateral with 6000 feet of pay essentially doubling the typical horizontal well which is a 3700 foot with 3000 feet of pay based on these favorable preliminary results the company is in the process of incorporating extended lateral wells into its preferred standard operating procedures for the huronberea play the company expects to access significantly more reserves through the extended lateral drilling procedures for less than a proportional amount of the development costs 

  

in 2009 the company drilled 434 gross wells in the huronberea play total proved reserves in the huronberea play including vertical nonshale formations are 28 tcfe in the marcellus play the company drilled 50 gross wells during 2009 total proved reserves in the marcellus play increased 1278 to 11 tcfe proved reserves increased in the marcellus and huronberea plays as a result of the company’s 2009 drilling program in addition the application of new sec oil and gas reporting rules permitted the booking of puds in locations more than one offset location away from existing wells the company drilled 218 gross cbm wells in 2009 the cbm play had total proved reserves of 02 tcfe at december 31 2009 down 6 from 2008 as a result of the implementation of the new sec oil and gas reporting rules see item 2 “properties” for additional discussion of the company’s proved reserves and the impact of the new sec oil and gas reporting rules sales of produced natural gas in 2009 from the huronberea marcellus and cbm plays were 849 bcfe 29 bcfe and 123 bcfe respectively 

  

eqt production’s revenues for 2009 decreased approximately 16 compared to 2008 revenues the average wellhead sales price decreased approximately 30 as a result of decreased commodity market prices offset by slightly higher hedge prices yearoveryear gas sales volumes increased more than 19 from 2008 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2008 and 2009 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells 

  

operating expenses at eqt production included an 88 million increase in the company’s exploration program the increase in exploration expense is primarily a result of the company’s initiative to explore additional reserve opportunities in various exploration plays on its legacy acreage position with the purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties in addition in 2009 eqt production recorded a 29 million impairment charge associated with the writeoff of the utica exploratory well when the company made the decision to abandon the utica formation and plug back the well to the marcellus formation excluding exploration expenses 2009 operating expenses increased 10 primarily due to higher depletion resulting from increased drilling investments

c   capital expenditures in 2009 and 2008 include 310 million and 855 million respectively for undeveloped property acquisitions capital expenditures in 2007 include 244 million for the acquisition of working interests in wells in the roaring fork area 

  

d   production taxes include severance and productionrelated ad valorem and other property taxes 

  

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2009 vs december 31 2008 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 1511 million for 2009 compared to 2528 million for 2008 a decrease of 1017 million between years primarily due to a lower average wellhead sales price and an increase in depletion expenses partially offset by increased gas sales volumes 

  

total operating revenues were 3846 million for 2009 compared to 4571 million for 2008 the decrease in operating revenues was due to lower realized prices which more than offset increased sales volumes the average wellhead sales price decreased by 157 per mcfe primarily as a result of a decrease in nymex natural gas prices and a lower percentage of hedged gas sales partially offset by a higher realized hedge price the decrease in prices was partially offset by increased sales volumes of more than 19 as a result of the 2008 and 2009 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the company’s wells and a decrease in company usage and line loss 

  

operating expenses totaled 2335 million for 2009 compared to 2044 million for 2008 the 291 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of 392 million in dda partially offset by decreases of 170 million in production taxes 14 million in sga and 05 million in loe in addition 2009 includes an 88 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the company’s examination of emerging plays and the impairment charge on the exploratory utica well the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate 263 million and volume 110 million the 025 per mcfe increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the decrease in production taxes was primarily due to an 184 million decrease in severance taxes partially offset by a 14 million increase in property taxes the decrease in severance taxes a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices partially offset by higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the company’s wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes the decrease in sga was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for certain legal disputes partially offset by higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the company increased franchise and gross receipts taxes attributable to increased receipts and costs associated with the amendment of a contract to secure capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water the decrease in loe was primarily attributable to the 2008 program to test the refracturing of existing wells 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2008 vs december 31 2007 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 2528 million for 2008 compared to 3312 million for 2007 a decrease of 784 million between years primarily due to the absence of a 2007 gain on the sale of a portion of the company’s interests in certain gas properties in the nora area compared to 2008 results which included higher average wellhead sales price and increased gas sales volumes partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

  

total operating revenues were 4571 million for 2008 compared to 3644 million for 2007 the 927 million increase in operating revenues was due to higher realized prices and increased sales volumes the average wellhead sales price increased by 073 per mcfe primarily as a result of an increase in nymex natural gas prices and a higher percentage of unhedged gas sales partially offset by a lower realized hedge price additionally sales volumes increased 12 excluding the 2007 sale of interests which provided sales of 1966 mmcfe during 2007 as a result of the 2008 and 2007 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the company’s wells 

  

operating expenses totaled 2044 million for 2008 compared to 1624 million for 2007 the 420 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of 162 million in dda 110 million in production taxes 64 million in loe and 02 million in sga in addition the 2008 period included an 82 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the company’s examination of emerging plays the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate 99 million and volume 50 million the 011 increase in the depletion rate was primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the increase in production taxes was primarily due to a 98 million increase in severance taxes and a 12 million increase in property taxes the increase in severance taxes a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted was 

  

  

primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the company’s wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes the increase in loe was attributable to personnel costs the 2008 program to test the refracturing of existing wells salt water and waste disposal environmental costs and road and location maintenance the increase in sga was primarily due to higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the company partially offset by lower charges for certain legal disputes in 2008 compared to 2007 

  

on april 13 2007 the company and range resources corporation range agreed to a development plan for the nora area in southwestern virginia the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement purchase agreement with pine mountain oil and gas inc pmog a subsidiary of range pursuant to which the company agreed to sell to pmog a portion of the company’s interests in certain gas properties in the nora area as a result of this transaction eqt production recognized a net gain of 1292 million in earnings in 2007 the net gain includes a gain on the sale of working interest in oil and gas properties under the purchase agreement of 1576 million offset by a hedge loss of 284 million resulting from a 73 bcf reduction in the company’s hedge position due to the sale of properties see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to this transaction 

  

outlook 

  

eqt production’s business strategy is focused on organic growth of the company’s natural gas reserves and sales volumes key elements of eqt production’s strategy include 

  

·   expanding production and developed reserves through horizontal drilling in kentucky west virginia and pennsylvania the company is committed to expanding its production and developed reserves through horizontal drilling in its existing plays the company will seek to maximize the value of its existing asset base by developing its large acreage position which the company believes holds significant production and reserve growth potential a substantial portion of t he company’s 2010 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in kentucky west virginia and pennsylvania additionally based on favorable preliminary results the company is in the process of incorporating extended lateral wells into its preferred standard operating procedures for the huronberea play the company expects to access significantly more reserves through the extended lateral drilling procedures for less than a proportional amount of the development costs sales of produced natural gas in 2010 are projected to be 20 higher than the 2009 produced gas sales 

  

·   maintaining flexibility in a low price environment  the pace at which the company is able to grow production and reserves is impacted by drilling success and the price for natural gas the company has mitigated some of the commodity price risk by hedging a portion of its production the company believes that its position as a low cost operator allows for the development of reserves and production in a low price environment 

  

·   geological and geophysical expenditures – in 2010 the company plans to spend 105 million on seismic data to determine optimal placement for future marcellus wells and 15 million on 2d and 3d seismic data over properties in which the company holds deeper exploration and drilling rights 

  

·   growing acreage position – the company is focused on expanding production primarily through organic development of its large acreage position the company may also take advantage of property acquisition opportunities as economic conditions warrant 

  

  

eqt midstream 

  

overview 

  

in 2009 eqt midstream achieved record throughput and operating income primarily due to revenues generated by new infrastructure projects exceeding the increased costs required to operate these assets projects completed in 2008 that positively impacted 2009 earnings include the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant and gas compression facilities kentucky hydrocarbon which have the capacity to process 170 mmcfe of natural gas per day the mayking corridor project mayking which consists of three compressor units and 38 miles of pipe and the big sandy pipeline which currently provides 130000 dth per day of firm transportation capacity in 2009 eqt midstream continued optimizing existing capacity by building gathering lines to tie in wells in kentucky west virginia and pennsylvania the combination of these 2009 investments with the kentucky hydrocarbon mayking and the big sandy pipeline provided the platform for sales growth and will help to mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the company’s gathering systems in transporting gas to market 

  

eqt midstream’s net operating revenues increased by 27 from 2008 to 2009 this increase was primarily due to increases in gathered volumes due to our infrastructure expansion increased processing volumes as a result of the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant being operational for a full year in 2009 and transmission revenues from the big sandy pipeline   increases in net operating revenues were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

  

eqt energy the company’s gas marketing affiliate executed a binding precedent agreement with tennessee gas pipeline company tgp a wholly owned subsidiary of el paso corporation for a 15year term that awarded the company 300000 dth per day of capacity in tgp’s 300line expansion project in july 2009 the parties amended the binding precedent agreement and eqt energy’s capacity in the project was increased to 350000 dth per day beginning in november 2011 the awarded capacity will provide eqt access to consumer markets from the gulf coast to the midatlantic and the northeast

eqt midstream’s operating income totaled 1890 million for 2009 compared to 1348 million for 2008 the 542 million increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased gathering and processing volumes gathering rates and increased big sandy pipeline activity partially offset by increases in om and da expense 

  

total net operating revenues were 3862 million for 2009 compared to 3033 million for 2008 the 829 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a 254 million increase in gathering net operating revenues a 222 million increase in processing net operating revenues a 252 million increase in transmission net operating revenues and a 101 million increase in storage marketing and other net operating revenues 

  

gathering net operating revenues increased due to an 11 increase in gathered volumes as well as a 6 increase in the average gathering fee this increase was driven by more volumes gathered for eqt production as well as increased third party customer volume due to increased available capacity with mayking and the big sandy pipeline being operational for a full year in 2009 processing net revenues increased primarily due to a 55 increase in ngls sold this resulted from increased production volumes from both eqt production and third party customers and the expansion of the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant and gas compression facilities in the second half of 2008 although the average ngl sales price decreased more than 35 from 2008 the impact on processing net operating revenues was not significant due to a decrease in the related cost of natural gas processed 

  

transmission net revenues in 2009 increased from the prior year primarily due to increased capacity from the big sandy pipeline which came online in the second quarter of 2008 the increase in storage and marketing net revenues was primarily due to increased third party marketing that utilized big sandy pipeline capacity 

  

total operating revenues decreased by 1379 million or 20 primarily as a result of lower sales prices on decreased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets and lower ngl sales prices partially offset by an increase in gathering and processing volumes gathering rates and increased transmission revenues from the big sandy pipeline total purchased gas costs decreased 58 as a result of lower gas costs on 

  

  

decreased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets and lower gas costs related to processing activities 

  

operating expenses totaled 1972 million for 2009 compared to 1686 million for 2008 the increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 122 million in om and 185 million in da offset by a decrease of 21 million in sga the increase in om resulted mainly from higher electricity labor nonincome taxes and compressor maintenance expenses for the gathering and processing business due to new compressors and processing facilities put in operation in the second half of 2008 partially offset by a decrease of 95 million relating to pension and other postretirement benefit charges recorded in 2008 the increase in da was primarily due to the increased investment in infrastructure during 2008 and 2009 the decrease in sga was primarily due to expenses in 2008 which were not incurred in 2009 including a 52 million reserve against lehman brothers receivables and 12 million for legal and actuarial services associated with the pension and other postretirement benefit charges partially offset by an increase in labor and services to support the growth in the midstream business during 2009 

  

other income represents allowance for equity funds used during construction the 43 million decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily caused by afudc recorded on the construction of the big sandy pipeline in 2008 afudc was no longer recorded once big sandy was placed into service in the second quarter of 2008 

  

equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled 64 million for 2009 compared to 51 million for 2008 this increase is related to equity earnings recorded for eqt midstream’s investment in nora gathering llc which was formed in may 2007 earnings increased in 2009 as a result of higher net income for nora gathering llc in 2009 compared to 2008 the higher net income was driven by increases in the average gathering fee and gathered volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses for the nora operations in 2009

other income represents allowance for equity funds used during construction the 16 million decrease from 2007 to 2008 was primarily caused by a full year of afudc on big sandy recorded in 2007 as compared to only a partial year in 2008 as big sandy was placed online in the second quarter of 2008 

  

equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled 51 million for 2008 compared to 26 million for 2007 this increase is related to equity earnings recorded for eqt midstream’s investment in nora gathering llc which was formed in may 2007

equitable distribution 

  

overview 

  

distribution’s business strategy is to earn a competitive return on its asset base through operational efficiency and innovative regulatory mechanisms distribution is focused on enhancing the value of its existing assets by establishing a reputation for excellent customer service effectively managing its capital spending improving the efficiency of its workforce and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations 

  

equitable gas continues to focus on improved customer service in 2009 equitable gas launched a new website giving customers the ability to view and pay bills online and providing customers with a home energy analyzer that enables them to easily examine their energy use factoring in weather appliance and electronics usage and the type of construction used in their home these and other efforts including improved operating performance at equitable gas’s customer call center have resulted in increased overall customer satisfaction 

  

on february 26 2009 the pa puc approved a settlement between equitable gas and the active parties to the filing for a base rate case increase in pennsylvania the company implemented the new base rates upon approval of the settlement 

  

pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers equitable gas has several such programs including the customer assistance program cap as part of the rate case settlement the company received approval to increase the cap surcharge in order to recover its costs for assisting lowincome customers with paying their gas bills in addition the cap costs will be reconciled annually to ensure complete recovery of these costs in the future 

  

distribution’s net operating revenues increased 5 from 2008 to 2009 due to the increase in base rates the weather in equitable gas’ service territory in 2009 was 3 warmer than 2008 and 6 warmer than the 30year national oceanic and atmospheric administration average the weather in 2008 was 4 warmer than the 30year average total operating expenses decreased 9 from 2008  primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower overhead costs in 2009

in 2007 the company reviewed its investment portfolio including its investment allocation and sold equity funds with a cost basis of 63 million for total proceeds of 73 million resulting in the company recognizing a gain of 10 million 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense increased by 534 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to the company’s continued investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2009 this investment was partially funded by the issuance of 700 million of 8125 notes in may 2009 the interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 28 decrease in the average shortterm interest rate during 2009 

  

interest expense increased by 107 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the company’s investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2007 and 2008 this investment was partially funded by the issuance of 500 million of 65 notes in march 2008 the interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 23 decrease in the average shortterm interest rate during 2008 

  

weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s longterm debt were 65 61 and 59 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt were 07 35 and 58 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

  

income taxes 

  

   

income tax expense decreased by 583 million from 2008 to 2009 despite a higher effective tax rate as a result of lower pretax income during 2009 the company’s effective income tax rate increased from 377 to 381 the higher tax rate in 2009 is primarily the result of nondeductible compensation expense partially offset by a regulatory asset recorded to recover deferred taxes caused by an accounting method change that deducts as repairs certain costs capitalized for financial accounting purposes the company recorded a tax benefit in 2008 for a change in the west virginia state tax law that primarily provides for a reduction in future corporate income tax rates which was partially offset by additional tax expense recorded as a result of the completion of the irs audit through the 2005 tax year 

  

income tax expense increased by 105 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the increase in the company’s effective tax rate the effective tax rate for 2008 was 377 compared to 359 in 2007 the higher effective tax rate in 2008 is the result of several factors including the company being in a net operating loss position for tax purposes in 2008 which resulted in the loss of certain deductions for 2008 and for prior years as a result of carrying losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid in addition state taxes increased as a result of limitations imposed on certain state tax losses generated in 2008 the company recorded a net increase to tax expense in 2008 as a result of the completion of its irs audit through the 2005 tax year partially offset by a beneficial change in the west virginia state tax law 

  

the company was in an overall federal tax net operating loss position for 2008 and 2009 and expects to pay minimal federal income taxes for as long as the company’s drilling program in appalachia continues unless tax laws change for federal income tax purposes the company currently deducts approximately 75 of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idc in the year incurred the primary reasons for the company’s net operating loss are the idc deduction resulting from the company’s drilling program and the accelerated tax deprecation for expansion of gathering infrastructure which provide tax deductions in excess of book deductions 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

overview 

  

the company’s primary sources of cash during 2009 were cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from a public offering of senior notes the company used the proceeds from the public offering primarily to fund its capital spending program and repay shortterm borrowings

cash flows provided by operating activities increased to 5092 million in 2008 from 4267 million in 2007 the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a net cash refund related to income taxes of 140 million in 2008 compared to a net cash payment of 634 million in 2007 for federal income tax purposes the company currently deducts approximately 75 of drilling costs as intangible drilling costs idc in the year incurred the idc deduction resulting from its drilling program coupled with accelerated tax depreciation for expansion of the gathering infrastructure put the company into an overall federal tax net operating 

  

  

loss position in 2008 unless the idc related tax law changes this tax position is likely to continue so long as the company’s drilling program in appalachia continues as such the company expects minimal federal cash taxes for the foreseeable future

shortterm borrowings 

  

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices in addition to funding working capital requirements which are significantly impacted by seasonality the company utilizes shortterm borrowings to fund any required margin deposit until the underlying transactions are settled or the deposits are returned and to finance capital expenditures until they can be permanently financed 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that matures on october 26 2011 the facility may be used for working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and other purposes including support of a commercial paper program the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company lehman brothers bank fsb lehman is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding 95 million under the facility lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to 1405 million otherwise the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic operations in december 2005 the company agreed to maintain in place guarantees of certain warranty obligations of noresco the savings guarantees provided that once the energyefficiency construction was completed by noresco the customer would experience a certain dollar amount of energy savings over a period of years   the undiscounted maximum aggregate payments that may be due related to these guarantees is approximately 274 million as of december 31 2009 extending at a decreasing amount for approximately 20 years in addition the company agreed to maintain in place certain outstanding payment and performance bonds letters of credit and other guarantee obligations supporting noresco’s obligations under certain customer contracts existing leases and other items with an undiscounted maximum exposure to the company as of december 31 2009 of approximately 42 million of which approximately 34 million relates to work already completed under the associated contracts in addition approximately 35 million of these guarantee obligations will end or be terminated not later than december 31 2010 

  

in exchange for the company’s agreement to maintain these guarantee obligations the purchaser of the noresco business and noresco agreed among other things that noresco would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and agreed to reimburse the company for any loss under the guarantee obligations provided that the purchaser’s reimbursement obligation will not exceed 6 million in the aggregate and will expire on november 18 2014 in 2008 the original purchaser of noresco sold its interest in noresco and transferred its obligations to a third party in connection with that event the new owner delivered to the company a 1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations 

  

the noresco guarantees are exempt from fasb asc topic 460 guarantees the company has determined that the likelihood it will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and any potential 

  

  

payments are expected to be immaterial to the company’s financial position results of operations and liquidity as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

  

in november 1995 eqt through a subsidiary guaranteed a tax indemnification to the limited partners of appalachian basin partners lp abp for any tax losses resulting from a disallowance of the nonconventional fuels tax credits if certain representations and warranties of the company were not true the company guaranteed the tax indemnification until the tax statute of limitations closes the company does not have any recourse provisions with third parties or any collateral held by third parties associated with this guarantee that could be liquidated to recover amounts paid if any under the guarantee as of december 31 2009 the maximum amount of future payments the company could be required to make is estimated to be approximately 12 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee and has not modified it subsequent to issuance additionally based on the status of the company’s irs examinations the company has determined that any potential loss from this guarantee is remote 

  

the company has a nonequity interest in a variable interest entity appalachian npi llc anpi in which eqt was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary thus anpi is not consolidated within the company’s consolidated financial statements in determining the primary beneficiary the company estimated the expected losses and expected residual returns of anpi under various scenarios in order to identify the party that would absorb the majority of the losses or benefit from the majority of the returns the primary assumptions utilized in the scenarios included commodity price and production volumes in june 2009 the fasb issued amendments to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities the amendments are effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period after november 15 2009 the company determined that these amendments will not have a material impact on the company’s future consolidated financial statements   as of december 31 2009 anpi had 154 million of total assets and 144 million of total liabilities including 85 million of longterm debt including current maturities excluding minority interest anpi is financed primarily through cash provided by operating activities 

  

the company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to anpi which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the project’s future cash flows from the preceding yearend until the termination date of the agreement this liquidity reserve guarantee is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the appalachian natural gas trust angt the company receives a marketbased fee for the issuance and continuation of the reserve guarantee as of december 31 2009 the maximum amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately 30 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee the terms of the anpi liquidity reserve guarantee require the company to provide a letter of credit in favor of anpi as security for the company’s obligations the amount of this letter of credit requirement at december 31 2009 was approximately 244 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee 

  

the company has entered into an agreement with angt to provide gathering and operating services to deliver angt’s gas to market in addition the company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered the revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately 157 million 159 million and 158 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s guarantees 

  

pension plans 

  

total pension expense recognized by the company in 2009 2008 and 2007 excluding special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses was 07 million 05 million and 06 million respectively the company recognized special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2009 2008 and 2007 of 09 million 94 million and 14 million respectively 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company settled its pension obligations under a plan covering employees of the former kentucky west virginia gas company llc an eqt subsidiary which merged into eqt gathering llc in 2008 the former kentucky west virginia employees transferred to eqt gathering llc or eqt 

  

  

production company as a result of the settlement the company recognized pension settlement expense of approximately 8 million an additional 14 million of pension settlement losses were recognized in 2008 for lump sum payments made during the normal course of plan operations 

  

during 2007 the company recognized a settlem ent expense of 05 million due to a plan design change for a specific union and an additional settlement expense of 05 million due to the transfer of some current active employees to nonunion employment 

  

the company made cash contributions to its pension plan of approximately 116 million 34 million and 13 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as a result of the previously described settlements as well as additional contributions to meet certain funding targets under current law the company expects to make cash payments related to its pensions of 12 million in 2010 to meet the 80 funding obligations on its remaining plans pension plan cash contributions are designed to at least meet requirements of the 80 funding level the dollar amount of a cash contribution made in any particular year will vary as a result of gains or losses sustained by the plan during the year due to market conditions pension contributions will be funded by cash flow from operations or by borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements 

  

rate regulation 

  

the company’s distribution operations transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed as described in notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory accounting allows the company to defer expenses and income as regulatory assets and liabilities which reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

the following table details the undiscounted future projected payments associated with the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

  

   

purchase obligations primarily are commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines approximately 195 million of these obligations each year are believed to be recoverable in customer rates 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program in 2008 the company entered into an agreement with liberty avenue holdings llc to provide office space for the company’s new corporate headquarters the obligations for the company’s various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately 1255 million as of december 31 2009 the company has subleased some of these facilities sublease payments to the company total 213 million and are not netted from the amounts presented in the table above the company has agreements with highlands drilling llc patterson uti drilling company llc and other drilling contractors to provide drilling equipment and services to the company these obligations totaled approximately 353 million as of december 31 2009 in 2009 the company entered into an agreement with aop 

  

  

clearwater llc to secure capacity for the processing and disposal of salt water this obligation totaled 108 million as of december 31 2009 

  

the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2007 supply longterm incentive program and the 2008 executive performance incentive program see section titled “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations effective january 1 2010 the company adopted the 2010 executive performance incentive program and the 2010 stock incentive award program the company may adopt other plans in the future the contractual obligations do not include any payments under the 2010 executive performance incentive program the 2010 stock incentive award program or any potential future plans 

  

as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2009 of 566 million the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above 

  

contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

several west virginia lessors claimed in a suit filed on july 31 2006 that eqt production company had underpaid royalties on gas produced and marketed from leases the suit sought compensatory and punitive damages an accounting and other relief the plaintiffs later amended their complaint to name eqt as an additional defendant the company has settled the litigation the settlement covers all of the company’s lessors in west virginia who have not opted out of the settlement class the court has entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement a formal fairness hearing was held on january 20 2010 the company is waiting for entry of an order giving final approval of the settlement the company believes the reserve established for this litigation is sufficient 

  

in the ordinary course of business various other legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for these pending matters and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any other matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position results of operations or liquidity of the company 

  

see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates   

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon eqt’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed and approved by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities under this method all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves   if an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash 

  

  

flows the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit the depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred the company estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties the estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable those properties would be written down to fair value which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

  

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made unproved properties had a net book value of 1059 and 819 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively there were no significant unproved properties balances at december 31 2007 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which can be significantly impacted by management’s expectations regarding proved undeveloped drilling locations and its future development plans should the company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

oil and gas reserves  the company adopted sec rule modernization of oil and gas reporting as of december 31 2009   proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and reviewed by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance development plans prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a 12month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayof themonth price for each month within the 12month period operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future 

  

  

production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from pension and other post retirement benefits recorded in other comprehensive income federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other significant valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any change in the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions by first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position in a tax return will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position if this step is satisfied then the company must measure the tax position the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit realizable upon ultimate settlement to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed in making this determination the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement 

  

derivative commodity instruments  the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings see “commodity risk management” above item 7a—“quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding hedging activities 

  

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use as inputs marketbased 

  

  

parameters including but not limited to forward curves discount rates broker quotes volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

a substantial majority of the company’s derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be dedesignated the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings which could materially impact the results of operations one of the requirements for hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged effectiveness may be impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective the company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads credit ratings credit default swap rates and market activity 

  

in addition the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements given the company’s price risk management position and price volatility the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because t he company’s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedges due to changes in estimates of nonperformance risk and by changes in margin requirements as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of 314 million and 163 million respectively 

  

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

the company also accrues a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells t he fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company increases the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

  

share based compensation the company has awarded sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 and 2009 longterm incentive plans the company treats certain of its executive performance incentive programs including the 2008 executive performance incentive program 2008 epip and the 2007 supply longterm incentive program 2007 supply program as liability awards the actual cost to be recorded for these plans will not be known until the measurement date requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date the company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts 

  

approximately 70000 units were granted under the 2008 epip the payout of this program will be between zero and three times this number of units valued at the price of the company’s common stock at the end of the performance period december 31 2011 the payout multiple is dependent upon the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group’s total shareholder return and the downward discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors if the company does not attain a specified revenue target as of december 31 2009 approximately 270000 awards were outstanding under the 2007 supply program the awards earned may be increased to a maximum of three times the initial award or reduced to zero based upon achievement of the predetermined production sales revenue and efficiency targets in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company increased its assumption for the payout multiple to approximately 290 of the units awarded the performance period for the 2007 supply program ends on december 31 2010 

  

assuming no change in the current payout multiple assumptions for both programs a 10 increase in the company’s stock price assumptions for the 2008 epip and the 2007 supply program would have resulted in an increase in 2009 compensation expense under these plans of approximately 2 million 

  

the compensation committee of the board of directors adopted the 2009 shareholder value plan 2009 svp in december 2008 a total of 977600 units were granted under the plan the payout of this award depended on a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group and the company’s average absolute return on total capital during the performance period of january 1 2005 to december 31 2009 payout of awards could be between zero and 250 of the number of units awarded at the price of the company’s common stock at the end of the performance period december 31 2009 the vesting of the stock units granted under this award occurred on december 31 2009 and resulted in approximately 22 million units 225 of the award with a value of approximately 45 million being distributed in cash on december 31 2009 

  

effective january 1 2010 the company adopted the 2010 executive performance incentive program and the 2010 stock incentive award program the company may adopt other plans in the future the company has not recorded an obligation under the 2010 executive performance incentive program the 2010 stock incentive award program or any potential future plans at december 31 2009 

  

the 1999 and 2009 longterm incentive plans permit the grant of restricted stock awards and nonqualified stock options to employees of the company for time restricted stock awards compensation expense which is based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the majority of the timebased restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the threeyear period commencing with the date of grant for nonqualified stock options compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s stock expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the company’s shares the volatility of the company’s shares market interest rates and the various performance factors the impact on net income of these changes can be material 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative commodity instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through the eqt production and eqt midstream segments the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k the company uses nonleveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is continually monitored the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10 increase or a 10 decrease in commodity prices 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels 

  

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company include futures contracts swap agreements collar agreements and option contracts which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity the company also considers options and other contractual agreements in implementing its commodity hedging strategy 

  

management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to ensure an adequate level of return for the well development and infrastructure investment at eqt production and eqt midstream 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2009 the company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2015 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 1429 bcf of natural gas see the “commodity risk management” in the “capital resources and liquidity” sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k for further discussion a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2009 levels would increase the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 669 million a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2009 levels would decrease the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 642 million 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal determination of fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2009 the price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s balance sheet resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative 

  

  

commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the commodity futures trading commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from any potential financial instability of the exchange members the company’s swap collar and option derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and thus are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as that industry as a whole 

  

the company utilizes various processes and analysis to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures this includes closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits to manage the level of credit risk the company deals with financial counterparties that are of investment grade or better enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 54 or 1445 million of otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2009 have a positive fair value all derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2009 are with counterparties having an sp rating of a or above at that date 

  

in september 2008 the credit support provider of one counterparty lehman brothers holding inc declared bankruptcy resulting in a default under various derivative contracts with the company as a result those contracts were terminated and a reserve of approximately 5 million was recorded against the entire balance due to the company there is no additional income statement exposure to this counterparty beyond the reserve recorded in 2008 as of december 31 2009 the company was not in default under any derivative contracts and has no knowledge of default by any other counterparty to derivative contracts the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal nonperformance risk adjustment included in the company’s established fair value procedure the company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheet 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas to certain marketers including the company’s wholly owned marketing subsidiary eqt energy and utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area additionally a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt midstream is generated from the sale of produced natural gas liquids to a gas processor in kentucky and gathering of natural gas in kentucky virginia pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that matures on october 26 2011 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company lehman is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding 95 million under the facility lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to 1405 

  

  

million as of december 31 2009 the company had outstanding under the facility 50 million of loans in support of corporate activities and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of 244 million 

  

no one lender in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to otherwise limit the company’s exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry

part iv 

  




 item 1 business   general 

  

eqt corporation formerly equitable resources inc eqt or the company is one of appalachia’s largest exploration and production companies with over three trillion cubic feet of proved reserves at december 31 2008 the company and its subsidiaries offer energy products natural gas ngls and a limited amount of crude oil and services to wholesale and retail customers in the united states the company conducts its business through three business segments eqt production eqt midstream and equitable distribution 

  

the company’s proved reserves grew 16 from 2007 to 3110 bcfe at december 31 2008 over the past five years the company’s proved reserves have grown 47 as a result of the company’s drilling program and investment in drilling technology 

  

   

the company’s reserves are located entirely in the appalachian basin a production area characterized by wells with long lives low production costs natural gas containing high energy content and close proximity to 

  

  

natural gas markets many of the company’s wells have been producing for decades in some cases since the early 1900s 

  

the company’s proved reserves have discounted future net cash flows before income taxes of 3245 million 2012 million after tax at december 31 2008 this standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated using adjusted yearend prices in accordance with sfas no 69 see note 24 unaudited to the company’s consolidated financial statements for information regarding reserves reserve activity costs and the standard measure of discounted future cash flows 

  

while the natural gas exploration and production industry can be volatile as market prices fluctuate management believes that the following factors position the company to achieve solid relative returns for shareholders over time 

  

   

production eqt’s strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing the company’s extensive acreage position enabled by a low cost structure the company is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program and believes that it is a technological leader in drilling in low pressure shale in particular the use of air in horizontal drilling has proven to be a cost effective technology which the company has efficiently deployed to various geological formations in the appalachian mountain terrain and may be deployed to other company assets in the basin to maximize production 

  

in addition to horizontal air drilling an activity in which the company believes it is a technological leader the company’s drilling innovations include drilling reentry wells where low pressured vertical shale wells were previously drilled drilling multilateral and stacked multilateral horizontal wells and refracing existing vertical wells 

  

eqt production’s drilling has been concentrated within the core areas of southwestern virginia southeastern kentucky west virginia and pennsylvania and in four major plays huron coalbed methane berea and marcellus in each of its plays the company drills low risk development wells into reservoirs that are known to be productive 

  

the company has recently focused drilling in the huron play which includes the lower huron cleveland and rhinestreet formations and on the coalbed methane play eqt has approximately 22 million acres in the huron play in 2008 the company ramped up its development programs for the emerging berea sandstone and marcellus plays the company has approximately 800000 acres in the berea play where it expects to drill 40 wells in 2009 and over 400000 acres in the marcellus play where it expects to drill 45 wells including 20 horizontal wells in 2009 

  

the company believes that it will continue to increase production volumes and proved reserves based on the quality of the underlying asset base drilling activities resulted in proved developed reserve additions of approximately 293 bcfe in 2008 of the proved developed reserve additions approximately 49 bcfe related to proved undeveloped reserves that were transferred to proved developed reserves the company’s 2008 extensions discoveries and other additions of 585 bcfe was 646 of 2008 production of 906 bcfe 

  

  

   

the company spent approximately 701 million on well development primarily drilling in 2008 sales volumes increased 12 in 2008 adjusted for the 2007 sale of interests which provided sales of 1966 mmcfe during 2007 

  

capital spending for well development primarily drilling in 2009 is expected to be approximately 600 million to support the drilling of up to 675 gross wells including 375 gross horizontal wells sales volumes are expected to reach 9697 bcfe in 2009 a substantial portion of the company’s 2009 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in the huron play where midstream pipeline and processing capacity are largely in place current capital market conditions were considered when the 2009 capital program was developed the company currently anticipates that the capital spending plan will not require the company to access capital markets through the end of 2010 even so the company anticipates natural gas sales volume growth of 15 in 2009 if the capital markets become unconstrained the company believes it has a longterm sales volume growth potential of greater than 20 per year 

  

   

  

midstream eqt midstream provides gathering processing transmission and storage services to eqt production and independent third parties in 2008 eqt midstream focused on building a longterm growth platform highlighted by the construction of the big sandy pipeline the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant and the mayking corridor this infrastructure development facilitates the development of eqt production’s growing reserve base in the huron play and provides opportunities to sell capacity to third parties in 2009 eqt midstream will focus on continuing to expand its gathering system through well connections to existing midstream infrastructure and thereby filling existing capacity additionally initial infrastructure expansion in the marcellus play in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia is slated for 2009

  

as of december 31 2008 eqt midstream’s gathering system included approximately 10450 miles of gathering lines located in western pennsylvania west virginia eastern kentucky and southwestern virginia  the company also has a gas processing facility kentucky hydrocarbon located in langley kentucky transmission and storage operations include approximately 970 miles of lines located throughout eastern kentucky north central west virginia and southwestern pennsylvania the transmission and storage system interconnects with five major interstate pipelines texas eastern transmission columbia gas transmission national fuel gas supply tennessee gas pipeline and dominion transmission eqt midstream also has 14 natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 496 mmcf per day of peak delivery capability and 63 bcf of storage capacity of which 32 bcf is working gas these storage reservoirs are geographically clustered with eight in northern west virginia and six in southwestern pennsylvania in addition eqt midstream through e quitrans lp equitrans the company’s interstate pipeline affiliate and equitable energy llc equitable energy the company’s gas marketing affiliate leased 63 bcf of contractual storage and 138500 dth per day of contractual pipeline capacity from third parties as of december 31 2008 

  

in 2008 equitable energy executed a binding precedent agreement with tennessee gas pipeline company tgp a wholly owned subsidiary of el paso corporation for a 15year term that awarded the company 300000 dth per day of capacity in tgp’s 300line expansion project when completed this expansion project will consist of approximately 128 miles of 30inch pipe loop and approximately 52000 horsepower of additional compression facilities to be constructed in tgp’s existing pipeline corridor in pennsylvania and new jersey the awarded capacity will provide eqt access to consumer markets from the gulf coast to the midatlantic and the northeast and will also provide backhaul capacity of 300000 dth per day to the gulf coast 

  

capital expenditures for midstream infrastructure were 594 million in 2008 during 2008 the company turned in line the mayking corridor project mayking which consists of three compressor units and 38 miles of pipe completed an expansion of the kentucky hydrocarbon facility which increased its gas processing capacity from 70 mmcfe per day to 170 mmcfe per day and turned in line the big sandy pipeline which connects the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant to the tennessee gas pipeline in carter county kentucky and currently provides up to 130000 dth per day of firm transportation service the big sandy pipeline capacity is expandable with additional compression 

  

capital expenditures on midstream infrastructure projects in 2009 will be reduced to 360 million as a result of the shift in focus from completing major infrastructure projects to expanding the gathering system in areas with existing midstream infrastructure this will facilitate moving a greater volume of eqt production’s gas to market if the capital markets become less constrained eqt midstream will consider increasing investment in corridor infrastructure projects to provide additional capacity needed to facilitate production growth 

  

distribution equitable distribution’s business strategy is to earn a competitive return on its asset base through regulatory mechanisms and operational efficiency equitable distribution is focused on enhancing the value of its existing assets by establishing a reputation for excellent customer service effectively managing its capital spending improving the efficiency of its workforce through superior work management and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations in 2008 equitable gas filed a base rate case in pennsylvania to recover an increased return on assets placed in service since the previous rate case and to fully recover costs associated with the customer assistance programs equitable distribution expects to spend approximately 30 million on capital expenditures in 2009 

  

  

equitable gas company equitable gas eqt’s regulated natural gas distribution subsidiary distributes and sells natural gas to local residential commercial and industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania west virginia and eastern kentucky equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania and provides offsystem sales activities the offsystem sales activities include the purchase and delivery of gas to customers at mutually agreedupon points on facilities not owned by the company 

  

equitable gas has made great strides over recent years towards achieving its operational goals for instance equitable gas pioneered the use of monthly automated meter readings throughout its pennsylvania service territory which has improved monthly billings and customer satisfaction the customer call center has demonstrated significantly improved operating performance in responding to customer inquiries and has added selfservice functionality ontime scheduled appointment performance has increased to its highest levels in recent years in a recent survey by the american gas association equitable gas’s damage prevention program scored in the top quartile of gas utility companies nationwide 

  

markets and customers 

  

natural gas sales   eqt production’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers including equitable energy utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area for the year ended december 31 2008 sales to one marketer accounted for approximately 13 of revenues for eqt production no customers accounted for more than 10 of revenues in 2007 or 2006 natural gas is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for natural gas can be volatile as evidenced by the high natural gas prices in early through mid 2008 followed by dramatic decreases later in the year the market price for gas located in the appalachian basin is generally higher than the price for gas located in the gulf coast largely due to the differential in the cost to transport gas to customers in the northeastern united states the company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

natural gas drilling activity in the appalachian basin increased during 2007 and the first half of 2008 as suppliers attempted to take advantage of higher natural gas prices and reacted to reported successes in the marcellus play this increased drilling activity placed constraints on the availability of labor equipment pipeline transport and other resources in the appalachian basin but also attracted higher quality rigs and additional service providers to the region and provided opportunities for expansion of natural gas gathering activities lower sales prices for natural gas in the latter part of 2008 reduced drilling activity in the appalachian basin but did not have a significant impact on the availability or cost of resources eqt production has qualified numerous vendors and service providers for key resources and is not dependent upon any single vendor or service provider to meet production or sales goals 

  

the increase in appalachian basin production intensified pressure on the already stretched capacity of existing gathering and midstream processing and transport systems in the appalachian basin as a result the company entered into third party firm contractual capacity arrangements amounting to 188318 dth per day as of december 31 2008 and discounted sales arrangements approximating 9500 dth per day as of december 31 2008 to obtain transportation capacity so that its gas continues to flow to market 

  

natural gas gathering   eqt midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin the gathering system volumes are transported to three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to geographically diverse markets 

  

gathering system transportation volumes for 2008 totaled 145031 bbtu of which approximately 53 related to gathering for eqt production 28 related to third party volumes and 10 related to volumes for other affiliates of the company the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company continued to operate for a fee revenues from affiliates accounted for approximately 80 of 2008 gathering revenues 

  

  

natural gas processing   the company processes natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline from the natural gas stream primarily from eqt production’s produced gas on a per energy unit basis these liquid hydrocarbons can typically be sold at a price premium versus natural gas the value of this premium is referred to as the frac spread as a result of market conditions the company experienced reduced frac spreads in the second half of 2008 

  

ngls are recovered at eqt’s kentucky hydrocarbon facility and transported to a fractionation plant owned by a third party for separation into commercial components the third party markets these components and in exchange retains an agreedupon percentage of ngls delivered by the company the company also has contractual processing arrangements whereby the company sells gas to a third party processor at a weighted average liquids component price 

  

while natural gas processing produces independent revenues the company’s primary reason for these activities is to comply with the product quality specifications of the pipelines on which the company’s produced natural gas is transported and sold as a result the company typically engages in gas processing at locations where its produced gas would not satisfy the downstream interstate pipeline’s gas quality specifications without sufficient processing the company’s natural gas production could be interrupted as a result of an inability to achieve required interstate pipeline specifications thus as the company’s production continues to grow its gas processing capacity must also grow 

  

natural gas transmission and storage services offered by equitable energy include commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services these operations are executed using company owned and operated or contracted transmission and underground storage facilities as well as other contractual capacity arrangements with major pipeline and storage service providers in the eastern united states equitable energy uses leased storage capacity and firm transportation capacity including the company’s big sandy pipeline capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities equitable energy also engages in energy trading and risk management activities for the company the objective of these activities is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets as a result of declining natural gas prices equitable energy experienced reduced storage and commercial margins in the second half of 2008

  

customers of eqt midstream’s gas transportation storage risk management and related services are affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and ugi energy services inc equitable energy’s commodity procurement sales delivery risk management and other services are offered to natural gas producers and energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers 

  

equitrans’ firm transportation contracts on its mainline system expire between 2009 and 2017 and the firm transportation contracts on its big sandy pipeline expire in 2018 the company anticipates that the capacity associated with these expiring contracts will be remarketed or used by affiliates such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed in 2008 approximately 78 of transportation volumes and approximately 83 of transportation revenues were from affiliates 

  

natural gas distribution equitable distribution provides natural gas distribution services to approximately 275800 customers consisting of 257200 residential customers and 18600 commercial and industrial customers in southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia these service areas have a rather static population and economy 

  

customer conservation as a result of product efficiency and increased natural gas prices has reduced residential customer usage over time despite the increasing availability of natural gas based products the company has not experienced a significant decrease in weather adjusted throughput or deterioration in customer collections due to the recent economic downturn if this downturn persists equitable distribution may experience a reduction in commercial and industrial throughput as well as an increase in bad debt expense which would reduce the return on its asset base 

  

  

equitable gas purchases gas through contracts with various sources including major and independent producers in the gulf coast local producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate the gas purchase contracts contain various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 71 of calendar year 2008 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during the offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

  

competition 

  

the combination of longlived production low drilling costs high drilling completion rates and p roximity to natural gas markets has resulted in a highly fragmented operating environment in the appalachian basin natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties the search for and development of reserves the production and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations competitors include major oil and gas companies other independent oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators key competitors for new gathering and processing systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated appalachian energy companies natural gas marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to endusers the company’s distribution operations face competition from other local distribution companies alternative fuels and reduced usage among customers as a result of conservation 

  

regulation 

  

eqt production’s natural gas operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations including regulations related to the location of wells drilling stimulating and casing of wells water withdrawal and disbursement for well stimulation purposes well production spill prevention plans the use transportation storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and taxes the plugging and abandoning of wells and the gathering of production in certain circumstances 

  

eqt production’s operations are also subject to conservation regulations including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties eqt production’s operating states allow in certain circumstances the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while in other circumstances it is necessary to rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop natural gas properties in addition state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of natural gas we produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we drill 

  

eqt midstream has both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated activities consist of federallyregulated transmission and storage operations and certain stateregulated gathering operations the nonregulated activities include certain gathering and transportation operations processing of ngls and risk management activities equitrans’ rates and operations are subject to regulation by the ferc the 2006 ferc rate case settlement allows equitrans among other things to institute an annual surcharge for the tracking and recovery of all costs operations maintenance and return on invested capital incurred on and after september 1 2005 related to equitrans’ pipeline safety program under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 the company has continued to utilize the surcharge mechanism each year to recover costs incurred in connection with its pipeline safety program under the terms of the 2006 settlement equitrans may not seek new base transmission and storage rates prior to june 1 2009 or new gathering base rates prior to november 1 2010 in 2008 the big sandy pipeline was placed in service in eastern kentucky big sandy’s initial rate agreements provide for a firm reservation charge of 1977 per maximum daily quantity for a term of ten years

  

  

equitable gas’ distribution rates terms of service and contracts with affiliates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the wv psc in addition the issuance of securities by equitable gas is subject to regulation by the pa puc  the field line sales rates in kentucky are subject to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission 

  

equitable gas must usually seek the approval of one or more of its regulators prior to changing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and transportation activities equitable gas is allowed to recover a return in addition to the costs of its transportation activities however equitable gas’ regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term equitable gas filed a base rate case in the second quarter of 2008 and reached a settlement in principal with the active parties to the proceeding in november 2008 the settlement must be approved by the pa puc to be effective on january 20 2009 a pa puc administrative law judge recommended that the pa puc approve of the rate case settlement the pa puc is expected to act before march 31 2009

  

pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers equitable gas has several such programs including the cap on september 27 2007 the pa puc issued an order approving an increase to equitable gas’ cap surcharge which is designed to offset the higher costs of the cap the revised surcharge went into effect on october 2 2007 if the rate case settlement is approved equitable gas will increase the cap surcharge from 058mcf to 130mcf and will receive an annual reconciliation of cap costs to ensure complete recovery beginning in the first quarter of 2009 

  

equitable gas has worked with and continues to work with regulators to implement alternative cost recovery programs equitable gas’ tariffs for commercial and industrial customers allow for negotiated rates in limited circumstances regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company is not aware of any significant noncompliance as a result of any completed audits

 item 1a   risk factors   

risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability future rate of growth and liquidity depend upon the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the proximity to and availability of capacity on transportation facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls 

  

lower natural gas prices may result in decreases in the construction of new transportation capacity decreased margin opportunities for our marketing and gathering services businesses and downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves which may cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings we are also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes positive or negative in natural gas prices result in derivative contracts with a positive fair value finally lower natural gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money and raise additional capital

  

increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap agreements and exchange traded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas 

  

the global financial challenges may adversely affect our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict downgrades to our credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing adversely affecting our business results of operations and liquidity 

  

we rely upon access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations continued challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition and we may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions the economic situation could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables market conditions could cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection the current economic situation could lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues and our credit ratings 

  

  

any downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could adversely affect our business results of operations and liquidity we cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our ratings could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish financial results 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

significant portions of our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are subject to state and federal regulation including regulation of the rates which we may assess our customers the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates 

  

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters these laws and regulations currently include legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety new and modified laws and regulations could include regulations regarding carbon cap and trade a carbon tax or other climate change matters and could cause the distribution business to expend capital not included in its budget to move and relocate lines in support of any federal stimulus package complying with existing and changing legal requirements could have a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position the failure to comply with these requirements even if as a result of factors beyond our control could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by eqt production which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability 

  

strategic determinations regarding the allocation of capital and other resources in the current economic environment are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our businesses may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

  

in developing our 2009 business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity midstream infrastructure distribution infrastructure corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2009 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we don’t optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected 

  

the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings we have expanded our drilling program in recent years and have announced plans to drill approximately 675 wells in 2009 including a target of 375 horizontal wells our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant 

  

  

risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

our failure to develop and maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

our delivery of gas depends upon the availability of adequate transportation infrastructure as previously announced 360 million of our 2009 capital expenditures are planned for investment in midstream infrastructure investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as processing adjacent to and curtailments on such pipelines  our infrastructure development and maintenance programs can involve significant risks including those related to timing cost overruns and operational efficiency and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors we also deliver to and are served by third party gas gathering transportation processing and storage facilities which are limited in number and geographically concentrated an extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities could result in adverse consequences to us 

  

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation storage and distribution of natural gas these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage as a result we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 

  

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions our decision to drill a prospect is subject to a number of factors which may alter our drilling schedule or our plans to drill at all we may have difficulty drilling all of the wells before the lease term expires which could result in the loss of certain leasehold rights or we could drill wells in locations where we do not have the necessary infrastructure to deliver the gas to market successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect our recent addition of exploration projects increases the risks inherent in our natural gas activities specifically seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our operations because we have a limited operating history in certain exploratory areas our future operating results are difficult to forecast and our failure to sustain high growth rates in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

stock performance graph 

  

the following graph compares the most recent fiveyear cumulative total return attained by shareholders on eqt corporation’s common stock with the cumulative total returns of the sp 500 index and two customized peer groups of eleven companies the “old selfconstructed peer group and twenty companies the “new selfconstructed peer group” respectively whose individual companies are listed respectively in footnotes 1 and 2 below an investment of 100 with reinvestment of all dividends is assumed to have been made at the close of business on december 31 2003 in the company’s common stock in the sp 500 index and in each peer group relative performance is tracked through december 31 2008 

  

  

   

1   the company’s old selfconstructed peer group includes eleven companies which are cms energy corporation energen corporation keyspan corporation kinder morgan inc national fuel gas company nisource inc oge energy corporation oneok inc peoples energy corporation questar corporation and southwestern energy company during 2007 keyspan corporation kinder morgan inc and peoples energy corporation completed significant transactions which resulted in those companies merging out of existence or going private those companies are included in the calculation from december 31 2003 through december 31 2006 at which time they are removed from the peer group calculation

2   the company’s new selfconstructed peer group includes twenty companies which are atlas energy resources llc cabot oil  gas corporation chesapeake energy corporation cnx gas corporation el paso corporation enbridge inc energen corporation markwest energy partners lp mdu resources group inc national fuel gas company oneok inc penn virginia corporation questar corporation range resources corporation sempra energy southern union 

  

  

company southwestern energy company spectra energy corp transcanada corp and the williams companies inc in future years the company generally will use this new selfconstructed peer group because the businesses operated by this selfconstructed peer group more closely reflect the businesses engaged in by the company as it has evolved from a diversified utility to an integrated energy company increasingly focused on natural gas exploration production and transportation in addition this peer group is the same as the peer group for the company’s 2008 executive performance incentive program

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

eqt’s consolidated income from continuing operations for 2008 was 2556 million 200 per diluted share compared with 2575 million 210 per diluted share for 2007 and 2160 million 177 per diluted share for 2006 

  

the 19 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2007 to 2008 reflects an increase in operating income of 1531 million which was more than offset by the absence of a 2007 pretax gain of 1261 million on the sale of assets in the nora area higher 2008 interest and income taxes and a 2008 otherthantemporary impairment loss on available for sale securities 

  

operating income for 2008 was impacted by decreased incentive compensation expense increased production revenues due to higher average wellhead sales prices and significantly higher volumes increased gathering and transmission revenues due to higher rates and volumes and the absence of 2007 transaction costs associated with the terminated peoples and hope acquisition the decreased incentive compensation expense was the result of the reversal of previously recorded expense on the company’s 2005 executive performance incentive program partially offset by increases in shortterm incentive compensation these items were partially offset by increased depletion depreciation and amortization increased operating and administrative expenses and the impact of the may 2007 asset sales 

  

the 415 million increase in income from continuing operations from 2006 to 2007 resulted from several factors including the 2007 pretax gain of 1261 million on the sale of assets in the nora area at equitable distribution revenues increased primarily due to colder weather in equitable gas’s service territory at eqt midstream an increase in transmission and storage revenues due to increased storage asset optimization transactions and utilization of contractual transmission capacity to increase its wholesale marketing activities and an increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues due to higher frac spreads for ngls extracted in 2007 were partially offset by a decrease in revenues due to the 2006 favorable impact of the settlement of the equitrans rate case at eqt production revenues increased due to higher production sales volumes 

  

the increased revenue between 2006 and 2007 was partially offset by a 462 million increase in incentive compensation expense the 101 million writeoff of deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the proposed acquisition of peoples and hope and 97 million in higher depletion depreciation and amortization primarily at eqt production in addition higher labor costs and charges for certain legal reserves settlements and related expenses partially offset the increases in income from continuing operations 

  

the effective tax rate for 2008 was 377 compared to 359 in 2007 the higher effective tax rate in 2008 is the result of several factors including the company being in a net operating loss position for tax purposes in 2008 which results in the loss of certain deductions for 2008 and for prior years as a result of carrying losses back to receive a cash refund of taxes paid in addition state taxes increased due to limitations imposed on certain state tax losses generated in 2008 and the company recorded a net increase to tax expense as a result of the completion of its irs audit through the 2005 tax year slightly offset by a beneficial change in the west virginia state tax law the company’s effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 was 359 compared to 337 for the year ended december 31 2006 the higher effective tax rate in 2007 is the result of several factors including a change in the west virginia state tax law and a reduced 2006 rate resulting from the release of state valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryovers 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive expenses 

  

  

income and administrative expenses totaling 174 million 653 million and 219 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively were not allocated to business segments the unallocated income in 2008 primarily relates to the reversal of previously recorded performancerelated incentive expenses while the unallocated expense in 2007 and 2006 relates to performancerelated incentive expenses in those years 

  

the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the company’s consolidated operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income totals in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements additionally these subtotals are reconciled to the company’s consolidated net income in note 2 the company has also reported the components of each segment’s operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived eqt’s management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition operations and trends of each of eqt’s segments without being obscured by these items for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes 

  

eqt production 

  

overview 

  

eqt’s strategy is to maximize value by profitably developing the company’s extensive acreage position through organic growth enabled by a low cost structure the company is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program and believes that it is a technological leader in drilling in low pressure shale in particular the use of air in horizontal drilling has proven to be a cost effective technology which the company has efficiently deployed to various geological formations in the appalachian mountain terrain and which may be deployed to other company assets in the basin to maximize production 

  

the company drilled 668 gross wells 533 net wells in 2008 including 23 marcellus wells 16 vertical and 7 horizontal 24 horizontal berea wells and 357 horizontal wells targeting the lower huron p roved reserves increased 428 bcfe 16 to 3110 bcfe during the year 

  

eqt production’s revenues for 2008 increased approximately 26 compared to 2007 revenues gas sales volumes increased 12 from 2007 excluding volumes from properties sold during 2007 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2008 and 2007 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells wellhead sales prices increased approximately 16 as increased commodity market prices offset slightly lower hedge prices yearoveryear 

  

operating expenses at eqt production include an 82 million increase in the company’s exploration program the increase in exploration expense is a result of the company’s initiative to explore additional reserve opportunities in various exploration plays on its legacy acreage position with the purchase and interpretation of seismic data for unproved properties excluding exploration expenses 2008 operating expenses increased 21 primarily due to higher depletion resulting from increased drilling investments increased lease operating expenses due to increased production volumes and higher production taxes due to higher prices and volumes partially offset by the absence of 2007 charges for legal reserves settlements and related expenses 

  

  

results of operations 

  

   

a   natural gas and oil production represents the company’s interest in gas and oil production measured at the wellhead it is equal to the sum of total sales volumes and company usage line loss 

  

b   2007 capital expenditures include 244 million for the acquisition of working interests in wells in the roaring fork area 

  

c   production taxes include severance and productionrelated ad valorem and other property taxes 

  

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2008 vs december 31 2007 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 2528 million for 2008 compared to 2020 million for 2007 an increase of 508 million between years primarily due to a higher average wellhead sales price and increased gas sales volumes partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

  

total operating revenues were 4571 million for 2008 compared to 3644 million for 2007 the 927 million increase in operating revenues was due to higher realized prices and increased sales volumes the average wellhead sales price increase by 073 per mcfe primarily as a result of an increase in nymex natural gas prices and a higher percentage of unhedged gas sales partially offset by a lower realized hedge price additionally sales volumes increased 12 excluding the 2007 sale of interests which provided sales of 1966 mmcfe during 2007 as a result of the 2008 and 2007 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the company’s wells 

  

operating expenses totaled 2044 million for 2008 compared to 1624 million for 2007 the 420 million increase in operating expenses was a result of increases of 162 million in dda 110 million in production taxes 64 million in loe and 02 million in sga in addition the 2008 period includes an 82 million increase in exploration expense due to the purchase and interpretation of seismic data in support of the company’s examination of emerging plays the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate 99 million and volume 50 million the 011 increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the increase in production taxes was primarily due to a 98 million increase in severance taxes and a 12 million increase in property taxes the increase in severance taxes a production tax imposed on the value of gas extracted was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and higher sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the company’s wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes the increase in loe was attributable to personnel costs the 2008 program to test the refracturing of existing wells salt water and waste disposal environmental costs and road and location maintenance the increase in sga was primarily due to higher overhead costs associated with the growth of the company partially offset by lower charges for certain legal disputes in 2008 compared to 2007 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2007 vs december 31 2006 

  

eqt production’s operating income totaled 2020 million for 2007 compared to 2154 million for 2006 a decrease of 134 million between years primarily due to an increase in operating expenses partially offset by increased sales volumes 

  

total operating revenues were 3644 million for 2007 compared to 3595 million for 2006 the 49 million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a 1 increase in total sales volumes as a result of the 2007 and 2006 drilling programs net of the normal production decline in the company’s wells and was partially offset by the 2007 sale of interests which provided sales of 3044 mmcfe during 2006 in addition the average wellhead sales price decreased 001 per mcfe primarily due to a decrease in nymex natural gas prices partially offset by a higher percentage of unhedged gas sales and a higher realized hedge price 

  

operating expenses totaled 1624 million for 2007 compared to 1441 million for 2006 the 183 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 101 million in sga 86 million in dda and 15 million in loe excluding production taxes partially offset by a decrease of 21 million in production taxes the increase in sga was primarily due to increased legal reserves settlements and related expenses in 2007 compared to the reduction of certain liability reserves in 2006 partially offset by 2006 increases to the reserve established for uncollectible accounts the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate 69 million and volume 10 million the 008 increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the increase in loe excluding production taxes was attributable to personnel costs environmental costs and liability insurance costs the decrease in production taxes was primarily due to a decrease in severance taxes arising out of the sale of assets in the nora area

outlook 

  

eqt production’s business strategy is focused on organic growth of the company’s natural gas reserves and sales volumes key elements of eqt production’s strategy include 

  

·   expanding reserves and production through horizontal drilling in kentucky and west virginia the company is committed to expanding its reserves and production through horizontal drilling exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays and expanding its infrastructure in the appalachian basin the company will seek to maximize the value of its existing asset base by developing its large acreage position which the company believes holds significant production and reserve growth potential a substantial portion of the company’s 2009 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in kentucky and west virginia 

  

·   exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays in 2009 the company will examine the potential for exploitation of gas reserves in new geological formations and through different technologies plans include the drilling of horizontal berea and marcellus wells and testing the devonian shale in virginia in addition the company intends to obtain proprietary seismic data in order to evaluate future deep drilling opportunities in certain emerging plays

  

  

eqt midstream 

  

overview 

  

eqt midstream provides gathering processing transmission and storage services to eqt production and independent third parties in 2008 eqt midstream focused on building a longterm growth platform highlighted by the construction of the big sandy pipeline the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant and the mayking corridor this infrastructure development facilitates the development of eqt production’s growing reserve base in the huron play and provides opportunities to sell capacity to third parties in 2009 eqt midstream will focus on continuing to expand its gathering system through well connections to existing midstream infrastructure and thereby filling existing capacity additionally initial infrastructure expansion in the marcellus play in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia is slated for 2009 

  

eqt midstream achieved a number of operational milestones in 2008 in the second half of the year eqt midstream completed construction on the expansion of the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant and gas compression facilities kentucky hydrocarbon and turned in line the mayking corridor project mayking kentucky hydrocarbon has the capacity to process 170 mmcfe of natural gas per day mayking consists of three compressor units and 38 miles of pipe in the second quarter the big sandy pipeline a 68mile pipeline that connects kentucky hydrocarbon to the tennessee gas pipeline and currently provides up to 130000 dth per day of firm transportation service came online the combination of kentucky hydrocarbon mayking and the big sandy pipeline provide the platform for significant sales growth starting in the fourth quarter of 2008 and beyond and will help to mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the company’s gathering systems in transporting gas to market 

  

also in 2008 equitable energy executed a binding precedent agreement with tgp for a 15year term that along with other contractual provisions awarded the company 300000 dth per day of capacity in tgp’s 300line expansion project when completed this expansion project will consist of approximately 128 miles of 30inch pipe loop and approximately 52000 horsepower of additional compression facilities to be constructed in tgp’s existing pipeline corridor in pennsylvania and new jersey the awarded capacity will provide equitable energy access to consumer markets along the tgp longline transmission system from the gulf coast to the midatlantic and the northeast united states 

  

eqt midstream’s net operating revenues increased by 16 from 2007 to 2008 this increase was primarily due to increases in the average gathering fee higher processing net revenues and transmission revenues from the big sandy pipeline increases in net operating revenues were more than offset by an increase in operating expenses which included 107 million for the settlement of certain pension and postretirement benefits including related severance and legal fees 

  

during may 2007 the eqt midstream segment contributed certain nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to nora gathering llc a newly formed entity that is equally owned by the company and pine mountain oil and gas inc pmog in exchange for a 50 equity interest in the llc and cash see note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction as a result of the gathering asset contribution gathered volumes gathering revenues and gatheringrelated expenses related to the nora area gathering activities are no longer included in eqt midstream’s operating results beginning in the second quarter of 2007 however eqt midstream records its 50 equity interest in the earnings of nora gathering llc in equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments also in 2007 eqt purchased certain gathering assets in the roaring fork area from the minority interest holders see note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction 

  

  

results of operations

eqt midstream’s operating income totaled 1348 million for 2008 compared to 1404 million for 2007 a decrease of 56 million between years an increase in net operating revenues was more than offset by increased operating expenses including a 107 million settlement charge for pension and postretirement benefits including related severance and legal fees and 52 million bad debt expense as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy excluding these items operating income increased 7 

  

total net operating revenues were 3033 million for 2008 compared to 2619 million for 2007 the 414 million increase in total net operating revenues was due to a 260 million increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues and a 154 million increase in transmission and storage net operating revenues the increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues was due to a 17 increase in the average gathering fee increased ngls sold increased commodity prices for propane and other ngls and a small increase in gathered volumes the increase in the average gathering fee is reflective of the company’s commitment to ensuring that this fee is sufficient to cover costs associated with infrastructure expansion the volume of ngls sold increased in 2008 as a result of the company’s infrastructure investments gathered volumes increased 1 due to the increase in 2008 company production and third party volumes which were partially offset by the elimination in 2008 of volumes gathered on assets contributed to nora gathering llc the increase in transmission and storage net operating revenues was due to new transmission revenues from the big sandy pipeline which came online in the second quarter of 2008 and increased third party marketing that utilized big sandy pipeline capacity 

  

total operating revenues increased by 899 million or 15 primarily as a result of higher sales prices on increased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets an increase in processing volumes and commodity prices higher gathering rates and new transmission revenues from the big sandy pipeline total purchased gas costs increased due to the higher gas costs on increased commercial activity related to contractual transmission and storage assets as well as higher gas costs related to processing activities 

  

operating expenses totaled 1686 million for 2008 compared to 1215 million for 2007 the 471 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 202 million in sga 184 million in om and 85 

  

  

million in dda the increase in sga was primarily due to labor and services to support the growth in the midstream business a 52 million reserve against lehman brothers receivables and 12 million for legal and actuarial services associated with the pension and other postretirement charge partially offset by decreased sga for the gathering assets contributed to nora gathering llc the increase in om resulted mainly from the 95 million pension and other postretirement charge as well as increased electricity charges compressor maintenance labor and nonincome taxes for the gathering and processing business due to new compressors and processing facilities partially offset by the expenses associated with gathering asset contributed to nora gathering llc the increase in dda was primarily due to the increased investment in infrastructure during 2008 partially offset by decreased depreciation relating to the gathering asset contribution to nora gathering llc 

  

other income represents allowance for equity funds used during construction the 16 million decrease from 2007 to 2008 was primarily caused by a full year of afudc on big sandy recorded in 2007 as compared to only a partial year in 2008 as big sandy was placed online in the second quarter of 2008 

  

equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled 51 million for 2008 compared to 26 million for 2007 this increase is related to equity earnings recorded for eqt midstream’s investment in nora gathering llc which was formed in may 2007 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2007 vs december 31 2006 

  

eqt midstream’s operating income totaled 1404 million for 2007 compared to 1372 million for 2006 an increase of 32 million between years an increase in net operating revenues was largely offset by increased operating expenses 

  

total net operating revenues were 2619 million for 2007 compared to 2534 million for 2006 the 85 million increase in total net operating revenues was due primarily to increases in gathering and processing net operating revenues partially offset by a decrease in transmission and storage net operating revenues the 93 million increase in gathering and processing net operating revenues was due to higher sales prices for the ngl products sold in 2007 as compared to 2006 a 2 increase in ngl volumes sold and a 6 increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by a 9 decline in gathered volumes commodity market prices for propane and other ngls increased significantly in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the company’s commitment to ensuring that this fee is sufficient to cover costs associated with infrastructure expansion the decrease in gathered volumes is primarily the result of a reduction in volumes gathered for eqt production due to the contribution of gathering facilities and pipelines to nora gathering llc partially offset by increased company production the 08 million decrease in transmission and storage net operating revenues was primarily due to the positive effect of the equitrans rate case settlement of 70 million recorded in 2006 partially offset by storage asset optimization realized in 2007 as the company used contractual storage capacity to capture unusually high summertowinter price spreads equitrans’ pipeline safety surcharge that was formally approved by the ferc in november 2007 and increased firm transportation rates year over year the storage price spreads were captured at a time of high volatility and the transactions settled in 2007 

  

operating expenses totaled 1215 million for 2007 compared to 1162 million for 2006 the 53 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 24 million in om and 14 million in sga 10 million in impairment charge reversals recorded in 2006 and an increase of 05 million in dda the increase in om was due to increased expense in 2007 for the company’s gathering and transmission facilities primarily due to increased electricity charges on newly installed electric compressors increased field line and compressor maintenance increased field labor and related employment costs increased compliance and maintenance costs and increased fleetrelated costs as well as the recognition of 07 million of pipeline safety costs that were deferred pending the ferc order on the equitrans pipeline safety surcharge partially offsetting these increases in om were a decrease in om expenses relating to the gathering asset contribution to nora gathering llc and a decrease due to a 2006 pension and other postretirement benefits charge of 33 million for an early retirement program relating to the gathering and processing business the increase in sga is primarily due to higher labor costs including higher incentive compensation costs partially offset by decreased sga for the gathering assets contributed to nora gathering llc the increase in dda was primarily due to the increased investment in gathering infrastructure during 2007 partially offset by decreased depreciation relating to the gathering asset contribution to nora gathering llc

  

  

other income represents afudcequity and the 62 million increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily the result of increased capital spending for the big sandy pipeline as well as spending on pipeline safety and integrity projects 

  

equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled 26 million for 2007 and related to equity earnings recorded for eqt midstream’s investment in nora gathering llc 

  

see the “capital resources and liquidity” section for discussion of eqt midstream’s capital expenditures during 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

outlook 

  

eqt midstream is focused on building a longterm growth platform to facilitate the development of eqt production’s growing reserve base in 2009 under current capital market conditions eqt midstream will fill existing capacity by building smaller gathering lines in kentucky west virginia and pennsylvania to tie in wells this will facilitate the delivery of gas from wells drilled by eqt production in 2009 and will provide additional capacity to help mitigate curtailments increase the flexibility and reliability of the company’s gathering systems in transporting gas to market and provide additional capacity for growth eqt midstream will also make the initial infrastructure expansion in the company’s marcellus play in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia in addition processing upgrades to the kentucky hydrocarbon plant are planned if the capital markets become less constrained eqt midstream will consider increasing investment in corridor infrastructure projects to provide additional capacity needed to facilitate production growth

  

  

equitable distribution 

  

overview 

  

equitable distribution’s business strategy is to earn a competitive return on its asset base through regulatory mechanisms and operational efficiency equitable distribution is focused on enhancing the value of its existing assets by establishing a reputation for excellent customer service effectively managing its capital spending improving the efficiency of its workforce through superior work management and continuing to leverage technology throughout its operations 

  

in 2008 equitable gas filed a base rate case in pennsylvania to recover an increased return on assets placed in service since the previous rate case and to fully recover costs associated with the cap in november 2008 equitable gas reached a settlement with the active parties that would result in a projected revenue increase of approximately 38 million annually compared to the requested increase of 519 million the settlement must be approved by the pa puc to be effective on january 20 2009 a pa puc administrative law judge recommended approval of the rate case settlement by the pa puc the pa puc approval is expected before march 31 2009

  

if approved this settlement will result in the first delivery rate increase for equitable gas in more than a decade since 1997 equitable gas has invested more than 360 million to upgrade its pipeline infrastructure improve the efficiency of its operations and enhance the quality of its customer service as a result of these investments the company now ranks among the highest in pennsylvania in gas utility call center service levels and has achieved documented improvements in ontime scheduled appointment performance and safety 

  

pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers equitable gas has several such programs including the cap on september 27 2007 the pa puc issued an order approving an increase to equitable gas’s cap surcharge which is designed to offset the costs of the cap the revised surcharge went into effect on october 2 2007 if the rate case settlement is approved equitable gas will increase the cap surcharge from 058 per mcf to 130 per mcf and will receive an annual reconciliation of cap costs to ensure complete recovery beginning in the first quarter of 2009 

  

equitable distribution’s net operating revenues increased 6 from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the increase in surcharges collected to support cap and colder weather in equitable gas’ service territory in 2008 the weather in equitable gas’ service territory in 2008 was 5 colder than 2007 but was still 4 warmer than the 30year national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa average for the company’s service territory the weather in 2007 was 9 warmer than the 30year average total operating expenses decreased 12 from 2007  primarily due to the absence of transaction and transition planning costs related to the terminated peoples and hope acquisition incurred in 2007 partially offset by a 2008 increase in cap expenses these increased cap costs were recovered through an increase in collected cap surcharge

  

on march 1 2006 the company entered into an agreement to acquire dominion’s natural gas distribution assets in pennsylvania and in west virginia for approximately 970 million subject to adjustments in a cash transaction for the stock of peoples and hope in light of the continued delay in achieving the legal approvals for this transaction the company and dominion agreed to terminate the agreement pursuant to a mutual termination agreement entered into on january 15 2008 as a result in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company recognized a charge of 101 million for acquisition costs that were previously deferred 

  

  

results of operations 

  

   

fiscal year ended december 31 2008 vs december 31 2007 

  

equitable distribution’s operating income totaled 599 million for 2008 compared to 345 million for 2007 the 254 million increase in operating income is primarily due to increased cap surcharge revenues colder weather and lower sga expenses due to the absence in 2008 of costs associated with the now terminated peoples and hope acquisition 

  

net operating revenues were 1709 million for 2008 compared to 1606 million for 2007 the 103 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily a result of increased cap surcharge revenues the cap surcharge increased from 030 per mcf to 058 per mcf in the fourth quarter of 2007 additionally 2008 weather was 5 colder than the prior year commercial and industrial revenues increased due to an increase in performancebased revenues as well as increased volumes of 1532 mmcf from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to an increase in usage by one industrial customer offsystem and energy services net operating revenues increased due to increased gathering revenue as a result of increased volumes and rates partially offset by lower volumes and margins in asset 

  

  

optimization activities additionally an increase in the commodity component of residential tariff rates resulted in an increase in both total operating revenues and purchased gas costs 

  

operating expenses totaled 1110 million for 2008 compared to 1261 million for 2007 this 151 million decrease was primarily due to the impact of 210 million in 2007 costs related to the now terminated peoples and hope acquisition a 25 million decrease in incentive compensation expenses and a 18 million reduction in insurance reserves due to increased safety measures partially offsetting these decreases were a 55 million increase in customer assistance expenses resulting from a significant increase in customer participation in the cap and a 26 million increase in operating expenses primarily related to increased leak repair and maintenance activities for gathering operations service line maintenance and line location requests and higher gas prices  additionally there was a 21 million increase in depreciation due to an adjustment in asset estimated useful lives resulting from the pa pucmandated asset service life study as well as increased capital expenditures 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2007 vs december 31 2006 

  

equitable distribution’s operating income totaled 345 million for 2007 compared to 418 million for 2006 an increase in net operating revenues was more than offset by increased operating expenses primarily related to the fourth quarter of 2007 writeoff of deferred acquisition costs that resulted from the termination of the agreement to acquire peoples and hope 

  

net operating revenues were 1606 million for 2007 compared to 1507 million for 2006 the 99 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily a result of weather that was 7 colder than the prior year resulting in a 2480 mmcf increase in residential sales and transportation volumes from 2006 to 2007 commercial and industrial volumes increased 2130 mmcf from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to an increase in usage by one industrial customer these high volume industrial sales have very low margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues 

  

operating expenses totaled 1261 million for 2007 compared to 1089 million for 2006 operating expenses for 2007 included a 101 million writeoff of costs previously deferred related to the now terminated agreement to acquire peoples and hope while 2006 included a onetime benefit of 14 million from the partial reversal of a 2005 impairment charge in connection with the company’s office consolidation other increases in operating expenses included higher corporate overhead allocations increased labor costs including information technology enhancements and costs associated with a customer experience study of equitable gas customers these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense as a result of the continued organizational focus on collections which resulted in reductions in delinquent accounts receivable and net writeoffs 

  

outlook 

  

as described above equitable gas reached a settlement of its pennsylvania rate case that if approved will result in a projected revenue increase of approximately 38 million annually the new rates are expected to go into place no later than march 31 2009 with the first full year impact realized in 2010 results the rate increase will allow equitable distribution to earn an improved return on its asset base under the terms of the rate case settlement equitable gas will also reduce exposure to the cost of puc mandated customer assistance programs through a reconcilable surcharge 

  

customer conservation which has occurred over time as a result of product efficiency and higher natural gas prices has reduced residential customer usage over time the company has not however experienced a significant decrease in weather adjusted throughput or deterioration in customer collections in 2008 compared to recent levels if the current economic downturn persists equitable distribution may experience a reduction in commercial and industrial throughput as well as an increase in bad debt expense which would reduce the return on its asset base 

  

  

other income statement items 

  

   

during 2007 the eqt production segment sold to pmog a portion of the company’s interests in certain gas properties in the nora area totaling approximately 74 bcf of proved reserves also during 2007 the eqt midstream segment contributed certain nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to nora gathering llc in exchange for a 50 equity interest in nora gathering llc and cash these transactions resulted in a net gain of 1261 million see note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 

  

as discussed in note 10 to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company’s availableforsale investments consist of equity and bond funds intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the company selfinsures at december 31 2008 these investments had a fair market value which was 78 million below cost the company analyzed the decline in these investments based on the extent and duration of the impairment the nature of the underlying assets and the company’s intent and ability to hold the investments although the company holds these investments to fund longterm liabilities based on the extent and duration of the impairment combined with current market conditions the company concluded that the decline was otherthantemporary as such the company recognized a 78 million impairment in earnings in 2008 

  

also discussed in note 10 to the company’s consolidated financial statements in 2007 the company reviewed its investment portfolio including its investment allocation and sold equity funds with a cost basis of 63 million for total proceeds of 73 million resulting in the company recognizing a gain of 10 million 

  

in 2008 2007 and 2006 other income primarily relates to the equity portion of afudc prior to 2007 the equity portion of afudc was not significant and was included as an offset to interest expense in the statements of consolidated income as a result of the significance of the carrying costs related to the big sandy pipeline and other regulated projects afudc equity has been reclassified to other income in the statements of consolidated income for all periods presented afudc increased substantially in 2007 as a result of the substantial investment in the big sandy pipeline then under construction construction was completed in the second quarter 2008 reducing afudc in the current year 

  

the company’s noresco business is classified as discontinued operations due to the sale of the noresco domestic business in 2005 and sale of the company’s remaining international investment in early 2006 income from discontinued operations for 2006 included a tax benefit of 32 million due to a reduced tax liability on the sale of the domestic business and aftertax income of 11 million resulting from the company’s reassessment of its remaining obligations for costs incurred related to the sale of the domestic business 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense increased by 107 million from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the company’s investment in drilling and midstream infrastructure during 2007 and 2008 this investment was partially funded by the issuance of 500 million of 65 notes in march 2008 the interest expense associated with these notes was partially offset by a 23 decrease in the average shortterm interest rate during 2008 

  

  

interest expense decreased by 08 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of the repayment of longterm debt a 12 increase in the weighted average annual shortterm interest rate was more than offset by an overall reduction in weighted average net shortterm debt outstanding in part due to the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year 

  

weighted average annual interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt were 35 58 and 46 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

overview 

  

the company’s primary sources of cash during 2008 were proceeds from a public offering of the company’s common stock and from a public offering of senior notes and cash flows from operating activities the company used the cash primarily to fund its capital program and to repay shortterm notes 

  

operating activities 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 5092 million for 2008 as compared to 4267 million for 2007 a net increase of 825 million in cash flows provided by operating activities between years the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a net cash refund related to income taxes of 140 million in 2008 compared to a net cash payment of 634 million in 2007 for federal income tax purposes the company typically deducts as intangible drilling costs idc approximately 70 of its vertical drilling costs and 75 of its horizontal drilling costs in the year incurred the idc deduction resulting from its drilling program coupled with accelerated tax depreciation for expansion of the gathering infrastructure put the company into an overall federal tax net operating loss position in 2008 this tax position is likely to continue so long as expansion in appalachia continues as such the company expects minimal federal cash taxes for the foreseeable future  

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 4267 million for 2007 as compared to 6178 million for 2006 a net decrease of 1911 million in cash flows provided by operating activities between years the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following 

  

·   a 59 million increase in cash required for margin deposits on the company’s natural gas hedge agreements in 2007 compared to a 3178 million decrease in cash required for margin deposits in 2006 the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to significantly higher than normal gas prices in 2005 which resulted in increased deposit remittances in that year 

  

·   a decrease in accounts receivable of 25 million in 2007 compared to a decrease in accounts receivable of 635 million in 2006 the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005 

  

partially offset by 

  

·   an increase in other current liabilities of 994 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of 319 million in 2006 primarily related to incentive compensation plans and the timing of related payments 

  

·   an increase in accounts payable of 659 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of 293 million in 2006 the increase in accounts payable in 2007 was primarily the result of increased capital spending while the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 

  

  

investing activities 

  

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 13760 million for 2008 as compared to 5901 million for 2007 a net increase of 7859 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years the increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following 

  

·   an increase in capital expenditures to 13440 million in 2008 from 7767 million in 2007 see discussion of capital expenditures below 

  

·   capital contributions of 290 million to nora gathering llc in 2008 for use in midstream infrastructure projects 

  

·   the absence in 2008 of proceeds of 2170 million received in 2007 from the sale and contribution of assets see note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 5901 million for 2007 as compared to 4063 million for 2006 a net increase of 1838 million in cash flows used in investing activities between years the increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the following 

  

·   an increase in capital expenditures to 7767 million in 2007 from 4031 million in 2006 see discussion of capital expenditures below 

  

·   the company’s purchase of an additional working interest of approximately 135 in the roaring fork area in virginia for 281 million in 2007 

  

partially offset by 

  

·   proceeds of 2170 million received in 2007 from the sale and contribution of assets see note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

capital expenditures 

  

   

   includes 244 million and 37 million in the well development and midstream infrastructure categories respectively for the acquisition of additional working interest and related gathering assets in the roaring fork area see note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the company is committed to profitably expanding its reserves and production through horizontal drilling exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays and expanding its infrastructure in the appalachian basin however in light of the current capital market conditions the company has developed a plan to reduce capital spending significantly for 2009 as compared to 2008 and anticipates that this capital spending plan will not require the company to access capital markets through the end of 2010 this plan will be funded by the company’s cash flow from operating activities as well as a portion of the company’s 15 billion revolving credit facility the company remains flexible to reduce capital spending to operating cash flow levels should market conditions further deteriorate the company anticipates annual gas sales volume growth of 15 in 2009 

  

  

through concentrating spending on drilling where midstream capacity has already been built if the capital markets become unconstrained the company believes it has a longterm production growth potential of greater than 20 per year the company’s forecasted 2009 capital expenditures contemplate up to 675 gross wells including 375 horizontals 

  

capital expenditures for drilling and development totaled 701 million and 328 million during 2008 and 2007 respectively the company drilled 668 gross wells including 389 gross horizontal wells in 2008 compared to 634 gross wells including 88 gross horizontal wells during 2007 capital expenditures for 2008 also included 852 million for undeveloped property acquisitions primarily within the marcellus acreage 

  

capital expenditures for the midstream operations totaled 594 million and 434 million during 2008 and 2007 respectively these capital expenditures were used primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas pipelines and natural gas processing facilities included in such expenditures for 2008 was 366 million for gathering pipeline and compression including 105 million in the mayking corridor 105 million for the ranger liquids line project and kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant upgrade and 35 million for completion of the big sandy pipeline approximately 84 million of 2008 capital expenditures related to compliance line loss facilities and information technology 

  

capital expenditures for well development and midstream infrastructure increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increased drilling and development program in 2007 capital expended for the continued construction of the big sandy pipeline upgrades to the kentucky hydrocarbon plant and increased investment in gathering system compression and pipelines capital expenditures for distribution infrastructure decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the installation of electronic meter reading technology on meters in 2006 a project that was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2006 

  

financing activities 

  

cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 7851 million for 2008 as compared to 2451 million of cash flows provided by financing activities for 2007 the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable largely to the following 

  

·   net proceeds of 5607 million from a public offering of 8625 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2008 the proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including the company’s natural gas drilling development and midstream infrastructure projects 

  

·   a public offering during the first quarter of 2008 of 5000 million in aggregate principal of 650 senior notes the proceeds were used to repay shortterm borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility 

  

cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 2451 million for 2007 as compared to 2865 million of cash flows used in financing activities for 2006 a net increase of 5316 million in cash flows provided by financing activities between years the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable largely to a 3140 million increase in amounts borrowed under shortterm loans in 2007 compared to a 2293 million decrease in shortterm borrowings in 2006 the increase in shortterm borrowings in 2007 was for the purposes of funding capital expenditures and working capital requirements 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices in addition to funding working capital requirements which are significantly impacted by seasonality the company utilizes shortterm borrowings to fund margin deposit requirements until the underlying transactions are settled or the deposits are returned and to finance capital expenditures until they can be permanently financed the company’s 15 billion revolving credit facility matures on october 26 2011 the facility may be used for working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and other purposes including support of a commercial paper program 

  

  

the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company lehman brothers bank fsb lehman is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding 95 million under the facility lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to 1405 million otherwise the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit the company’s exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry 

  

as of december 31 2008 the company had outstanding under the revolving credit facility loans of 3199 million in support of corporate purposes and an irrevocable standby letter of credit of 258 million the weighted average interest rates on the company’s shortterm borrowings was 35 for 2008 the interest rate on the revolving credit facility fluctuates with the libor rate 

  

the company’s shortterm borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less 

  

security ratings and financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the current credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the company changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm and longterm debt and its access to the credit markets 

  

 

  

on october 15 2008 sp placed its ratings on eqt as well as three other diversified energy companies on creditwatch with negative implications “in light of an increasing percentage of operating income and capital spending that is related to oil and gas exploration and production ep activities” sp stated that it expected to resolve the creditwatch listing within three months but has not yet announced a decision 

  

on november 4 2008 moody’s reaffirmed its ratings on eqt and stated that the “rating reflects the diversification and vertical integration among its three business segments as well as the baa standalone quality of both its ep and ldc local distribution company operations” 

  

the company’s credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company’s ratings particularly below investment grade the company’s access to the capital markets may be limited borrowing costs and margin deposits would increase counterparties may request additional assurances and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease the required margin is subject to significant change as a result of other factors besides credit rating such as gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the company 

  

the company’s debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that if not complied with could require early payment additional collateral support or similar actions the most significant default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s current credit facility’s financial covenants require a total debttototal capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2008 the company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants 

  

  

commodity risk management 

  

the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company’s risk management program includes the use of exchangetraded natural gas futures contracts and options and otc natural gas swap agreements and options collectively derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes the derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are primarily fixed price swaps or collars 

  

the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s total hedge position for 2009 through 2011 are 

  

   

 the above price is based on a conversion rate of 105 mmbtumcf 

  

the company’s current hedged position provides price protection for greater than 65 of expected production in 2009 and 40 of expected production through 2011 the company’s earnings per share exposure to a 010 change in average nymex natural gas price is approximately 003 per diluted share for 2009 and ranges from 004 to 005 per diluted share per year for 2010 and 2011 the company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic business in 2005 the company agreed to maintain certain guarantees which benefit noresco these guarantees the majority of which predate the sale of noresco became offbalance sheet arrangements upon the closing of the sale of noresco these arrangements include guarantees of noresco’s obligations to the purchasers of certain of noresco’s contract receivables and agreements to maintain guarantees supporting noresco’s obligations under certain customer contracts in addition noresco and the purchaser agreed that noresco would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and that the purchaser or noresco would reimburse the company for losses under the guarantees the purchaser’s obligations to reimburse the company are capped at 6 million the total maximum potential obligation under these arrangements is estimated to be approximately 318 million as of december 31 2008 and decreases over time as the guarantees expire or the underlying obligations are fulfilled by noresco in 2008 the original purchaser of noresco sold its interest in noresco and transferred its obligations to a third party in connection with that event the new owner is expected to deliver to the company a 1 million letter of credit supporting its obligations the company determined that the likelihood the company will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

  

in november 1995 eqt through a subsidiary guaranteed a tax indemnification to the limited partners of appalachian basin partners lp abp for any tax losses resulting from a disallowance of the nonconventional fuels 

  

  

tax credits if certain representations and warranties of the company were not true the company guaranteed the tax indemnification until the tax statute of limitations closes the company does not have any recourse provisions with third parties or any collateral held by third parties associated with this guarantee that could be liquidated to recover amounts paid if any under the guarantee as of december 31 2008 the maximum amount of future payments the company could be required to make is estimated to be approximately 12 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of fin 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance additionally based on the status of the company’s irs examinations the company has determined that any potential loss from this guarantee is remote 

  

the company has a nonequity interest in a variable interest entity appalachian npi llc anpi in which eqt was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary thus anpi is not consolidated within the company’s consolidated financial statements in determining the primary beneficiary the company estimated the expected losses and expected residual returns of anpi under various scenarios in order to identify the party that would absorb the majority of the losses or benefit from the majority of the returns the primary assumptions utilized in the scenarios included commodity price and production volumes as of december 31 2008 anpi had 181 million of total assets and 227 million of total liabilities including 102 million of longterm debt including current maturities excluding minority interest anpi is financed primarily through cash provided by operating activities 

  

the company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to anpi which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the project’s future cash flows from the preceding yearend until the termination date of the agreement this liquidity reserve guarantee is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the appalachian natural gas trust angt the company received a marketbased fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee as of december 31 2008 the maximum amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately 22 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of fin 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance the terms of the anpi liquidity reserve guarantee require the company to provide a letter of credit in favor of anpi as security for the company’s obligations the amount of this letter of credit requirement at december 31 2008 was approximately 258 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee 

  

the company has entered into an agreement with angt to provide gathering and operating services to deliver angt’s gas to market in addition the company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered the revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately 159 million 158 million and 168 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s guarantees 

  

pension plans 

  

total pension expense recognized by the company in 2008 2007 and 2006 excluding special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses totaled 05 million 06 million and 01 million respectively the company recognized special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2008 2007 and 2006 of 94 million 14 million and 30 million respectively 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company settled its pension obligations under a plan covering employees of the former kentucky west virginia gas company llc an eqt subsidiary which merged into equitable gathering llc the former kentucky west virginia employees transferred to equitable gathering llc or equitable production company as a result of the settlement the company recognized pension settlement expense of approximately 8 million an additional 14 million of pension settlement losses were recognized in 2008 for lump sum payments made during the normal course of plan operations 

  

during 2007 the company recognized a settlem ent expense of 05 million due to a plan design change for a specific union and an additional settlement expense for 05 million due to the transfer of some current active employees to nonunion employment during the fourth quarter of 2006 the company recognized a settlement expense of approximately 27 million for an early retirement program 

  

  

the company made cash contributions to its pension plan of approximately 34 million 13 million and 18 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as a result of the previously described settlements under current law the company expects to make cash payments related to its pensions of approximately 15 million in 2009 which will meet the 80 funding obligations on its remaining plans pension contributions will be funded by cash flow from operations or by borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility 

  

rate regulation 

  

the company’s distribution operations transmission and storage operations and a portion of its gathering operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed accounting for the company’s regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 71 as described in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

the following table details the undiscounted future projected payments associated with the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 

  

   

purchase obligations primarily are for commitments for demand charges under existing longterm contracts with pipeline suppliers as well as under binding precedent agreements approximately 194 million of these obligations each year are believed to be recoverable in customer rates 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program in 2008 the company entered into an agreement with liberty avenue holdings llc to provide office space for the company’s new corporate headquarters the obligations for the company’s various office locations and warehouse buildings totaled approximately 1328 million as of december 31 2008 the company has agreements with highlands drilling llc highlands and patterson uti drilling company llc patterson for highlands and patterson to provide drilling equipment and services to the company these obligations totaled approximately 538 million as of december 31 2008 

  

the other liabilities line represents commitments for total estimated payouts for the 2007 supply longterm incentive program and the 2008 executive performance incentive program see section titled “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations the company adopted the 2009 shareholder value plan in december 2008 and the company may adopt other plans in the future the contractual obligations do not include any payments under the 2009 shareholder value plan or any potential future plans 

  

as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total fin 48 liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 of 476 million the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above 

  

  

contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

several west virginia lessors claimed in a suit filed on july 31 2006 that equitable production company had underpaid royalties on gas produced and marketed from leases the suit sought compensatory and punitive damages an accounting and other relief the plaintiffs later amended their complaint to name equitable resources inc as an additional defendant while the company believes that it paid the proper royalty it established a reserve to cover any potential liability the company has settled the litigation the settlement covers all of the company’s lessors in west virginia and is subject to court approval the company believes the reserve established for royalty matters is sufficient 

  

in the ordinary course of business various other legal claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company has established reserves for pending litigation which it believes are adequate and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position of the company 

  

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates   

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon eqt’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed and approved by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities under this method all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves if an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows pursuant to sfas no 19 the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit the depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred the company estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from its proved oil and gas properties and compares those future cash flows to the carrying values of the applicable properties the estimated future cash flows used to test properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset market prices for oil and gas and future operating costs proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable those properties would be written down to fair value which would be estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

  

capitalized costs of unproved properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on an aggregated prospect basis indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors potential 

  

  

shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience if it is determined that the properties will not yield proved reserves the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made unproved properties had a net book value of 835 million in 2008 there were no significant unproved properties balances at december 31 2007 or 2006 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which can be significantly impacted by assumed market prices for oil and gas should the company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves as defined by sec regulation sx rule 410 are the estimated quantities of crude oil natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions ie prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made

  

the company’s estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed annually using geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and reviewed by the company’s independent engineers revisions may result from changes in among other things reservoir performance prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the financial statements 

  

the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas and oil reserves based on selling prices and costs at yearend price levels operating costs production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation income tax expense is computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws and which relate to oil and gas producing activities 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from marktomarket hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss deferred revenues and expenses federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized the company also recorded a 02 million charge in 2008 and 01 million charge in 2007 and 2006 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain compensation plans as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under section 162m of the irc no other valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets any change in the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

  

the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes under the provisions of fin 48 this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the recognition threshold requires the company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in order to record any financial statement benefit if the first step is satisfied then the company must measure the tax position the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed and considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement 

  

derivative commodity instruments  the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production under sfas no 133 derivative instruments are required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge under sfas no 133 the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings see “commodity risk management” above and item 7a—“quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for additional information regarding hedging activities

  

the company estimates the fair value of all derivative instruments using quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon models that use as inputs marketbased parameters including but not limited to forward curves discount rates broker quotes volatilities and nonperformance risk nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company’s credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty’s credit standing on the fair value of assets the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company’s or counterparty’s credit rating and the yield of a risk free instrument and credit default swap rates where available the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results changes in market conditions or other factors many of which are beyond the company’s control

  

a substantial majority of the company’s derivative financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges should these instruments fail to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or be dedesignated the subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments would be recorded in earnings which could materially impact the results of operations one of the requirements for hedge accounting is that a derivative instrument be highly effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows of the transaction being hedged effectiveness is impacted by counterparty credit rating as it must be probable that the counterparty will perform in order for the hedge to be effective the 

  

  

company monitors counterparty credit quality by reviewing counterparty credit spreads credit ratings credit default swap rates and market activity 

  

in addition the derivative commodity instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk associated with future natural gas production may limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose the company to margin requirements given the company’s price risk management position and price volatility the company may be required from time to time to deposit cash with or provide letters of credit to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative commodity instruments are “critical accounting estimates” because t he company’s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to the volatility of natural gas prices changes in the effectiveness of cash flow hedge’s due to changes in estimates of nonperformance risk and by changes in margin requirements as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of 163 million and a liability of 4795 million respectively

  

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the recording of contingencies is guided by the principles of sfas no 5 the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

in addition to the obligation to record contingent liabilities sfas no 143 requires that the company accrue a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells t he fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company increases the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

share based compensation the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 longterm incentive plan the company accounts for all of its sharebased payment awards in accordance with sfas no 123r the company treats its executive performance incentive programs including the 2008 executive performance incentive program 2008 epip and the 2007 supply longterm incentive program 2007 supply program as liability awards the actual cost to be recorded for these plans will not be known until the measurement date requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized at each reporting date the company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts

  

approximately 70000 units were granted under the 2008 epip the payout of this program will be between zero and three times this number of units valued at the price of the company’s common stock at the end of the performance period december 31 2011 the payout multiple is dependent upon the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group’s total shareholder return and the downward discretion of the compensation 

  

  

committee of the board of directors the company granted approximately 165000 awards under the 2007 supply program the awards earned may be increased to a maximum of three times the initial award or reduced to zero based upon achievement of the predetermined production sales revenue targets the performance period for the 2007 supply program ends on december 31 2010 

  

assuming no change in the current payout multiple assumptions for both programs a 10 increase in the company’s stock price assumptions for the 2008 epip plan and the 2007 supply program would result in an increase in 2009 compensation expense under these plans of approximately 07 million 

  

the compensation committee of the board of directors adopted the 2009 shareholder value plan 2009 svp in december 2008 a total of 977600 units were granted under the plan the payout of this award will depend on a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group and the company’s average absolute return on total capital during the performance period of january 1 2005 to december 31 2009 payout of awards will be between zero and 250 the number of units awarded at the price of the company’s common stock at the end of the performance period december 31 2009 assuming a payout multiple of 175 and a 10 increase in the company’s yearend stock price the 2009 svp plan would result in compensation expense of approximately 77 million in 2009 

  

the 1999 longterm incentive plan permits the grant of restricted stock awards and nonqualified stock options to employees of the company for time restricted stock awards compensation expense which is based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the majority of the timebased restricted shares granted will vest at the end of the threeyear period commencing with the date of grant for nonqualified stock options compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is recognized in the company’s financial statements over the vesting period the company utilizes the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options which includes assumptions for a riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility factor and expected term the riskfree rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company’s stock expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company’s stock the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the company’s shares and the various performance factors the impact on net income of these changes can be material and management’s assumptions regarding these performance factors require significant judgment 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative commodity instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through the eqt production and eqt midstream segments the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k the company uses nonleveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

commodity price risk 

  

the following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10 increase and a 10 decrease in commodity prices 

  

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels the company holds an immaterial amount of derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes 

  

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company include futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity the company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy 

  

management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted due to the significant well development and infrastructure investment at eqt production and eqt midstream the company’s overall objective in its hedging program has been to ensure an adequate level of return for these investments to the extent that the company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price the company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2008 the company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2015 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 2104 bcf of natural gas see the “commodity risk management” in the “capital resources and liquidity” sections of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” item 7 of this form 10k for further discussion a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2008 levels would increase the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 549 million a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2008 levels would decrease the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 524 million 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal change in fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2008 the price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s balance sheet resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

other market risks 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the commodity futures trading 

  

  

commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from any potential financial instability of the exchange members the company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the company’s criteria for credit and liquidity strength and continually monitoring counterparty risk factors 

  

the company utilizes various information technology systems to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures this includes closely monitoring current market conditions counterparty credit spreads and credit default swap rates credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits to manage the level of credit risk the company enters transactions with financial counterparties that are of investment grade enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

approximately 52 or 1544 million of otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2008 have a positive fair value all derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2008 are with counterparties having an sp rating of a or above at that date 

  

in september 2008 the credit support provider of one counterparty lehman brothers declared bankruptcy resulting in a default under various derivative contracts with the company as a result those contracts were terminated and a reserve of 52 million was recorded against the entire balance due to the company there is no additional income statement exposure to lehman brothers beyond the reserve recorded this year as of december 31 2008 the company is not in default under any derivative contracts and has no knowledge of default by any other counterparty to derivative contracts the company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet 

  

the company is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable from eqt production are generated from the sale of produced natural gas to certain marketers including the company’s wholly owned marketing subsidiary equitable energy and utility and industrial customers located mainly in the appalachian area additionally a significant amount of revenues and related accounts receivable at eqt midstream are generated from the sale of produced natural gas liquids to a gas processor in kentucky and gathering of natural gas in kentucky virginia pennsylvania and west virginia 

  

the company has a 15 billion revolving credit facility that matures on october 26 2011 the credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of 15 financial institutions each of which is obligated to fund its prorata portion of any borrowings by the company lehman is one of the 15 financial institutions in the syndicate and has committed to make loans not exceeding 95 million under the facility lehman failed to fund its portion of all recent borrowings by the company which effectively reduces the total amount available under the facility to 1405 million as of december 31 2008 the company has outstanding under the facility 3199 million of loans in support of corporate activities and a 258 million irrevocable standby letter of credit 

  

no one lender in the syndicate holds more than 10 of the facility the company’s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to otherwise limit the company’s exposure if further problems or consolidation occur in the banking industry

  business segments 

  

equitable supply 

  

equitable supply’s production business develops produces and sells natural gas and to a limited extent crude oil and natural gas liquids in the appalachian region of the united states its gathering business consists of the gathering of gas produced by the company and third parties and the processing of natural gas liquids   equitable supply generated approximately 64 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2007 

  

production 

  

equitable supply’s production business operating through equitable production company and several other affiliates collectively referred to as “equitable production” is one of the largest owners of proved natural gas reserves in the appalachian basin equitable production’s key operating assets include 

  

·   1016960 gross 954010 net productive acres 

  

·   2286759 gross 2145175 net undeveloped acres 

  

·   total proved reserves at december 31 2007 of 2682 bcfe 65 of which were proved developed 

  

·   12889 gross 9309 net producing wells 

  

  the company’s proved reserves had discounted future net cash flows before income taxes of 3989 million 2473 million after tax at december 31 2007 this standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated using adjusted yearend prices in accordance with sfas no 69 see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for more information these reserves are located entirely in the appalachian basin which is characterized by wells with comparatively low rates of annual decline in production long lives low production costs and natural gas containing high energy content many of the company’s wells have been producing for decades in some cases since the early 1900’s management believes that virtually all of the company’s wells are low risk development wells because they are drilled in areas and into reservoirs which are known to be productive 

  

  the company is focused on continuing its significant organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program and believes that this plan will increase its proved reserves based on the quality of the underlying asset base from 2005 through 2007 equitable has drilled 997 wells on locations not classified as proved in the reserves report with less than 3 dry holes drilled the company has announced a significant capital commitment plan to support its reserve growth capital spending for well development primarily drilling is expected to increase to 619 million in 2008 from 298 million in 2007 a substantial portion of the company’s 2008 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in kentucky and west virginia the company is targeting completion of between 250 and 300 horizontal wells in 2008 and expects an average cost per horizontal well of approximately 12 million below its estimates when it began the horizontal drilling program in the latter part of 2006 the company expects average recovery results in the range of 075 bcfe to 150 bcfe per horizontal well 

  

the company drilled 634 gross wells 456 net in 2007 consisting of 88 horizontal shale wells 266 coal bed methane wells and 280 other vertical wells included in this total are 36 infill wells drilling was concentrated within equitable’s core areas of southwestern virginia southeastern kentucky and southern west virginia 

  

  

  

the company’s drilling activity resulted in proved developed reserve additions of approximately 165 bcfe in 2007 of the proved developed reserve additions approximately 43 bcfe related to proved undeveloped reserves that were transferred to proved developed reserves the company’s 2007 extensions discoveries and other additions of 3210 bcfe exceeded the 2007 production of 831 bcfe a drill bit reserves replacement ratio of 386 

  

  equitable supply’s production for 2007 increased to 831 bcfe yielding an a verage proved reservestoproduction ratio average reserve life of approximately 323 years at yearend 2007 when compared to the company’s yearend proved reserves of 2682 bcfe  equitable supply’s fourth quarter 2007 average daily sales were 210 mmcfe per day daily sales volumes are expected to reach 235 mmcfe by yearend 2008 with total production sales volumes expected to reach 8081 bcfe for the year 

  

  see note 24 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for information on reserves reserve activity costs and the standard measure of discounted future cash flows 

  

  the natural gas produced by equitable supply is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for gas located in the appalachian basin is generally higher than the price for gas located in the gulf coast largely due to the differential in the cost to transport gas to customers in the northeastern united states the recent increase in production in the appalachian basin by the company and other producers is putting pressure on the capacity of existing gathering and midstream processing and transport systems as a result the company has entered into certain discounted sales arrangements to obtain transportation capacity so that its gas continues to flow 

  

the combination of longlived production low drilling costs high drilling completion rates and proximity to natural gas markets has resulted in a highly fragmented operating environment in the appalachian basin natural gas drilling activity has increased as suppliers in the appalachian basin attempt to take advantage of natural gas prices which continue to be higher than historical levels while increased activity can place constraints on availability of labor equipment pipeline transport and other resources in the appalachian basin it also provides opportunities for expansion of natural gas gathering activities and potential to attract higher quality rigs and labor providers in the future 

  

equitable supply hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production it also hedges third party purchases and sales the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

gathering 

  

equitable gathering operating through several subsidiaries of the company derives its revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin as of december 31 2007 the system included approximately 7500 miles of gathering lines located throughout west virginia eastern kentucky and southwestern virginia over 90 of the gathering system volumes are transported to interconnects with three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans lp equitrans the company’s interstate pipeline affiliate maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to geographically diverse markets 

  

gathering system sales volumes for 2007 totaled 942 bcfe of which approximately 65 related to the gathering of equitable production’s gas volumes 24 related to third party volumes and the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company continued to operate for a fee approximately 84 of equitable gathering’s 2007 revenues were from affiliates as a result of the gathering asset contribution to nora gathering llc in 2007 discussed in note 4 to the company’s consolidated financial statements operations related to the nora area gathering activities are no longer included in equitable gathering’s operating results equitable gathering records its 50 equity interest in the earnings of nora gathering llc under the equity method of accounting 

  

  

  

key competitors for new gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated appalachian energy companies see “outlook” under equitable supply’s section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for discussion of the company’s strategy in regard to its midstream gathering operations 

  

equitable utilities 

  

  equitable utilities’ operations comprise gathering transportation storage distribution and marketing of natural gas equitable utilities has both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated activities consist of the company’s stateregulated distribution operations and federallyregulated pipeline and storage operations the nonregulated activities include the nonregulated pipeline operations nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas risk management activities for the company and the sale of energyrelated products and services equitable utilities generated approximately 36 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2007 

  

  distribution operations 

  

  equitable utilities’ distribution operations are carried out by equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory for the distribution operations includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia these areas have a rather static population and economy the distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 275000 customers consisting of 256400 residential customers and 18600 commercial and industrial customers equitable gas purchases gas through contracts with various sources including major and independent producers in the gulf coast local producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate these contracts contain various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices 

  

  equitable gas’ distribution rates terms of service and contracts with affiliates are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the wv psc and the issuance of securities is subject to regulation by the pa puc  the field line sales rates in kentucky are also subject to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania which is not subject to comprehensive regulation 

  

  the company must usually seek approval of one or more of its regulators prior to increasing or decreasing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and transportation activities it is allowed to recover a return in addition to the costs of its transportation activities however the company’s regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term equitable gas has worked with and continues to work with regulators to implement alternative cost recovery programs equitable gas’ tariffs for commercial and industrial customers allow for negotiated rates in limited circumstances regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company is not aware of any significant noncompliance as a result of any completed audits 

  

  because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 72 of calendar year 2007 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during the offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

  

  pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist low income customers with paying their gas bills the costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers equitable gas has several such programs including the cap in october 2006 equitable gas submitted a request for pa puc approval to increase funding to support the increasing costs of its cap on september 27 2007 the pa puc issued an order approving an increase to equitable’s surcharge which is designed to offset the costs of the cap the revised surcharge went into effect on october 2 2007 see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for more information 

  

  on march 1 2006 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire dominion’s natural gas distribution assets in pennsylvania and in west virginia for approximately 970 million subject to adjustments in a 

  

  

  

cash transaction for the stock of peoples and hope in light of the continued delay in achieving the final legal approvals for this transaction the company and dominion agreed to terminate the definitive agreement pursuant to a mutual termination agreement entered into on january 15 2008 see item 3 “legal proceedings” for a description of proceedings initiated by the federal trade commission for the purpose of challenging the proposed acquisition 

  

  pipeline transportation and storage operations 

  

  equitable utilities’ interstate pipeline operations are carried out by equitrans these operations offer gas gathering transportation storage and related services to affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and ugi energy services inc in 2007 approximately 66 of transportation volumes and approximately 77 of transportation revenues were from affiliates equitrans’ rates are subject to regulation by the ferc 

  

  in the second quarter of 2006 the company filed a certificate application with the ferc for approval to build a 70mile 20inch diameter pipeline which will connect the companyoperated kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant in langley kentucky to the tennessee gas pipeline in carter county kentucky and will initially provide up to 130000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service the pipeline known as the big sandy pipeline is owned and will be operated by equitrans on october 16 2007 the ferc granted equitrans’ request for an extension of time until march 31 2008 to complete construction of the big sandy pipeline capital expenditures incurred by the company related to the big sandy pipeline are included in the equitable supply business segment 

  

  on april 5 2006 the ferc approved a settlement to equitrans’ consolidated 2005 and 2004 rate case filings the settlement became effective on june 1 2006 this settlement allows equitrans to institute an annual surcharge for the tracking and recovery of all costs operations maintenance and return on invested capital incurred on and after september 1 2005 related to equitrans’ pipeline safety program under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 filings to modify the surcharge must be made on or before march 1st of each year for approval by the ferc on march 29 2007 the company received approval subject to refund to institute the surcharge and on april 1 2007 the company commenced billing the surcharge on november 26 2007 the ferc removed the refund condition and approved the surcharge effective april 1 2007 the company anticipates that additional filings to modify the surcharge will continue to be made in future years to recover costs incurred in connection with its pipeline safety program 

  

  equitrans’ firm transportation contracts on its mainline system expire between 2009 and 2011 and the firm transportation contracts on its big sandy pipeline expire in 2018 the company anticipates that the capacity associated with these expiring contracts will be remarketed such that the capacity will remain fully subscribed

 item 1a risk factors   risks relating to our business 

  

  in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 

  

  natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability and liquidity 

  

  our revenue profitability and liquidity depend on the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the proximity to and availability of capacity on transportation facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation royalties and price controls 

  

  increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap agreements and exchange traded instruments which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in such cases we are however exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties of their obligations under the derivative contracts in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from the increase in the price of natural gas 

  

lower natural gas prices may result in downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves and cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings in addition our reserves may be impacted by increases in our estimates of development costs or changes to our production assumptions which may change our production plans or may result in downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and cause us to incur noncash charges to earnings 

  

  our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

  

  our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect 

  

  the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

  our future success depends on our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to maximize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings we have expanded our drilling program in recent years and have announced plans to drill up to 750 wells in 2008 including a target of 250 to 300 horizontal wells our drilling of development wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing and cost overruns and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs and 

  

  

a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit additionally a failure to effectively operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections without continued successful development or acquisition activities together with effective operation of existing wells our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

  our failure to develop and maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

  

  our gas delivery depends on the availability of adequate transportation infrastructure as we previously announced 568 million of our 2008 capital commitment budget is planned for investment in midstream infrastructure which we expect will include significant new investment in transportation infrastructure as well as our continuing investment in the big sandy pipeline and the langley hydrocarbon processing plant investment in midstream infrastructure is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing gathering and transportation pipelines as well as processing adjacent to and curtailments on such pipelines  our infrastructure development program can involve significant risks including those related to timing and cost overruns and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and qualified contractors and work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology compliance by third parties with their contractual obligations to us and other factors we also deliver to and are served by third party gas gathering transportation processing and storage facilities which are limited in number and geographically concentrated an extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities could result in material adverse consequences to us 

  

  volatility in the capital markets or downgrades to our credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing adversely affecting our business results of operations and liquidity 

  

we rely on access to both shortterm bank and money markets and longerterm capital markets as a source of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations market disruptions or any downgrade of our credit rating may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other borrowing arrangements which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity these disruptions could include an economic downturn changes in capital market conditions generally and deterioration in the overall health of our industry 

  

we cannot be sure that our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency an increase in the level of our indebtedness in the future may result in a downgrade in the ratings that are assigned to our debt any downgrade in our rating could result in an increase in our borrowing costs which would diminish financial results 

  

  we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells pipelines and facilities 

  

  our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation storage and distribution of natural gas these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage as a result we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 

  

  our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

  significant portions of our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are subject to state and federal regulation including regulation of the rates which we may assess our customers the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost 

  

  

recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills without the ability to recover some or all of the additional assistance in rates 

  

  we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety complying with these requirements could have a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position if we fail to comply with these requirements even if caused by factors beyond our control such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us  

  

  the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by equitable supply which often fluctuate could be increased by the various taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

equitable’s consolidated income from continuing operations for 2007 was 2575 million or 210 per diluted share compared with 2160 million or 177 per diluted share for 2006 and 2586 million or 209 per diluted share for 2005 

  

the 415 million increase in income from continuing operations from 2006 to 2007 resulted from several factors including the 2007 pretax gain of 1261 million on the sale of assets in the nora area and a 170 million increase in production revenues at equitable supply at equitable utilities increases in marketing revenues due to favorable storage asset optimization opportunities that were captured at a time of unusually high commodity price volatility which settled in the first quarter of 2007 and increases in distribution revenues due to colder weather in equitable gas’s service territory contributed to the increase in income from continuing operations over 2006 

  

the increases in revenue between years were partially offset by a 462 million increase in incentive compensation expense the 101 million writeoff of deferred transaction costs related to the termination of the proposed acquisition of peoples and hope and 97 million in higher depletion depreciation and amortization primarily at equitable supply in addition higher labor costs and charges for certain legal reserves settlements and related expenses partially offset the increases in income from continuing operations 

  

the 426 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2006 included the impact of several factors in 2005 the company recognized a pretax gain of 1103 million on the sale of kerrmcgee corporation kerrmcgee shares in 2006 the company incurred 123 million of transition planning expenses relating to the now terminated acquisition of peoples and hope the company also recorded a reserve for certain legal disputes the impact of lower realized selling prices 258 million and warmer weather 93 million also contributed to the decrease between years 

  

these unfavorable effects on income from continuing operations between 2005 and 2006 were partially offset by 2005 charges of 160 million for the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and of 78 million for the company’s office consolidation as well as the 2006 favorable impact of the equitrans rate case settlement additionally income from continuing operations for 2006 was positively impacted by reduced expenses related to the executive performance incentive programs 227 million favorable storage asset optimization 164 million and higher production sales volumes 116 million 

  

  the company’s effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2007 was 359 compared to 337 for the year ended december 31 2006 and 372 for the year ended december 31 2005 the higher effective tax rate in 2007 is the result of several factors including a change in the west virginia state tax law and a reduced 2006 rate resulting from the release of state valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryovers the higher effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily the result of tax benefit disallowances under section 162m of the irc see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive costs pension costs and administrative costs totaling 653 million 219 million and 480 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively were not allocated to business segments the higher unallocated expenses in 2007 and 2005 compared to 2006 primarily relate to lower longterm incentive expenses in 2006 

  

the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income to the company’s consolidated operating income equity in earnings of

equitable supply 

  

overview 

  

equitable supply is focused on organic reserve and production growth through its drilling program the company drilled 634 gross wells 456 net wells in 2007 including 88 horizontal shale wells p roved reserves increased 165 bcfe 7 to 2682 bcfe during the year 

  

equitable supply’s revenues for 2007 increased 3 compared to 2006 revenues despite a 037 decrease in the average nymex price in 2007 the average wellhead sales price increased 3 as a result of a less unfavorable hedge impact compared to 2006 and favorable liquids prices sales volumes increased more than 5 from 2006 excluding volumes from properties sold during 2007 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2007 and 2006 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s producing wells 

  

operating expenses at equitable supply increased 9 primarily due to charges for legal reserves settlements and related expenses as well as higher depletion resulting from increased drilling investments as the company continues to expand its development in the appalachian basin 

  

during 2007 the equitable supply segment sold to pine mountain oil and gas inc pmog a subsidiary of range resources corporation range a portion of the company’s interests in certain gas properties in the nora area totaling approximately 74 bcf of proved reserves also during 2007 the equitable supply segment contributed certain nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to nora gathering llc a newly formed entity that is equally owned by the company and pmog in exchange for a 50 equity interest in the llc and cash these transactions resulted in a net gain of 1261 million see note 4 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions as a result of the gathering asset contribution gathered volumes gathering revenues and gatheringrelated expenses related to the nora area gathering activities are no longer included in equitable supply’s operating results however equitable supply records its 50 equity interest in the earnings of nora gathering llc in equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments 

  

the company is working to obtain the third party consents required to complete the transaction on a portion of the property not included in the 2007 closing a final closing covering the remainder of the gas properties and related remaining gathering assets included in the above transactions would reduce the company’s proved reserves by a maximum of approximately 9 bcf 

  

during the third quarter of 2007 the equitable supply segment purchased an additional working interest of approximately 135 in certain gas properties in the roaring fork area totaling approximately 123 bcf of proved reserves and certain gathering assets from the minority interest holders see note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction 

  

  

results of operations 

  

   

  

   

a   natural gas and oil production represents the company’s interest in gas and oil production measured at the wellhead it is equal to the sum of total sales volumes company usage line loss and natural gas inventory usage net 

  

b   2007 capital expenditures include 281 for the acquisition of working interests in wells in the roaring fork area and 2005 capital expenditures include 575 million for the acquisition of the limited partnership interest in eastern seven partners lp esp 

  

c   revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect process and deliver natural gas from the field to the trunk or main transmission line many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price in which case the company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components 

  

d   production taxes include severance and productionrelated ad valorem and other property taxes 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2007 vs december 31 2006 

  

equitable supply’s operating income totaled 2635 million for 2007 compared to 2692 million for 2006 a decrease of approximately 56 million between years gathering operating income decreased 52 million due to a decrease in gathered volumes partially offset by an increase in the average gathering fee production operating income decreased 04 million primarily due to an increase in production operating expenses partially offset by an increase in average wellhead sales price and increased sales volumes 

  

total operating revenues were 5017 million for 2007 compared to 4886 million for 2006 the 131 million increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to a 3 increase in the average wellhead sales price and a 1 increase in production total sales volumes partially offset by a 4 decrease in gathering revenues the 015 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price was mainly attributable to a higher percentage of 

  

  

unhedged gas sales a higher realized hedge price and a higher liquids price the 1 increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the 2007 and 2006 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells and the 2007 sale to pmog of interests which provided sales of 3044 mmcfe during 2006 the 4 decrease in gathering revenues was attributable to a 13 decline in gathered volumes partially offset by a 12 increase in the average gathering fee the decrease in gathered volumes is primarily the result of a reduction in volumes gathered for company production due to the contribution of gathering facilities and pipelines to nora gathering llc partially offset by increased company production the increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the company’s commitment to ensuring that this fee is sufficient to cover increasing operating costs 

  

operating expenses totaled 2381 million for 2007 compared to 2194 million for 2006 the 187 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 95 million in sga 94 million in dda and 15 million in loe excluding production taxes partially offset by a decrease of 17 million in production taxes the increase in sga was primarily due to increased legal reserves settlements and related expenses in 2007 compared to the reduction of certain liability reserves in 2006 partially offset by a 2006 increase to the reserve established for uncollectible accounts the increase in dda was primarily due to increased depletion expense resulting from both increases in the unit rate 69 million and volume 10 million as well as increased depreciation on a higher asset base 15 million the 008 increase in the depletion rate is primarily attributable to the increased investment in oil and gas producing properties the increase in loe excluding production taxes was attributable to personnel costs environmental costs and liability insurance costs the decrease in production taxes was primarily due to a decrease in severance taxes arising out of the sale of assets in the nora area gathering and compression expense remained flat year over year as increased expense in 2007 for the company’s remaining gathering facilities was mostly offset by decreased expenses relating to the gathering asset contribution to nora gathering llc and a 33 million pension and other postretirement benefits charge for an early retirement program in the fourth quarter of 2006 the increased gathering and compression expense at the remaining facilities was primarily due to increased electricity charges on newly installed electric compressors increased field line and compressor maintenance related to the company’s infrastructure investments increased field labor and related employment costs and increased compliance costs the per unit gathering and compression rate increased as the per unit rate for the nora area properties contributed in 2007 was significantly lower than the rate for the company’s remaining properties 

  

equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments totaled 29 million for 2007 compared to equity earnings of 01 million for 2006 the 28 million increase was primarily due to equity earnings of 26 million recorded in 2007 for equitable supply’s investment in nora gathering llc 

  

other income represents afudcequity for the construction of the fercregulated big sandy pipeline the 57 million increase from 2006 to 2007 is the result of increased capital spending for this infrastructure project 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2006 vs december 31 2005 

  

equitable supply’s operating income totaled 2692 million for 2006 compared to 2936 million for 2005 a decrease of 244 million between years production operating income decreased 291 million primarily due to a decrease in wellhead sales price and an increase in production operating expenses partially offset by increased sales volumes gathering operating income increased 47 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses 

  

total operating revenues were 4886 million for 2006 compared to 4892 million for 2005 the 06 million decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a 7 per mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price partially offset by a 3 increase in production total sales volumes and a 12 increase in gathering revenues the 034 per mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price was mainly attributable to decreased market prices on unhedged volumes and increased gathering charges partially offset by the absence of a 2005 negative price adjustment and increased prices on hedged volumes the 2005 price adjustment was principally due to the company’s conclusion that the wellhead sales price allocated to a third party’s working interest gas in previous periods may have been lower than the company was obligated to pay   the 3 increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the 2006 and 2005 drilling programs partially offset by the sale of certain noncore gas properties in 2005 and the normal production decline in the company’s wells the 12 increase in 

  

  

gathering revenues was attributable to a 24 increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by a 10 decline in gathered volumes the increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the company’s commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases the average gathering fee was also positively impacted by the transfer of certain regulated gathering facilities to equitable utilities the decrease in gathered volumes in 2006 was primarily due to this transfer the sale of gathering assets in 2005 and thirdparty customer volume shutins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines these factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for company production in 2006 

  

operating expenses totaled 2194 million for 2006 compared to 1956 million for 2005 the 238 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 92 million in sga 78 million in gathering and compression 56 million in dda 14 million in loe excluding production taxes and 04 million in production taxes the increase in sga was the result of reserves established in connection with certain legal disputes and bad debt expenses the increase in gathering and compression was primarily due to the 33 million pension and other postretirement benefits charges increased compressor station operation and repair costs including electricity on newly installed compressors increased property taxes and increased field labor and related employment costs these factors were partially offset by the transfer of gathering facilities to equitable utilities and the sale of gathering assets in 2005 the increase in dda was due to a 003 per mcf increase in the unit depletion rate 20 million increased depreciation on a higher asset base 20 million and increased produced volumes 16 million the increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base the increase in loe excluding production taxes was primarily due to increased direct well expenses and well and location repairs and maintenance partially offset by the sale of gas properties in 2005 the increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes 24 million partially offset by decreased severance taxes 20 million the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the company’s wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes the decrease in severance taxes a production tax directly imposed on the value of gas extracted was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes the impairment charges in 2005 were related to the company’s relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations to its new consolidated office space 

  

see “capital resources and liquidity” section for discussion of equitable supply’s capital expenditures during 2007 2006 and 2005 

  

outlook 

  

equitable supply’s business strategy is focused on organic growth of the company’s natural gas reserves the most significant challenge facing the company and other producers in the appalachian basin is the availability of the pipeline infrastructure required to transport produced natural gas from the well to market as the company continues to expand the development of its reserves primarily through horizontal drilling the need for such infrastructure is increasingly important key elements of equitable supply’s strategy include 

  

·   expanding reserves and production through horizontal drilling in kentucky and west virginia the company’s capital commitments budget for 2008 includes 536 million for well development through this capital program the company will seek to maximize the value of its existing asset base by developing its large acreage position which the company believes holds significant production and reserve growth potential a substantial portion of the company’s 2008 drilling efforts will be focused on drilling horizontal wells in shale formations in kentucky and west virginia 

  

·   exploiting additional reserve potential through key emerging development plays in 2008 the company will examine the potential for exploitation of gas reserves in new geological formations and through different technologies plans include reentry wells in the devonian shale testing the devonian shale in virginia and high and low pressure marcellus shale wells in addition the company will obtain proprietary seismic data in order to evaluate deep drilling opportunities for 2009 approximately 15 of wells drilled in 2008 are expected to be located in these emerging development plays in the appalachian basin 

  

  

·   investing in midstream transportation gathering and processing in the appalachian basin   the company’s investment in midstream infrastructure is focused on its transportation gathering and processing capacity including completion of the big sandy pipeline and the langley processing facility infrastructure investment will help mitigate curtailments and increase the flexibility and reliability of the company’s gathering systems in transporting gas to market the company has adopted a “pipedriven” business model whereby production growth will occur in conjunction with the completion of a series of pipeline and compression projects known as “corridors” a corridor will represent a large area of acreage typically inclusive of a thousand or more well sites that requires investment in new pipeline and compression each corridor will radiate out from a central processing facility such as the company’s langley facility which will then connect to larger pipes such as the big sandy pipeline that transport gas to interstate markets 

  

equitable utilities 

  

overview 

  

equitable utilities’ net operating revenues increased 4 from 2006 to 2007 this increase was primarily due to favorable storage asset optimization at energy marketing and colder weather in equitable gas’s service territory in 2007 partially offset by a reduction in the pipeline operations net revenues due to a favorable adjustment in 2006 for the settlement of the equitrans rate case the marketing business is primarily driven by the optimization of the company’s physical and contractual gas storage assets which allow the segment to purchase gas and store it in lower price markets and simultaneously enter into contracts to sell it later at higher prices taking advantage of near term seasonal gas price spreads those spreads are unpredictable and at times were wider for transactions settled in 2007 than they were for contracts which settled in 2006 increases in net operating revenues were offset by increases in t otal operating expenses in 2007 of 220 million or 15 primarily due to the writeoff of peoples and hope acquisitionrelated costs that were previously deferred higher corporate allocations and increased compensation expense 

  

the weather in equitable gas’ service territory in 2007 was 7 colder than 2006 but 9 warmer than the 30year national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa average for the company’s service territory the weather in 2006 was 15 warmer than the 30year average 

  

pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist low income customers with paying their gas bills the costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers equitable gas has several such programs including the cap in october 2006 equitable gas submitted a request for pa puc approval to increase funding to support the increasing costs of its cap on september 27 2007 the pa puc issued an order approving an increase to equitable’s surcharge which is designed to offset the costs of cap the revised surcharge went into effect on october 2 2007 

  

on april 5 2006 equitrans entered into a settlement with the ferc that allows equitrans to institute an annual surcharge for the tracking and recovery of all costs operations maintenance and return on invested capital incurred on and after september 1 2005 related to equitrans’ pipeline safety program under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 filings to modify the surcharge must be made on or before march 1st of each year for approval by the ferc on march 29 2007 the company received approval subject to refund to institute the surcharge and on april 1 2007 the company commenced billing the surcharge on november 26 2007 the ferc removed the refund condition and approved the surcharge effective april 1 2007 as a result of the ferc order in 2007 equitrans recognized 12 million in deferred revenue as well as 07 million in pipeline integrity and safety maintenance costs that were deferred pending receipt of the final ferc order the company anticipates that additional filings to modify the surcharge will continue to be made in future years to recover costs incurred in connection with its pipeline safety program 

  

on march 1 2006 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire dominion’s natural gas distribution assets in pennsylvania and in west virginia for approximately 970 million subject to adjustments in a cash transaction for the stock of peoples and hope in light of the continued delay in achieving the final legal approvals for this transaction the company and dominion agreed to terminate the definitive agreement 

  

  

pursuant to a mutual termination agreement entered into on january 15 2008 as a result in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company recognized a charge of 101 million for acquisition costs that were previously deferred proceedings were initiated by the federal trade commission for the purpose of challenging the company’s proposed acquisition of peoples see item 3 “legal proceedings” for a description of these proceedings 

  

results of operations 

  

   

  

   

fiscal year ended december 31 2007 vs december 31 2006 

  

equitable utilities’ operating income totaled 1134 million for 2007 compared to 1252 million for 2006 an increase in net operating revenues was more than offset by increased operating expenses increased operating expenses were primarily related to the fourth quarter of 2007 writeoff of deferred acquisition costs that resulted from the termination of the agreement to acquire peoples and hope the 2007 operating income was also lower due to the following 2006 favorable nonrecurring items settlement of the equitrans rate case for the pipeline operations and a gain from the partial reversal of a 2005 impairment charge in connection with the company’s office consolidation 

  

net operating revenues were 2853 million for 2007 compared to 2750 million for 2006 the 103 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased energy marketing net operating revenues and increased distribution residential net operating revenues partially offset by a reduction in pipeline net operating revenues the 89 million increase in marketing net operating revenues was a result of storage asset optimization realized as the energy marketing operations used contractual storage capacity to capture unusually high summertowinter price spreads these price spreads were captured at a time of high volatility and the transactions settled in 2007 distribution net operating revenues increased by 65 million as a result of weather that was 7 colder than the prior year resulting in a 2480 mmcf increase in residential sales and transportation volumes from 2006 to 2007 commercial and industrial volumes increased 2130 mmcf from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to an increase in usage by one industrial customer these high volume industrial sales have very low margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues the pipeline net operating revenues declined by 51 million in 2007 primarily attributable to a onetime positive effect of the equitrans rate case settlement of 70 million in 2006 this reduction in net operating revenues was partially offset by equitrans’ pipeline safety surcharge that was formally approved by the ferc in november 2007 and increased firm transportation activities year over year 

  

  

operating expenses totaled 1718 million for 2007 compared to 1498 million for 2006 operating expenses for 2007 included a 101 million writeoff of costs previously deferred related to the now terminated agreement to acquire peoples and hope while 2006 included a onetime benefit of 24 million from the partial reversal of the 2005 impairment charge other increases in sga expense included higher corporate overhead allocations higher incentive compensation costs increased labor costs including information technology enhancements and costs associated with a customer experience study of the equitable gas customers these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense as a result of the continued organizational focus on collections and a reduction in delinquent accounts receivable and net writeoffs om expense increased 29 million as a result of increased maintenance activities and fleetrelated costs at the distribution and pipeline operations the 2007 pipeline om expense also included the recognition of 09 million of pipeline safety costs that were deferred pending the ferc order on the equitrans pipeline safety surcharge 

  

other income represents afudcequity and the increase over 2006 is primarily a result of increased capital spending on pipeline safety and integrity projects 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2006 vs december 31 2005 

  

equitable utilities’ operating income totaled 1252 million for 2006 compared to 983 million for 2005 equitable utilities’ operating income increased 269 million primarily due to increased net marketing revenues lower expenses related to defined benefit pension plans increased pipeline operating income reduction in bad debt expense an impairment charge in 2005 in connection with the company’s office consolidation and a gain in 2006 as a result of the partial reversal of the 2005 office impairment charge these improvements were partially offset by the impact of transition planning costs incurred for the now terminated agreement to acquire peoples and hope and a reduction in distribution net operating revenues due to weather 15 warmer than the 30year average 

  

net operating revenues were 2750 million for 2006 compared to 2534 million for 2005 the 216 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased pipeline and marketing net operating revenues partially offset by lower distribution net operating revenues pipeline operations’ net operating revenues increased 188 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the settlement of equitrans’ 2004 and 2005 ferc rate case and the implementation of new rates and contracts in connection with that settlement   the settlement’s approval which occurred in april 2006 improved net operating revenues by 70 million related to years 2005 and prior in addition new contract rates and billing determinants in the settlement resulted in a 61 million increase the transfer of certain gathering assets from equitable supply resulted in the remaining 57 million increase the increase in marketing net operating revenues of 164 million resulted primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in the volatile natural gas commodity price environment distribution operations’ net operating revenues decreased 135 million primarily due to a 3666 mmcf decrease in residential sales and transportation volumes resulting from warmer weather 

  

operating expenses totaled 1498 million for 2006 compared to 1551 million for 2005 operating expenses for 2005 included 160 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a 38 million loss related to the office impairment in connection with the company’s relocation into its new consolidated office space operating expenses for 2006 include 123 million of transition planning costs incurred for the now terminated agreement to acquire peoples and hope a 29 million increase in gathering expenses as a result of the transfer of certain assets from equitable supply the recognition of 46 million of previously deferred postretirement benefit obligation expenses in the pipeline business in connection with the ferc rate case settlement and the reversal of 24 million of the 2005 office impairment charge excluding these items operating expenses decreased 29 million which was primarily a result of decreases in distribution and marketing bad debt expense totaling 52 million offset by increases of 09 million in depreciation expense and 08 million in general liability insurance expenses the improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of nonpaying customers improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process the increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in equitable utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices

other income statement items 

  

   

during 2007 the equitable supply segment sold to pine mountain oil and gas inc pmog a portion of the company’s interests in certain gas properties in the nora area totaling approximately 74 bcf of proved reserves also during 2007 the equitable supply segment contributed certain nora area gathering facilities and pipelines to nora gathering llc in exchange for a 50 equity interest in nora gathering llc and cash these transactions resulted in a net gain of 1261 million see note 4 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 

  

as discussed in note 9 to the company’s consolidated financial statements in 2007 the company reviewed its investment portfolio including its investment allocation and sold equity funds with a cost basis of 63 million for total proceeds of 73 million resulting in the company recognizing a gain of 10 million during 2005 the company sold its remaining 70 million kerrmcgee shares resulting in pretax gains net of collar termination costs totaling 1103 million 

  

in 2007 and 2006 other income primarily relates to the equity portion of afudc prior to 2007 the amount of afudc — equity was not significant and was included as an offset to interest expense in the statements of consolidated income as a result of the significance of the carrying costs related to the big sandy pipeline and other regulated projects afudc — equity has been reclassified to other income in the statements of consolidated income for all periods presented other income in 2005 includes pretax dividend income of 12 million relating to the kerrmcgee shares held by the company in that year 

  

  

the company’s noresco business is classified as discontinued operations due to the sale of the noresco domestic business in 2005 and sale of the company’s remaining international investment in early 2006 income from discontinued operations for 2006 included a tax benefit of 32 million due to a reduced tax liability on the sale of the domestic business and aftertax income of 11 million resulting from the company’s reassessment of its remaining obligations for costs incurred related to the sale of the domestic business income from discontinued operations for 2005 included the reversal of approximately 78 million of reserves after tax established in 2004 due to improved business conditions in the related international markets as well as a 64 million tax benefit from the reorganization of the company’s international assets in 2005 these 2005 income items were partially offset by 187 million in aftertax charges recorded in 2005 related to the recording of 137 million of income taxes on the sale and other costs incurred as a result of the sale of the domestic noresco business 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense decreased by 08 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of the repayment of longterm debt a 12 increase in the average annual shortterm interest rate was more than offset by an overall reduction in weighted average net shortterm debt outstanding in part due to the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year 

  

interest expense increased by 37 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to a full year of interest expense in 2006 from the issuance of 150 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5 on september 30 2005 and an increase in the average annual shortterm debt interest rate partially offset by lower average shortterm debt during 2006 

  

average annual interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt were 58 46 and 35 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

operating activities 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 4267 million for 2007 as compared to 6178 million for 2006 a net decrease of 1911 million in cash flows provided by operating activities between years the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following 

  

·   a 59 million increase in cash required for margin deposits on the company’s natural gas hedge agreements in 2007 compared to a 3178 million decrease in cash required for margin deposits in 2006 the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to significantly higher than normal gas prices in 2005 which resulted in increased deposit remittances in that year 

  

·   a decrease in accounts receivable of 25 million in 2007 compared to a decrease in accounts receivable of 635 million in 2006 the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005 

  

partially offset by 

  

·   an increase in other current liabilities of 994 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of 319 million in 2006 primarily related to longterm incentive compensation plans and the timing of payments 

  

·   an increase in accounts payable of 659 million in 2007 compared to a decrease of 293 million in 2006 the increase in accounts payable in 2007 was primarily the result of increased capital spending while the decrease in 2006 was primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 

  

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 6178 million for 2006 as compared to 3123 million of cash flows used in operating activities for 2005 a net increase of 9301 in cash flows provided by operating activities between years the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following 

  

·   a 5987 million net reduction in cash required for margin deposit requirements on the company’s natural gas hedge agreements primarily due to significantly higher than normal gas prices in 2005 which resulted in increased deposit remittances in that year 

  

·   a decrease in tax payments to 586 million in 2006 from 2515 million in 2005 primarily due to taxes paid in 2005 related to the sale of the company’s kerrmcgee shares the sale of the noresco discontinued operations and the sale of noncore gas properties for significant taxable gains all in 2005 

  

·   a decrease in accounts receivable of 635 million in 2006 compared to an increase of 780 million in 2005 primarily due to decreased natural gas prices during 2006 as compared to significant increases in prices in 2005 

  

·   a decrease in inventory of 208 million during 2006 as compared to an increase of 853 million in 2005 primarily due to higher natural gas prices on volumes stored in 2005 compared to 2006

capital commitments and expenditures 

  

the company forecasts approximately 12 billion of capital commitments for 2008 this forecast includes 536 million for well development 568 million for midstream infrastructure at equitable supply 80 million for midstream projects at equitable utilities and 37 million for distribution infrastructure projects over 50 of the capital commitments in 2008 are for drilling and infrastructure in kentucky a portion of these capital commitments is not expected to impact cash flow until 2009 and beyond 

  

capital expenditures 

  

   

 the forecasted 2008 capital expenditures include 2007 capital commitments totaling 422 million including 234 million for equitable supply infrastructure 155 million for well development and 33 million for equitable utilities 

  

 includes 281 million related to the company’s purchase of an additional working interest of approximately 135 in the roaring fork area in virginia and certain gathering assets from a minority interest holder see note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

 includes 575 million for the acquisition of the 99 limited partnership interest in eastern seven partners lp see note 5 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

capital expenditures for well development and equitable supply infrastructure increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increased drilling and development program in 2007 capital expended for construction of the big sandy pipeline upgrades to the langley plant and other throughput optimization projects capital expenditures for well development and equitable supply infrastructure increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increased drilling and development program in 2006 capital expended for construction of the big sandy pipeline and other throughput optimization projects 

  

  

capital expenditures for equitable utilities increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased transmission pipeline replacement associated with pipeline integrity under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 and increased gathering infrastructure expenditures these same projects caused capital expenditures for equitable utilities to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 

  

the company’s forecasted 2008 capital expenditures represent a significant increase over capital expenditures in 2007 the 619 million targeted for well development in 2008 represents a 321 million increase over 2007 which is driven by expected increased drilling activity of up to 750 wells in 2008 compared to 634 wells in 2007 the ultimate number of wells drilled will depend on the mix of horizontal shale wells vertical conventional wells in sandstone and shale and coal bed methane wells the company plans to drill between 250 and 300 horizontal wells in 2008 with the intent to drill more if efficiency improvements experienced in 2007 continue the 490 million forecast for 2008 equitable supply infrastructure includes incremental appalachian midstream infrastructure to move new gas volumes to market including approximately 60000 horsepower of compression and approximately 400 miles of gathering lines the 107 million forecasted for equitable utilities includes 70 million for midstream projects and 37 million for distribution infrastructure projects the midstream projects include amounts for gathering growth and infrastructure improvements the distribution infrastructure projects primarily include transmission pipeline replacement 

  

the company expects to finance its capital expenditures with cash generated from operations shortterm debt and capital market transactions completed during 2008 see discussion in the “financing activities” section below regarding the financing capacity of the company 

  

for federal income tax purposes the company typically deducts as intangible drilling costs idc approximately 70 of its vertical drilling costs and 75 of its horizontal drilling costs in the year incurred the company expects that the idc deduction resulting from its increased drilling program coupled with accelerated tax depreciation for expansion of the gathering infrastructure will most likely put the company into an overall federal tax net operating loss position in 2008 which is likely to continue as long as expansion in appalachia continues the result of this change is that the company expects minimal cash taxes for the foreseeable future 

  

financing activities 

  

cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 2451 million for 2007 as compared to 2865 million of cash flows used in financing activities for 2006 a net increase of 5316 million in cash flows provided by financing activities between years the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable largely to the following 

  

·   a 3140 million increase in amounts borrowed under shortterm loans in 2007 compared to a 2293 million decrease in shortterm borrowings in 2006 the increase in shortterm borrowings in 2007 was for the purposes of funding capital expenditures and working capital requirements 

  

cash flows used in financing activities totaled 2865 million for 2006 as compared to 392 million of cash flows provided by financing activities for 2005 a net increase of 3257 million in cash flows used in financing activities between years the increase in cash flows used in financing activities was attributable largely to the following 

  

·   a 2293 million decrease in amounts borrowed under shortterm loans in 2006 compared to a 698 million increase in shortterm borrowings in 2005 the decrease in shortterm borrowings in 2006 was primarily the result of decreased requirements for funding margin deposits as previously discussed 

  

·   proceeds in 2005 from the september 2005 issuance of 1500 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5 and a maturity date of october 1 2015

·   no repurchases of shares of the company’s outstanding common stock under the company’s share repurchase program during 2006 in anticipation of the now terminated agreement to acquire peoples and hope compared to repurchases of 1223 million of common stock in 2005 

  

the company is committed to maintaining a cost effective capital structure and intends to finance future cash requirements including the portion of the 2008 capital expenditure forecast not financed by cash flows from operations using capital market transactions 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices the company’s 15 billion fiveyear revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and other purposes including support of the company’s commercial paper program historically shortterm borrowings have been used mainly to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the summer months and were generally repaid as natural gas was sold during the heating season 

  

due to the volatility in the shortterm debt markets during the second half of 2007 the company determined that its lowest cost of short term borrowings would be obtained by borrowing directly under its 15 billion revolving credit facility the company will continue to evaluate whether the commercial paper markets or direct loans under the revolving credit facility offer the lowest cost of shortterm debt capital and will obtain shortterm funding to meet its liquidity needs from either source as needed as of december 31 2007 the company had outstanding shortterm loans under the revolving credit facility of 4500 million and no commercial paper balances interest rates on shortterm borrowings averaged 58 during 2007 

  

the company’s shortterm borrowings generally have original maturities of three months or less 

  

security ratings and financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the company as of february 9 2008 changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm and longterm debt and its access to the credit markets 

  

 

  

on january 15 2008 standard  poor’s ratings services sp lowered its corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings on equitable resources inc to ‘bbb’ from ‘a’ and removed the company from creditwatch sp had put equitable on creditwatch with negative implications on march 2 2006 because of the possibility that the company would finance its purchase of peoples and hope largely with debt following equitable’s announcement of the termination of the purchase agreement sp removed the company from creditwatch and lowered its ratings with a negative outlook in its publication regarding the downgrade sp stated that equitable has been rapidly expanding its gas exploration and production and gasgathering activities in the appalachian region and the negative outlook reflects the increasing influence of equitable’s exploration and production operations over the entire company 

  

on october 31 2007 moody’s investors service moody’s completed its review of the company’s credit rating and downgraded equitable’s ratings to ‘baa1’ for senior unsecured longterm debt and ‘prime2’ for commercial paper moody’s stated that its rating reflects the company’s increased tolerance for business and financial risk as the company adopts a more growthoriented strategy moody’s did not take any further ratings action following the company’s announcement of the termination of the peoples and hope purchase agreement 

  

  

the company’s credit ratings may be subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company’s ratings particularly below investment grade it may significantly limit the company’s access to the commercial paper market and borrowing costs would increase in addition the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings incur increased margin deposit requirements with respect to its hedging instruments and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease for example the company was required to post cash margin deposits of approximately 100 million as of january 31 2008 had the company’s ratings not been downgraded the cash margin deposit required on january 31 2008 would have been less than 5 million the margin amount can change as a result of gas prices as well as credit thresholds set forth in agreements between the hedging counterparties and the company 

  

the company’s credit ratings on its noncreditenhanced senior unsecured longterm debt determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit the lower the company’s credit rating the higher the level of fees and interest rate as of december 31 2007 the company had 4500 million of borrowings against these lines of credit the company also pays facility fees to maintain credit availability as a result of the sp credit rating downgrade the company’s annualized facility fees changed from approximately 10 million to 15 million 

  

the company’s debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that if not complied with could require early payment additional collateral support or similar actions the most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s current credit facility’s financial covenants require a total debttototal capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2007 the company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants 

  

commodity risk management 

  

the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company’s risk management program includes the use of exchangetraded natural gas futures contracts and options and otc natural gas swap agreements and options collectively derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes the preponderance of derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are fixed price swaps or collars 

  

as a result the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s total hedge position for 2008 through 2010 are 

  

 

  

 the above price is based on a conversion rate of 105 mmbtumcf 

  

  

  

the company’s current hedged position provides price protection for a substantial portion of expected equity production for 2008 and a significant portion of expected equity production for the years 2009 through 2013 the company’s exposure to a 010 change in average nymex natural gas price is approximately 001 per diluted share for 2008 and ranges from 002 to 003 per diluted share per year for 2009 and 2010 the company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a and note 3 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

other items 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic business in 2005 the company agreed to maintain certain guarantees which benefit noresco these guarantees the majority of which predate the sale of noresco became offbalance sheet arrangements upon the closing of the sale of noresco these arrangements include guarantees of noresco’s obligations to the purchasers of certain of noresco’s contract receivables and agreements to maintain guarantees supporting noresco’s obligations under certain customer contracts in addition noresco and the purchaser agreed that noresco would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and that the purchaser or noresco would reimburse the company for losses under the guarantees the purchaser’s obligations to reimburse the company are capped at 6 million the total maximum potential obligation under these arrangements is estimated to be approximately 388 million as of december 31 2007 and decreases over time as the guarantees expire or the underlying obligations are fulfilled by noresco the company determined that the likelihood the company will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees 

  

in november 1995 equitable through a subsidiary guaranteed a tax indemnification to the limited partners of appalachian basin partners lp abp for any potential tax losses resulting from a disallowance of the nonconventional fuels tax credits if certain representations and warranties of the company were not true the company guaranteed the tax indemnification until the tax statute of limitations closes the company does not have any recourse provisions with third parties or any collateral held by third parties associated with this guarantee that could be liquidated to recover amounts paid if any under the guarantee as of december 31 2007 the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make is estimated to be approximately 46 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of fin 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance additionally based on the status of the company’s irs examinations the company has determined that any potential loss from this guarantee is remote 

  

the company has a nonequity interest in a variable interest entity appalachian npi llc anpi in which equitable was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary as of december 31 2007 anpi had 200 million of total assets and 333 million of total liabilities including 120 million of longterm debt including current maturities excluding minority interest 

  

the company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to anpi which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations that limit the amount of the guarantee to the calculated present value of the project’s future cash flows from the preceding yearend until the termination date of the agreement this liquidity reserve guarantee is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the appalachian natural gas trust angt the company received a marketbased fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee as of december 31 2007 the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately 20 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of fin 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance 

  

as noted above on january 15 2008 sp lowered the company’s corporate credit and senior unsecured rating to ‘bbb’ as a result of this downgrade the terms of this guarantee require the company to provide a letter of credit in favor of anpi as security for its obligations under the liquidity reserve guarantee the amount of this letter of credit requirement is approximately 264 million and is expected to decline over time under the terms of the liquidity reserve guarantee 

  

  

  

the company has entered into an agreement with angt to provide gathering and operating services to deliver angt’s gas to market in addition the company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered the revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately 158 million 168 million and 155 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s guarantees 

  

pension plans 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 which required an employer to recognize a benefit plan’s funded status in its statement of financial position measure a benefit plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year and recognize the changes in the benefit plan’s funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur the company adopted sfas no 158 as of december 31 2006 

  

total pension expense recognized by the company in 2007 2006 and 2005 excluding special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses totaled 06 million 01 million and 04 million respectively the company recognized special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2007 2006 and 2005 of 14 million 30 million and 184 million respectively 

  

during 2007 the company recognized a settlement expense of 05 million due to a plan design change for a specific union and an additional settlement expense for 05 million due to the transfer of some current active employees to nonunion employment 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2006 the company recognized a settlement expense of approximately 27 million for an early retirement program during 2005 the company settled its pension obligation with the usw local union 12050 representing 182 employees as a result of this settlement the company recognized a settlement expense of 121 million during 2005 during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company settled its pension obligation with certain nonrepresented employees as a result of this settlement the company recognized a settlement expense of approximately 24 million in 2005 

  

the company made cash contributions of approximately 13 million 18 million and 204 million to its pension plan during 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively as a result of the previously described settlements the company expects to make cash contributions of less than 01 million to its pension plan during 2008 

  

  incentive compensation 

  

the company adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 which results in the company recognizing compensation cost for all forms of sharebased payments to employees including employee stock options in its financial statements the company’s estimate of compensation cost for stock options is based on the use of the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes model is considered a “theoretical” or probability model used to estimate the price an option would sell for in the market today the company does not represent that this method yields an exact value of what an unrelated third party ie the market would be willing to pay to acquire such options 

  

the company’s recent compensation practices have focused primarily on the issuance of performancebased units and timerestricted stock awards for which it recognizes compensation expense over the applicable vesting periods management and the board of directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach closely aligns management’s incentives with shareholder rewards no new stock options were awarded in 2007 all stock options granted subsequent to 2003 have comprised options granted for reload rights associated with previouslyawarded options 

  

the company recorded approximately 02 million and 10 million respectively of compensation expense related to stock options in 2007 and 2006 the majority of which related to stock option reloads which immediately vested under the terms of the related stock option award agreements the majority of the company’s previously 

  

  

  

issued stock options were already vested at the time of adoption of sfas no 123r and associated compensation expense yet to be recognized was insignificant all stock options outstanding as of december 31 2007 are fully vested 

  

had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for prior periods’ stock option grants consistent with the methodology prescribed in sfas no 123r net income would have been reduced by an estimated 15 million or approximately 001 per diluted share for 2005 

  

the company recorded the following incentive compensation cost including amounts both expensed and capitalized in its financial statements for the periods indicated below 

  

 

  

the longterm incentive compensation is primarily associated with executive performance incentive programs the programs that were instituted starting in 2002 the vesting of the awards granted under the 2005 executive performance incentive program 2005 program will occur contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to a fixed group of peer companies and the company’s average absolute return on total capital during the four year performance period ending december 31 2008 payment of awards is expected to be made in cash and stock based on the price of the company’s common stock at the end of the performance period december 31 2008 the company accounts for these awards as liability awards and as such records compensation expense for the remeasurement of the fair value of the awards in 2007 the company increased its assumptions for both the payout multiple and ultimate share price at the vesting date december 31 2008 based on a review of the company’s performance relative to its peer group under the 2005 program as well as the significant appreciation in the company’s stock price during the period as a result the company recognized an additional 424 million of longterm incentive expenses associated with the 2005 program in 2007 the increase in incentive compensation recorded under the company’s short term incentive plan of 62 million from 2006 to 2007 includes an increase of approximately 37 million in expensed shortterm incentive costs and an increase of approximately 25 million in capitalized shortterm incentive costs the increase in shortterm incentive compensation was primarily due to favorable asset optimization results realized by equitable utilities’ marketing group the favorable results of equitable supply’s horizontal drilling program and an overall increase in employee headcount in 2007 

  

longterm incentive compensation during 2006 was lower than during 2005 due to a greater number of unvested units outstanding under the programs during 2005 than during 2006 as two programs were in effect during 2005 and only one during 2006 

  

the company currently forecasts fiscal year 2008 total incentive compensation cost under existing plans of approximately 59 million including expense of 36 million for the 2005 program the 2005 program terminates on december 31 2008 the compensation committee is currently developing a successor longterm incentive compensation program 

  

rate regulation 

  

the company’s distribution operations and pipeline operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed accounting for the company’s regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 71 as described in notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

  

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

the following table details the future projected payments associated with the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 

  

 

  

the purchase obligations amount relates primarily to annual commitments relating to the company’s natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing longterm contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to ten years approximately 255 million of these annual costs are believed to be recoverable in customer rates 

  

the other liabilities line represents the total estimated payout for the 2005 executive performance incentive program and the 2007 supply longterm incentive program see section titled “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as dedicated drilling rigs in support of the company’s drilling program in 2007 the company entered into an agreement with highlands drilling llc highlands for highlands to provide drilling equipment and services to the company these obligations totaled approximately 844 million as of december 31 2007 and are included in the operating lease obligations above also included in operating lease obligations are 13 million of terminated operating leases for facilities deemed to have no economic benefit to the company as a result of the relocation of the company to a new corporate headquarters in 2005 

  

as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the company had a total fin 48 liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2007 of 508 million the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities therefore this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations presented above 

  

contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

in june 2006 the west virginia supreme court of appeals issued a decision involving interpretation of certain types of oil and gas leases of an unrelated party in a case where a class of royalty owners in the state of west virginia had filed a lawsuit claiming that the defendant underpaid royalties by deducting certain postproduction costs not permitted by such types of leases and not paying a fair value for the gas produced from the royalty owners’ leases in january 2007 the jury in the aforementioned case returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff royalty owners awarding the plaintiffs significant compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged underpayment of royalties while the defendant has appealed the verdict this decision may ultimately impact other royalty interest rights in west virginia claims have been brought against others in the oil and gas industry including the company the company is vigorously defending its case and believes that the claims and facts in the unrelated lawsuit can be differentiated from those asserted against the company nevertheless the company has reviewed its west virginia royalty agreements and established a reserve it believes to be appropriate see item 3 “legal proceedings” for additional description of this litigation 

  

in the ordinary course of business various other legal claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with 

  

  

  

certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company has established reserves for pending litigation which it believes are adequate and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position of the company 

  

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

corporate reorganization to a holding company structure   the company has filed applications with the pa puc and wv psc to reorganize into a holding company the company is pursing a holding company reorganization because the company believes that the separation of its stateregulated distribution operations into a new subsidiary will better segregate its regulated and unregulated businesses and improve overall financing flexibility to effect the reorganization the company intends to merge with a second tier subsidiary mergersub which will result in a first tier subsidiary new eqt becoming the new publicly traded parent company of the equitable resources family of companies following the merger the company will transfer to new eqt all of the assets and liabilities of the company other than those of the company’s existing equitable gas company division and new eqt and its subsidiaries will continue to conduct the business and operations that the company and its subsidiaries conducted immediately before the effective time of the reorganization 

  

the company successfully completed a request for direction to holders of notes under the indentures governing its longterm debt the company has also received a noaction letter from the sec satisfactorily addressing certain elements of the proposed reorganization the company expects to complete the reorganization upon receipt of pa puc and wv psc approvals

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon equitable’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed and approved by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

share based compensation the company awards sharebased compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 1999 longterm incentive plan the company treats its executive performance incentive programs as variable plan liabilities the actual cost to be recorded for the 2005 executive performance incentive program 2005 program will not be known until the measurement date which is december 31 2008 requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized the number of units to be paid out under the 2005 program is dependent upon a combination of a level of total shareholder return relative to the performance of a peer group and the company’s average absolute return on capital during the fouryear performance period in 2007 the company implemented the 2007 supply longterm incentive program 2007 supply program also a variable plan liability the number of units to be paid out under the 2007 supply program is dependent upon the achievement of predetermined total sales volumes targets and the satisfaction of certain applicable employment requirements the company reviews the assumptions for both programs on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the value of the ultimate payout in the current period the company estimated that the performance measures for the 2005 program would be met at 225 of the full value of the units and that the estimated end of 2008 share price would be 6000 this was an increase from the company’s assumptions in 2006 of 175 of the full value of the units and an estimated end of 2008 share price of 4500 which resulted in a significant compensation expense charge in 2007 the company estimated that the performance measures for the 2007 supply program would be met at 100 of the full value of the units and that the estimated end of 2010 share price would be 7200 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to sharebased compensation are “critical accounting estimates” because they are likely to change from period to period based on changes in the market price of the company’s shares the performance of the peer group for the 2005 program and the achievement of predetermined total sales volumes targets for the 2007 supply program  additionally the impact on net income of these changes can be material management’s assumptions regarding these performance factors require significant judgment in regard to the 2005 program each peer company’s inherent volatility combined with the volatility in commodity prices make it difficult to provide sensitivity metrics to demonstrate the impact a change in the company’s stock price will have on the estimated payout however assuming no change in the attainment of performance measures a 10 increase in the company’s stock price assumption for december 31 2008 would result in an increase in 2008 compensation expense under the longterm incentive plan of approximately 14 million a 10 decrease in the company’s stock price assumptions would result in a decrease in 2008 compensation expense of the same amount 

  

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse see note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from marktomarket hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss deferred revenues and expenses and state net operating loss carryforwards the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized the company also recorded a 01 million charge in 2007 and 2006 and a 153 million charge in 

  

  

2005 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain executive compensation plans as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under section 162m of the irc no other valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets any change in the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes under the provisions of fin 48 this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the recognition threshold is the first step which requires the company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position in order to record any financial statement benefit if the first step is satisfied then the company must measure the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement see note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement to the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed and considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement 

  

contingencies and asset retirement obligations  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the recording of contingencies is guided by the principles of sfas no 5 the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results 

  

in addition to the obligation to record contingent liabilities sfas no 143 requires that the company accrue a liability for legal asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of their settlement for oil and gas wells t he fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations is required to be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company increases the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the company is required to operate and maintain its natural gas pipeline and storage systems and intends to do so as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists which the company expects for the foreseeable future therefore the company believes that the substantial majority of its natural gas pipeline and storage system assets have indeterminate lives 

  

  

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are “critical accounting estimates” because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations in addition the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

accounting for oil and gas producing activities  the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas production activities depletion is calculated based on the annual actual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit the depletion rate is derived by dividing the total costs capitalized over the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves 

  

the carrying values of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred the company estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from its proved oil and gas properties and compares them to their respective carrying values the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based on proved reserves utilizing assumptions about the use of the asset and forward market prices for oil and gas proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows would be deemed unrecoverable those properties would be written down to fair value which would be estimated using assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value in developing estimates of fair value the company uses forward market prices 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the remaining recoverable proved reserves a process which is significantly impacted by forward market prices for oil and gas should the company begin to develop new producing regions or begin more significant exploration activities future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

oil and gas reserves  proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions reserve estimates are prepared and updated by the company’s engineers and reviewed by the company’s independent engineers additionally the company estimates future rates of production the timing of development expenditures and prospective market prices for oil and gas and applies the appropriate year end income tax rate 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production and the estimated timing of development expenditures future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 

  

  


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative commodity instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through the equitable supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the equitable utilities segment the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 of this form 10k the company uses nonleveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

  

commodity price risk 

  

the following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10 increase and a 10 decrease in commodity prices 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge forecasted natural gas purchases and sales which are exposed to price risk the company sets limits related to acceptable exposure levels 

  

the financial instruments currently utilized by the company include futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity the company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy 

  

management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted historically the company’s strategy has been to hedge production at prices considered to provide the opportunity to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility the company may revisit its hedging strategy as a result of the increase in well development and infrastructure investment at equitable supply to the extent that the company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price the company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2007 the company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2013 and portions of forecasted purchases and sales by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 2519 bcf of natural gas see the “commodity risk management” in the “capital resources and liquidity” sections of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k for further discussion for the sensitivity analysis set forth below the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal change in fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2007 the price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s balance sheet resulting in the change in fair value 

  

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2007 levels would increase the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 1945 million a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2007 levels would decrease the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately the same amount 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

  

  

for derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes the company engages in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits the financial instruments currently utilized by the company for trading purposes include forward contracts and swap agreements 

  

a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2007 levels would not have a significant impact on the fair value of derivative commodity instruments held by the company for trading purposes as of december 31 2007 

  

other market risks 

  

the company has variable rate shortterm debt as such there is some exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the company under its current capital structure the company maintains fixed rate longterm debt that is not subject to risk exposure from fluctuating interest rates 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because the commodity futures trading commission regulations are in place to protect exchange participants including the company from any potential financial instability of the exchange members the company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the company’s criteria for credit and liquidity strength 

  

the company utilizes various information technology systems to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits to manage the level of credit risk the company deals with counterparties that are of investment grade or better enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security 

  

three percent or 137 million of otc derivative contracts outstanding at december 31 2007 have a positive fair value all derivative contracts outstanding as of december 31 2007 are with counterparties who have an sp rating of a or above 

  

as of december 31 2007 there was no event of default with any counterparty to a derivative contract furthermore the company made no adjustments to the fair value of derivative contracts due to creditrelated concerns the company will continue to monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of derivative contracts reported in the consolidated balance sheet

business segments 

equitable utilities 

equitable utilities’ operations comprise the gathering transportation storage distribution and sale of natural gas equitable utilities has both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated activities consist of the company’s stateregulated distribution operations and federallyregulated pipeline and storage operations the nonregulated activities include the nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas risk management activities for the company and the sale of energyrelated products and services equitable utilities generated approximately ­­36 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2006 

distribution operations 

equitable utilities’ distribution operations are carried out by equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory for the distribution operations includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia these areas have a rather static population and economy the distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 274000 customers comprising 255400 residential customers and 18600 commercial and industrial customers equitable gas purchases gas through contracts with various sources including major and independent producers in the gulf coast local producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate these contracts contain various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices 

equitable gas’ distribution rates terms of service contracts with affiliates and issuance of securities are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the wv psc the field line sales rates in kentucky are also subject to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania which is not subject to comprehensive regulation 

the company must usually seek approval of one or more of its regulators prior to increasing or decreasing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and transportation activities it is allowed to recover a return in addition to the costs of its transportation activities however the company’s regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term equitable gas has worked with and continues to work with regulators to implement alternative performancebased rates equitable gas’ tariffs for commercial and industrial customers allow for negotiated rates in limited circumstances equitable gas has not filed a base rate case since 1997 and its predominant approach to maximizing value is cost control and operational excellence regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company is not aware of any significant noncompliance as a result of any completed audits 

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 72 of calendar year 2006 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during the offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

on march 1 2006 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire dominion resources inc’s natural gas distribution assets in pennsylvania and in west virginia for approximately 970 million subject to adjustments in a cash transaction for the stock of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc the transaction requires approvals from the pa puc and the wv psc and is also under review by the pennsylvania attorney general and by the federal trade commission ftc on february 9 2007 an administrative law judge for the pa puc issued an initial decision approving the stock acquisition subject to the terms and conditions of the joint petition for settlement filed by the company and a number of the intervening parties the joint petition for 

settlement includes among other things an agreement by the company that equitable gas company and the peoples natural gas company will not make base rate case filings prior to january 1 2009 under the commission’s rules a period for filing exceptions and reply exceptions has begun to run based upon the thorough manner in which the administrative law judge addressed the testimony of opposing parties the company believes it likely that the pa puc will approve the stock acquisition when it reviews the application in march or april of 2007 the wv psc procedural schedule calls for hearings in midmay 2007 the wv psc staff and consumer advocate the independent oil and gas association of west virginia and the utility workers union of america local 69 division 1 have intervened in the west virginia regulatory case the company continues to engage in settlement negotiations with these interveners the company is complying with the information requests of the pennsylvania attorney general and the ftc and is targeting an approval timeframe not long after receiving approval from the pa puc no assurance is given that the targeted timeframes will be achieved the company’s acquisition agreement expires on march 31 2007 unless a closing has not occurred due to a failure to obtain a required governmental consent or authorization and such is being diligently pursued in which case the expiration date is automatically extended to june 30 2007 the agreement will then terminate if no closing occurs by june 30 2007 unless the parties agree to an extension the assets to be acquired will increase customers in the distribution operations by 475000 or 173 total storage capacity by 33 bcf or 60 miles of gathering pipelines by 936 miles gathered volumes by 40 and miles of high pressure transmission by 466 miles or 42 transition planning activities have commenced at equitable utilities to plan for the integration of the assets resources and business processes of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc’s into equitable resources 

pipeline transportation and storage operations 

equitable utilities’ interstate pipeline operations are carried out by equitrans lp equitrans these operations offer gas gathering transportation storage and related services to affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and amerada hess corporation in 2006 approximately 77 of transportation volumes and approximately 62 of transportation revenues were from affiliates 

in the second quarter of 2006 the company filed a certificate application with the ferc for approval to build a 70mile 20inch diameter pipeline which will connect the companyoperated kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant in langley kentucky to the tennessee gas pipeline in carter county kentucky and will initially provide up to 130000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service the pipeline known as the big sandy pipeline is owned and operated by equitrans and is targeted for completion in 2007 equitrans has secured most of the materials labor and rightsofway necessary to complete the project equitrans received a ferc certificate on november 15 2006 authorizing construction of the pipeline subject to certain operational commercial and environmental conditions equitrans’ implementation plan addressed those conditions and received ferc approval on november 29 2006 capital expenditures incurred by the company in 2006 related to the big sandy pipeline are included in the equitable supply business segment 

equitrans’ rates are subject to regulation by the ferc on april 5 2006 the ferc approved a settlement to equitrans’ consolidated 2005 and 2004 rate case filings the settlement became effective on june 1 2006 the settlement provided for the following 

·   an expected annual revenue increase of 60 million and an expected operating income increase of 32 million

·   replenishment of 71 bcf of migrated base gas from prior periods

·   consolidation of transmission assets into a single transmission system with a systemwide rate

·   consolidation of gathering assets into a single gathering system with a systemwide rate

·   tracking and recovery of costs relating to compliance with the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002

·   redesigned contract storage services

·   fiveyear rate moratorium on gathering rates

·   threeyear rate moratorium on transmission rates

equitrans’ firm transportation contracts expire between 2007 and 2009 the company anticipates that the majority of the related volumes will be fully subscribed when they become available 

energy marketing 

equitable utilities’ unregulated marketing operations include the nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas at equitable gas marketing and risk management activities at equitable energy llc equitable energy and the sale of energyrelated products and services by equitable homeworks llc services and products offered by the marketing operations include commodity procurement delivery and storage services such as park and loan services risk management and other services for energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers equitable energy also engages in trading and risk management activities for the company the objective of these activities is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets 

equitable supply 

equitable supply’s production business develops produces and sells natural gas and to a limited extent crude oil and natural gas liquids in the appalachian region of the united states its gathering business consists of gathering the company’s and third party gas and the processing of natural gas liquids equitable supply generated approximately 64 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2006 

production 

equitable supply’s production business operating through equitable production company and several other affiliates collectively referred to as “equitable production” is the largest owner of proved natural gas reserves in the appalachian basin the company’s reserves are located entirely in the appalachian basin where equitable production currently operates approximately 12000 producing wells 

the appalachian basin is characterized by wells with comparatively low rates of annual decline in production long well lives low production costs per well and high energy content many of the company’s wells have been producing for decades and in some cases since the early 1900’s management believes that virtually all of the company’s wells are low risk development wells because they are drilled in areas known to be productive many of these wells are completed in more than one producing formation including coal formations in certain areas and production from these formations may be commingled the company’s 2006 drilling program was comprised dominantly of vertical wells but also included horizontal drilling 

in 2006 equitable production drilled 560 gross operated wells 427 net operated wells including 5 horizontal wells and 95 gross nonoperated wells 28 net nonoperated wells at a success rate of nearly 100 drilling was concentrated within equitable’s core areas of southwestern virginia southeastern kentucky and southern west virginia this activity resulted in proved developed reserve additions of approximately 120 bcfe of the proved developed reserve additions approximately 60 bcfe relates to proved undeveloped reserves that were transferred to proved developed reserves and an equal amount relates to proved developed extensions discoveries and other additions that were not previously classified as proved 

the natural gas produced by equitable supply is a commodity and therefore the company receives marketbased pricing the market price for gas located in the appalachian basin is generally higher than the price for gas located in the gulf coast largely due to the differential in the cost to transport gas to customers in the northeastern united states the recent increase in production in the appalachian basin by the company and other producers is putting pressure on the capacity of existing gathering and midstream transport systems as a result the company has entered into certain discounted sales arrangements to ensure that its gas continues to flow 

the combination of longlived production low drilling costs high drilling completion rates and proximity to natural gas markets has resulted in a highly fragmented operating environment in the appalachian basin natural gas drilling activity has increased as suppliers in the appalachian basin attempt to take advantage of higher than normal natural gas prices while increased activity can place constraints on capacity of labor equipment pipeline 

availability and other resources in the appalachian basin it also provides opportunities for expansion of natural gas gathering activities and potential for higher quality rigs and labor providers in the future 

equitable supply hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production it also hedges third party purchases and sales the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments are outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

gathering 

equitable gathering derives its revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the appalachian basin as of december 31 2006 the system included approximately 7100 miles of gathering line located throughout west virginia eastern kentucky and southwestern virginia over 85 of the gathering system volumes are transported to interconnects with three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans the company’s interstate pipeline affiliate maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to geographically diverse markets 

gathering system sales volumes for 2006 totaled 1086 bcfe of which approximately 64 related to the gathering of equitable production’s gas volumes 26 related to third party volumes and the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company continued to operate for a fee approximately 82 of equitable gathering’s 2006 revenues were from affiliates due to increased operating costs and capital investment equitable gathering is in certain cases charging gathering rates which are below its cost of service equitable gathering continues to pursue full recovery of these costs by increasing rates charged to its customers 

key competitors for new gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated appalachian energy companies see “outlook” under equitable supply’s section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for discussion of the company’s strategy in regards to its midstream gathering operations 

transfer of gathering assets 

effective january 1 2006 certain gathering assets consisting of 1400 miles of gathering line and related facilities with approximately 133 bcf of annual throughput were transferred from equitable supply to equitable utilities for segment reporting purposes the effect of the transfer is not material to the results of operations or financial position of the equitable utilities or equitable supply segments segment results have not been restated for this transfer 

discontinued operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company sold its noresco domestic business for 82 million before customary purchase price adjustments in the second quarter of 2006 the company completed the sale of the remaining interest in its investment in igceri panam thermal generating limited pan am previously included in the noresco business segment for total proceeds of 26 million as a result of these transactions the company has reclassified its financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the operating results of the noresco segment as discontinued operations

 item 1a risk factors risks relating to our business 

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations 

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability and liquidity 

our revenue profitability and liquidity depend on the price for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the proximity to and availability of capacity on transportation facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation royalties and price controls 

increases in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels significant price increases such as occurred in the fall and winter of 2005 subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts hedging arrangements including futures contracts swap agreements and exchange traded instruments which require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction in such cases we are however exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our hedge counterparties of their obligations under the derivative contracts in addition to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price we are unable to benefit fully from the increase in the price of natural gas 

lower natural gas prices increases in our estimates of development costs or changes to our production assumptions may result in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves change our production plans and incur noncash charges to earnings 

our failure to assess production opportunities based on market conditions could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects for our production business 

our goal of sustaining longterm growth for our production business is contingent upon our ability to identify production opportunities based on market conditions successfully identifying production opportunities involves a high degree of business experience knowledge and careful evaluation of potential opportunities along with subjective judgments and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect 

our failure to develop and maintain the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver gas to market may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

our gas delivery depends on the availability of adequate transportation infrastructure we have announced a significant investment in transportation infrastructure the big sandy pipeline which is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing transportation pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines we are also planning an upgrade to the companyoperated hydrocarbon processing plant in langley kentucky for completion in early 2008 our infrastructure development program can involve significant risks including those related to timing and cost overruns and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital materials and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology and other factors in addition we may not be able to obtain sufficient third party transportation contracts to recover the costs of our infrastructure development program we also deliver to and are served by third party gas gathering transportation 

processing and storage facilities which are limited in number and geographically concentrated an extended interruption of access to or service from these facilities could result in material adverse consequences to us 

the amount and timing of actual future gas production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

our future success depends on our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to maximize existing well production and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings we have expanded our drilling program in recent years and we have subsequently announced further expansion our drilling of development wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing and cost overruns and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology and other factors drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit due to inadequate well operation and compressor availability without continued successful development or acquisition activities our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

we may engage in acquisition and disposition strategies that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits and may adversely affect our earnings cash flows and results of operations 

on march 1 2006 we signed a purchase agreement to acquire the capital stock of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc from consolidated natural gas company a whollyowned subsidiary of dominion resources inc in addition we intend to continue to strategically position our business in order to improve our ability to compete acquisitions joint ventures and other business combinations involve various inherent risks such as assessing the value strengths weaknesses contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or other transaction candidates the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business the constraints imposed by regulators in approving such transactions the potential for unions of an acquired business to strike our ability to achieve identified financial and operating synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction demands on management related to the increase in size after an acquisition or other transaction and unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquisition or other transaction we may be unable to realize or do so within any particular time frame the cost reductions cash flow increases or other synergies expected to result from such transactions in addition various factors including prevailing market conditions and the incursion of related contingent liabilities could negatively impact the benefits we receive from transactions 

if we fail to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any acquisition or disposition transaction it could have a significant adverse affect on our earnings cash flows and results of operations furthermore if we borrow money to finance an acquisition which we plan to do in connection with the acquisition of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc our failure to achieve our stated goals could impact our ability to repay such borrowings or other borrowings and could weaken our financial condition moreover additional debt could increase our vulnerability to the effects of interest rate movements 

we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our pipelines and facilities 

our business operations are subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the production transportation storage and distribution of natural gas these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage as a result we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability of such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

significant portions of our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are subject to state and federal regulation including regulation of the rates which we may assess our customers the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety complying with these requirements could have a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position if we fail to comply with these requirements even if caused by factors beyond our control such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us 

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by equitable supply which often fluctuate could be increased by the respective taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability  

see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion regarding the company’s exposure to market risks including the risks associated with our use of derivative contracts to hedge commodity prices

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

equitable’s consolidated income from continuing operations for 2006 was 2160 million or 177 per diluted share compared with 2586 million or 209 per diluted share for 2005 and 2988 million or 237 per diluted share for 2004 

the 426 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2006 included the impact of several factors in 2005 the company recognized a pretax gain of 1103 million on the sale of kerrmcgee corporation kerrmcgee shares in 2006 the company incurred 123 million of transition planning expenses relating to the pending acquisition of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc the company also established a reserve for west virginia royalty disputes the impact of lower realized selling prices 258 million and warmer weather 93 million also contributed to the decrease between years 

decreases in income from continuing operations between years were partially offset by 2005 charges of 160 million for the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and of 78 million for the company’s office consolidation as well as the 2006 favorable impact of the equitrans rate case settlement additionally income from continuing operations for 2006 was positively impacted by reduced expenses related to the executive performance incentive programs 227 million favorable storage asset optimization 164 million and higher production sales volumes 116 million 

the 402 million decrease in income from continuing operations from 2004 to 2005 was primarily the result of several factors the company recorded a gain in 2004 as a result of the westport resources corporation westportkerrmcgee merger in the second quarter of 2004 as well as a gain on the sale of 08 million kerrmcgee shares subsequent to the merger these gains were partially offset by an expense related to the company’s charitable contribution of 04 million kerrmcgee shares to the equitable resources foundation inc in 2004 the 2005 gain from the sale of the company’s remaining kerrmcgee shares partially offset the impact of the 2004 items 

income from continuing operations was favorably impacted in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher realized selling prices an increase in sales volumes from production and increased revenues from storage asset optimization these increases were offset in some part by increased operating costs resulting primarily from higher natural gas prices and sales volumes increased incentive expenses and impairment charges related to the company’s office consolidation 

the company’s effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2006 was 337 compared to 372 for the year ended december 31 2005 and 342 for the year ended december 31 2004 the higher effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily the result of tax benefit disallowances under section 162m of the irc see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

business segment results 

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income net interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive costs pension costs and administrative costs totaling 219 million 480 million and 458 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively were not allocated to business segments the decrease in unallocated expenses from 2005 to 2006 was primarily related to decreased longterm incentive expenses 

the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income net to the company’s consolidated operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments and other income net totals in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

additionally these subtotals are reconciled to the company’s consolidated net income in note 2 the company has also reported the components of each segment’s operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived equitable’s management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition operations and trends of each of equitable’s segments without being obscured by the financial condition operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes 

equitable utilities 

overview 

equitable utilities’ net operating revenues increased 85 from 2005 to 2006 this increase was primarily due to increased pipeline revenues from the settlement of the equitrans rate case effective june 1 2006 as well as favorable marketing revenues resulting from volatile natural gas prices as the marketing operations were able to take advantage of their asset position and achieve record margins from that business in 2006 the marketing business is primarily driven by equitable utilities’ physical and contractual gas storage assets which allow the segment to purchase gas and store it in lower price markets and simultaneously enter into contracts to sell it later at higher prices taking advantage of near term seasonal gas price spreads those spreads are unpredictable and at times were considerably wider in 2006 than they were in 2005 

the positive results from the pipeline and marketing operations were partially offset by reduced revenues in equitable utilities’ distribution operations as the weather in equitable gas’ service territory in 2006 was 15 warmer than the 30 year average and 10 warmer than 2005 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa reported that the 2006 average annual temperature for the contiguous us was the warmest on record noaa also reported that based on the unusually warm temperatures during much of the first half of the winter season october to december 2006 the nation’s residential energy demand was approximately 135 percent lower than what would have occurred under average climate conditions for the season 

operating expenses at equitable utilities decreased 3 driven primarily by the absence of charges related to pension plans and the company’s office consolidation that occurred in 2005 offset somewhat by transition planning expenses incurred in 2006 related to the pending acquisition of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc and the recognition of costs previously deferred as a result of the equitrans rate case settlement 

expenses were also positively impacted by a reduction in bad debt expense in 2006 equitable continued its consistent and aggressive collections strategy as permitted by the responsible utility customer protection act which became effective on december 14 2004 in december 2005 the pa puc approved equitable gas’s petition requesting approval to use up to 7 million of pipeline supplier refunds to benefit lowincome customers in its service territory primarily during the winter heating season approximately 49 million and 03 million of this amount was credited to eligible customers’ accounts during 2006 and 2005 respectively the execution of the collections strategy and provision of additional customer energy assistance enabled equitable utilities to reduce its delinquent customer base by 20 as of december 2006 compared to december 2005 these efforts were significant in enabling equitable utilities to reduce its bad debt expense in 2006 despite unusually high gas cost rates in effect during 2006 and 2005 

on march 1 2006 the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire dominion resources inc’s natural gas distribution assets in pennsylvania and in west virginia for approximately 970 million subject to adjustments in a cash transaction for the stock of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc the transaction requires approvals from the pa puc and the wv psc and is also under review by the pennsylvania attorney general and by the federal trade commission ftc on february 9 2007 an administrative law judge for the pa puc issued an initial decision approving the stock acquisition subject to the terms and conditions of the joint petition for settlement filed by the company and a number of the intervening parties the joint petition for settlement includes among other things an agreement by the company that equitable gas company and the peoples natural gas company will not make base rate case filings prior to january 1 2009 under the commission’s rules a period for filing exceptions and reply exceptions has begun to run based upon the thorough 

manner in which the administrative law judge addressed the testimony of opposing parties the company believes it likely that the pa puc will approve the stock acquisition when it reviews the application in march or april of 2007 the wv psc procedural schedule calls for hearings in midmay 2007 the wv psc staff and consumer advocate the independent oil and gas association of west virginia and the utility workers union of america local 69 division 1 have intervened in the west virginia regulatory case the company continues to engage in settlement negotiations with these interveners the company is complying with the information requests of the pennsylvania attorney general and the ftc and is targeting an approval timeframe not long after receiving approval from the pa puc no assurance is given that the targeted timeframes will be achieved the company’s acquisition agreement expires on march 31 2007 unless a closing has not occurred due to a failure to obtain a required governmental consent or authorization and such is being diligently pursued in which case the expiration date is automatically extended to june 30 2007 the agreement will then terminate if no closing occurs by june 30 2007 unless the parties agree to an extension 

with the relatively recent repeal of the public utility holding company act of 1935 the company has filed applications with the pa puc and wv psc to reorganize as a holding company currently equitable gas is a division of equitable resources inc which requires the company to obtain regulatory approval for many actions that are not directly related to the distribution operations such as acquisitions and financings this requirement restricts the company’s ability to take advantage of opportunities and market conditions the company successfully completed a request for direction to holders of notes under the indentures governing its longterm debt upon receipt of the other required approvals the company expects to complete the reorganization in 2006 the company expensed 16 million of costs related to the holding company implementation

equitable utilities’ operating income totaled 1252 million for 2006 compared to 983 million for 2005 equitable utilities’ operating income increased 269 million primarily due to increased net marketing revenues lower expenses related to defined benefit pension plans increased pipeline operating income reduction in bad debt expense an impairment charge in 2005 in connection with the company’s office consolidation and a gain in 2006 as a result of the partial reversal of the office impairment charge recorded in 2005 these improvements are partially offset by the impact of costs incurred in planning for the pending acquisition of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc and a reduction in distribution gas sales margins due to weather 15 warmer than the 30year average 

net operating revenues were 2750 million for 2006 compared to 2534 million for 2005 the 216 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased pipeline and marketing net operating revenues partially offset by lower distribution net operating revenues pipeline operations’ net operating revenues increased 188 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the settlement of equitrans’ 2003 ferc rate case and the implementation of new rates and contracts in connection with that settlement the settlement’s approval which occurred in april 2006 improved net operating revenues by 70 million related to years 2005 and prior and an additional 57 million related to the transfer of certain gathering assets from equitable supply new contract rates and billing determinants in the settlement result in the remaining 61 increase in pipeline net operating revenues the increase in marketing net operating revenues of 164 million resulted primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in the volatile natural gas commodity price environment distribution operations’ net operating revenues decreased 135 million primarily due to decreased residential sales and transportation volumes which decreased 3666 mmcf from 2005 to 2006 due primarily to warmer weather 

operating expenses totaled 1498 million for 2006 compared to 1551 million for 2005 operating expenses for 2005 included 160 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a 38 million loss related to the impairment of certain leased offices furniture and equipment in connection with the company’s relocation into its new consolidated office space operating expenses for 2006 include 123 million of costs incurred in planning for the pending acquisition of the peoples natural gas 

company and hope gas inc a 29 million increase in gathering expenses as a result of the transfer of certain assets from equitable supply the recognition of 46 million of previously deferred postretirement benefit obligation expenses in the pipeline business both in connection with the ferc rate case settlement and the reversal of 24 million of the 2005 office impairment charge as the space previously abandoned was put back into use for the transition planning activities relating to the pending acquisition of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc excluding these items operating expenses decreased 29 million which was primarily a result of decreases in distribution and marketing bad debt expense totaling 52 million offset by increases of 09 million in depreciation expense and 08 million in general liability insurance expenses the improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of nonpaying customers improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process the increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in equitable utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices 

fiscal year ended december 31 2005 vs december 31 2004 

equitable utilities’ operating income totaled ­­983 million for 2005 compared to 1081 million for 2004 net operating income for 2005 included charges for the termination and settlement of defined benefit pension plans and an impairment charge in connection with the company’s office consolidation 

net operating revenues were 2534 million for 2005 compared to 2427 million for 2004 the 107 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased marketing net operating revenues of 142 million resulting primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in a high and increasingly volatile natural gas commodity price environment distribution operations’ net operating revenues decreased 22 million due to decreased volumes distribution operations’ residential sales and transportation volumes decreased 840 mmcf from 2004 to 2005 due to decreased base load and lower customer use per degree day these reductions resulted from increased customer conservation more timely termination of nonpaying customers in 2005 and other factors increased volumes as a result of colder weather partially offset these decreases in residential volumes as heating degree days were 5543 in 2005 which was 3 colder than the 5360 heating degree days in 2004 although still warmer than normal distribution operations’ commercial and industrial volumes decreased 4229 mmcf from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a reduction in industrial throughput to two major steelmaking customers these high volume industrial sales have very low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues pipeline operations’ net operating revenues decreased 13 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a 38 million loss on fuel and retention in excess of the current rates this loss was partially offset by increased revenues earned in loaning and parking services these services are contracted on an asavailable basis as opposed to longterm firm storage contracts this flexibility allows customers including the company’s marketing affiliate to take advantage of the pipeline’s available storage to secure future supply at favorable prices these services were heavily subscribed in 2005 as higher volatility in natural gas prices provided substantial value for storage options 

operating expenses totaled 1551 million for 2005 compared to 1346 million for 2004 operating expenses for 2005 included 160 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a 38 million loss related to the impairment of certain leased offices furniture and equipment in connection with the company’s relocation into its new consolidated office space excluding these items operating expenses increased 07 million which resulted from increases of 23 million in depreciation expense 22 million in incentive compensation 14 million in customer operations expenses and 11 million in employee benefit costs largely offset by decreases of 47 million in bad debt expense and 14 million in insurance costs the increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in equitable utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices the improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of nonpaying customers a full year impact of a 030 per mcf regulatory surcharge instituted in april 2004 improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process these improvements were offset somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2005 by high commodity rates and cold weather which resulted in increased provisions for bad debt in that period compared to the prior year

equitable supply 

overview 

equitable supply’s sales revenues for 2006 were essentially flat in comparison with 2005 revenues sales volumes increased more than 5 from 2005 excluding volumes from properties sold during 2005 primarily as a result of increased production from the 2006 and 2005 drilling programs partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s existing wells equitable supply drilled 560 gross operated wells in 2006 compared to 420 gross operated wells in 2005 a 33 increase the 560 operated wells included 5 horizontal wells and 16 wells drilled as part of a coal bed methane infill pilot 

the positive results experienced from the increased sales volumes were more than offset by a 7 decline in the average wellhead sales price due primarily to decreased market prices the average nymex price decreased 16 in 2006 from the abnormally high price levels in 2005 negatively impacting revenues from sales of unhedged volumes 

operating expenses at equitable supply increased 12 primarily due to certain nonrecurring charges for royalty disputes bad debt expenses and pension and other postretirement plans as well as higher dda and gathering and compression expenses resulting from increased drilling and infrastructure investments as the company continues to expand its development and midstream activities in the appalachian basin

fiscal year ended december 31 2006 vs december 31 2005 

equitable supply’s operating income totaled 2692 million for 2006 compared to 2936 million for 2005 a decrease of 244 million between years production operating income decreased 291 million primarily due to a decrease in wellhead sales price and an increase in production operating expenses partially offset by increased sales volumes gathering operating income increased 47 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses 

total operating revenues were 4886 million for 2006 compared to 4892 million for 2005 the 06 million decrease in net operating revenues was primarily due to a 7 per mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price partially offset by a 3 increase in production total sales volumes and a 12 increase in gathering revenues the 034 per mcfe decrease in the average wellhead sales price was mainly attributable to decreased market prices on unhedged volumes and increased gathering charges partially offset by the absence of a 2005 

negative price adjustment the 2005 adjustment was principally due to the company’s conclusion that the wellhead sales price allocated to a third party’s working interest gas in previous periods may have been lower than the company was obligated to pay   the 3 increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the 2006 and 2005 drilling programs partially offset by the sale of certain noncore gas properties in 2005 and the normal production decline in the company’s wells the 12 increase in gathering revenues was attributable to a 24 increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by a 10 decline in gathered volumes the increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the company’s commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases the average gathering fee was also positively impacted by the transfer of certain regulated gathering facilities to equitable utilities the decrease in gathered volumes in 2006 was primarily due to the transfer of gathering facilities to equitable utilities the sale of gathering assets in 2005 and thirdparty customer volume shutins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines these factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for company production in 2006 

operating expenses totaled 2194 million for 2006 compared to 1956 million for 2005 the 238 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 92 million in sga 78 million in gathering and compression 56 million in dda 14 million in loe and 04 million in production taxes partially offset by a 05 million impairment charge in 2005 related to the company’s office consolidation the increase in sga was the result of reserves established in connection with west virginia royalty disputes and bad debt expenses the increase in gathering and compression was primarily due to pension and other postretirement benefits charges for an early retirement program totaling 33 million increased compressor station operation and repair costs including electricity on newly installed compressors increased property taxes and increased field labor and related employment costs these factors were partially offset by the transfer of gathering facilities to equitable utilities and the sale of gathering assets in 2005 the increase in dda was due to a 003 per mcf increase in the unit depletion rate 20 million increased depreciation on a higher asset base 20 million and increased produced volumes 16 million the increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base the increase in loe was primarily due to increased direct well expenses and well and location repairs and maintenance partially offset by the sale of gas properties in 2005 the increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes 24 million partially offset by decreased severance taxes 20 million the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the company’s wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes the decrease in severance taxes a production tax directly imposed on the value of gas extracted was primarily due to lower gas commodity prices in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes the impairment charges in 2005 were related to the company’s relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations of its new consolidated office space 

fiscal year ended december 31 2005 vs december 31 2004 

equitable supply’s operating income totaled 2936 million for 2005 compared to 2274 million for 2004 an increase of 662 million between years production operating income increased 482 million primarily due to an increase in wellhead sales price and an increase in sales volumes partially offset by increased production operating expenses gathering operating income increased 180 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses 

total operating revenues were 4892 million for 2005 compared to 3904 million for 2004 the 988 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to a 16 increase in the average wellhead sales price a 9 increase in production total sales volumes and a 33 increase in gathering revenues the 071 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price was mainly attributable to increased market prices on unhedged volumes partially offset by the adjustment related to a third party’s working interest gas as previously discussed the 9 increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of the purchase of esp partially offset by the sale of gas properties the 33 increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to a 41 increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by a 5 decline in gathered volumes the increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the company’s commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases the decrease in gathered volumes in 2005 was primarily due to the sale of gathering assets and thirdparty customer volume shutins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines these factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for company production in 2005 these increases 

in production and gathering revenues were partially offset by the recognition of a gain of 27 million in 2004 that resulted from the renegotiation of a processing agreement 

operating expenses totaled 1956 million for 2005 compared to 1631 million for 2004 a significant reason for this 325 million increase was due to additional costs of 150 million resulting from the purchase of esp the 150 million of costs were primarily related to dda 47 million production taxes 46 million lease operating expenses 37 million and gathering expenses 20 million excluding the esp costs the 175 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 91 million in production taxes 44 million in dda 21 million in sga 08 million in loe 06 million in gathering expenses and 05 million in impairment charges related to the company’s office consolidation the increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes 54 million and severance taxes 37 million the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years the increase in severance taxes was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes in 2005 as compared to prior years 

the increase in dda excluding esp was due to a 005 per mcf increase in the unit depletion rate 43 million and increased depreciation on a higher asset base 14 million partially offset by lower depletion as a result of decreased volumes from the sale of gas properties 13 million the increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 and 2004 the increase in sga was the result of increased legal and professional fees and bad debt expenses the increase in loe was the result of the company’s strategy to focus on current infrastructure as well as increased costs from vendors due to higher gas prices the increase in gathering expenses was primarily attributable to increased electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors field labor and related employment costs and compressor station operation and repair costs the gathering and compression increases are consistent with the company’s strategic decision to focus on improving gathering and compression and metering effectiveness such increases were partially offset by reductions in gathering expenses due to reduced gathered volumes 

other income net for 2004 was the result of a 61 million settlement received from a previously disputed insurance coverage claim offset by a 55 million expense related to the company’s settlement of a prepaid forward contract in 2004

outlook 

equitable supply’s appalachian basin business strategy is focused on growing through expansion of its drilling program and gathering systems the company will continue to emphasize operational excellence including cost control in all areas of its operations key elements of equitable supply’s strategy include 

·   expanding production through the drilling program equitable supply has a multiyear drilling program which includes increased drilling of conventional wells down spacing coal bed methane wells continuing its horizontal drilling efforts and selectively participating in nonoperated wells developed on acreage held by the company these efforts will enable the company to continue the growth of its production business equitable supply intends to drill 650 gross operated wells in 2007 including at least 25 horizontal wells a 16 increase over the 560 gross operated wells drilled in 2006 through testing a variety of horizontal drilling techniques the company expects to better understand reservoir response and the economic viability of reserve development through horizontal drilling similarly through the ongoing infill pilot the company will evaluate the economic viability of accelerating production by down spacing coal bed methane wells  equitable supply believes that its 772 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within a reasonable time period currently estimated to be five years because equitable supply i completed substantially all of the wells it drilled in the last three years and ii developed proved undeveloped reserves of 60 bcfe and 70 bcfe during 2006 and 2005 respectively equitable supply’s plans include developing similar levels of proved undeveloped reserves going forward 

·   investing in midstream gathering and processing in the appalachian basin   infrastructure to support the company’s increased drilling to mitigate curtailments on and increase flexibility and reliability of gathering systems and to move gas from wellhead to market presents an acute need but also a significant opportunity for the company

·   through its equitrans affiliate the company is constructing the big sandy pipeline which will provide for a significant increase in midstream throughput capacity the company is also planning an upgrade to the companyoperated hydrocarbon processing plant in langley kentucky for completion in early 2008 the projects are projected to cost an aggregate of 191 million

·   the company plans to expand its gathering systems by approximately 200 miles of gathering line and approximately 25000 horsepower of compression in 2007 many of the existing gathering lines will be increased in size to handle these additional volumes and new gathering lines will be constructed to expanded drilling areas the company plans to build new compression stations as well as expand existing stations in order to transport gas to sales points on interstate pipelines

·   the company is also evaluating several other processing gathering line and compression expansion opportunities in appalachia and expects to invest in additional projects in 2007 and beyond

these efforts will assist the company to move not only its gas but also third party producer gas from wellhead to market 

other income statement items

·   proceeds of 1500 million from the issuance of notes in september 2005 

partially offset by 

·   less of an increase in amounts borrowed under shortterm loans in 2005 as compared to 2004 

the company believes that cash generated from operations amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position are more than adequate to meet the company’s reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements the company anticipates financing its capital expenditures and the pending acquisition of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc through a combination of debt equity and asset sales 

shortterm borrowings 

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices the company’s 15 billion fiveyear revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and other purposes including support of the company’s commercial paper program historically shortterm borrowings under the commercial paper program have been used mainly to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season due to decreased natural gas prices and increased margin deposit thresholds with financial institutions during 2006 and resulting decreases in the company’s net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements the company borrowed decreased amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its interestbearing margin deposits under its natural gas hedge agreements the amount of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2006 was 1360 million interest rates on these shortterm loans averaged 46 during 2006 

security ratings and financing triggers 

the table below reflects the current credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the company changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm and longterm debt and its access to the credit markets 

   

on march 2 2006 standard  poor’s ratings services placed the company’s short and longterm credit ratings on creditwatch with negative implications and moody’s investors service placed the ratings under review for possible downgrade these actions resulted from the company’s announcement that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc subject to antitrust and regulatory approvals the final ratings outcomes are expected to be determined after the acquisition financing plan has been reviewed by the ratings agencies and the regulatory approval process is near completion 

the company’s credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company’s ratings particularly below investment grade it may significantly limit the company’s access to the commercial paper market and borrowing costs would increase in addition the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings incur increased margin deposit requirements with respect to its hedging instruments and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease 

the company’s credit ratings on its noncreditenhanced senior unsecured longterm debt determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit the lower the company’s credit rating the higher the level of fees and interest rate as of december 31 2006 the company had no outstanding borrowings against these lines of credit the company pays facility fees to maintain credit availability 

the company’s debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that if not complied with could require early payment additional collateral support or similar actions the most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s current credit facility’s financial covenants require a total debttototal capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 the calculation of this ratio excludes accumulated other comprehensive income 

loss during an acquisition period which is defined as the period beginning with the funding of the purchase price for the stock of the peoples natural gas company and hope gas inc and ending on the first fiscal quarter end at least 365 days after the funding of such purchase price the covenant is relaxed from 65 to 70 as of december 31 2006 the company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants 

commodity risk management 

the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company’s risk management program includes the use of exchangetraded natural gas futures contracts and options and otc natural gas swap agreements and options collectively derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes the preponderance of derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are fixed price swaps or collars 

during 2006 the company increased its hedge position for 2007 through 2013 as a result the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s total hedge position for 2007 through 2009 are 

   

 the above price is based on a conversion rate of 105 mmbtumcf 

the company’s current hedged position provides price protection for a substantial portion of expected equity production for the years 2007 through 2009 and a significant portion of expected equity production for the years 2010 through 2013 the company’s exposure to a 010 change in average nymex natural gas price is approximately 001 per diluted share for 2007 and ranges from 001 to 003 per diluted share per year for 2008 and 2009 the company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices see note 3 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

investment securities 

the company’s availableforsale investments as of december 31 2006 and 2005 consist of approximately 313 million and 252 million respectively of equity securities that are intended to fund certain liabilities for which the company is selfinsured these investments are recorded at fair market value during 2005 the company sold all of its remaining 70 million shares of kerrmcgee in various transactions for total net pretax proceeds of 4605 million and a total pretax gain of 1103 million net of 958 million in costs associated with the termination of the three related variable share forward transactions entered into in june 2004 subsequent to the westportkerrmcgee merger 

other items 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company has a nonequity interest in a variable interest entity appalachian npi llc anpi in which equitable was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary as of december 31 2006 anpi had 214 million of total assets and 336 million of total liabilities including 137 million of longterm debt including current maturities excluding minority interest 

the company provides a liquidity reserve guarantee to anpi which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations and is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by the appalachian natural gas trust angt the company received a marketbased fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee as of december 31 2006 the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be approximately 50 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of fin 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance 

the company has entered into an agreement with angt to provide gathering and operating services to deliver angt’s gas to market in addition the company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered the revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately 168 million for 2006 

in connection with the sale of its noresco domestic business in 2005 the company agreed to maintain certain guarantees which benefit noresco these guarantees the majority of which predate the sale of noresco became offbalance sheet arrangements upon the closing of the sale of noresco these arrangements include guarantees of noresco’s obligations to the purchasers of certain of noresco’s contract receivables and agreements to maintain guarantees supporting noresco’s obligations under certain customer contracts in addition noresco and the purchaser agreed that noresco would fully perform its obligations under each underlying agreement and that the purchaser or noresco would reimburse the company for losses under the guarantees the purchaser’s obligations to reimburse the company are capped at 6 million the company determined that the likelihood the company will be required to perform on these arrangements is remote and as such the company has not recorded any liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees the total maximum potential obligation under these arrangements is estimated to be approximately 484 million as of december 31 2006 and decreases over time as the guarantees expire or the underlying obligations are fulfilled by noresco 

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s guarantees 

pension plans 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 which requires an employer to recognize a benefit plan’s funded status in its statement of financial position measure a benefit plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year and recognize the changes in the benefit plan’s funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur sfas no 158’s requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the new disclosure requirements were effective for the yearended december 31 2006 see footnote 13 for information regarding the adoption of sfas no 158 as of december 31 2006 

total pension expense recognized by the company in 2006 2005 and 2004 excluding special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses totaled 01 million 04 million and 04 million respectively the company recognized special termination benefits settlement losses and curtailment losses in 2006 2005 and 2004 of 30 million 184 million and 162 million respectively as a result of these costs the company’s projected benefit obligation decreased by approximately 360 million 

during the fourth quarter of 2006 the company recognized a settlement expense of approximately 27 million for an early retirement program 

during 2005 the company settled its pension obligation with the united steelworkers of america local union 12050 representing 182 employees as a result of this settlement the company recognized a settlement expense of 121 million during 2005 during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company settled its pension obligation with certain nonrepresented employees as a result of this settlement the company recognized a settlement expense of approximately 24 million in 2005 

effective december 31 2004 the company settled the pension obligation of those nonrepresented employees cash balance participants whose benefits were frozen as of december 31 2003 as a result of this settlement the company recognized settlement expense of 134 million in 2004 

the company made cash contributions of approximately 18 million and 204 million to its pension plan during 2006 and 2005 respectively as a result of the previously described settlements the company expects to make cash contributions of approximately 10 million to its pension plan during 2007 the company was not required to and consequently did not make any contribution to its pension plans during the year ended december 31 2004 

incentive compensation 

the company adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 which results in the company recognizing compensation cost for all forms of sharebased payments to employees including employee stock options as an expense in its income statement the company previously applied apb no 25 in accounting for its sharebased compensation and consequently did not recognize any compensation cost for its stock option awards the company’s estimate of compensation cost for stock options is based on the use of the blackscholes optionpricing model the blackscholes model is considered a “theoretical” or probability model used to estimate the price an option would sell for in the market today the company does not represent that this method yields an exact value of what an unrelated third party ie the market would be willing to pay to acquire such options 

the company adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method under which the company recorded compensation expense for its unvested stock options beginning january 1 2006 as such the company did not restate any prior period income statement amounts in addition the adoption of sfas no 123r did not result in any significant changes to the company’s method for valuing its stock options from that previously used for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 

the adoption of sfas no 123r did not have a significant impact on the company’s operating results for 2006 as the company has shifted its compensation focus to the issuance of performancebased units and timerestricted stock awards for which it already recognized compensation expense under generally accepted accounting principles management and the board of directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach more closely aligns management’s incentives with shareholder rewards than is the case with traditional stock options no new stock options have been awarded since 2003 all stock options granted subsequent to 2003 have comprised options granted for reload rights associated with previouslyawarded options 

the company recorded approximately 10 million of compensation expense related to stock options in 2006 the majority of which related to stock option reloads which immediately vested under the terms of the related stock option award agreements the majority of the company’s previously issued stock options were already vested at the time of adoption of sfas no 123r and associated compensation expense yet to be recognized was insignificant all stock options outstanding as of december 31 2006 are fully vested and as such the company does not anticipate incurring any additional compensation expense related to currently outstanding stock options 

had compensation cost been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for prior periods’ stock option grants consistent with the methodology prescribed in sfas no 123r net income would have been reduced by an estimated 15 million or approximately 001 per diluted share for 2005 and an estimated 42 million or approximately 004 per diluted share for 2004 

the company recorded the following incentive compensation expense in continuing operations for the periods indicated below 

   

the longterm incentive compensation expenses are primarily associated with executive performance incentive programs “the programs” that were instituted starting in 2002 the longterm incentive compensation expenses during 2006 were lower than during 2005 due to a greater number of unvested units outstanding during 2005 than during 2006 as there were two programs in effect during 2005 and only one in 2006 the longterm incentive compensation expenses during 2005 were higher than during 2004 primarily due to a higher estimated share price for the programs being expensed as a result of the company’s share price appreciation and a greater number of unvested units outstanding during 2005 than during 2004 

the company currently estimates 2007 total incentive compensation expense of approximately 38 million 

federal legislation 

during 2005 the company completed its review of the american jobs creation act of 2004’s impact on the company’s executive compensation plans and the compensation committee of the company’s board of directors decided to end the company’s deferred compensation programs for employees as a result in 2005 the company recorded 153 million in tax benefit disallowances under section 162m of the irc primarily due to the impairment of previously recorded deferred tax assets related to the employee deferred compensation programs and the 2003 executive performance incentive program 

rate regulation 

the company’s distribution operations and pipeline operations are subject to various forms of regulation as previously discussed accounting for the company’s regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 71 as described in notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

schedule of contractual obligations 

the following table details the future projected payments associated with the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

   

included within the purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately 378 million relating to the company’s natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing longterm contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to ten years approximately 264 million of these costs are believed to be recoverable in customer rates 

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as a limited amount of equipment the relocation of the company to a new corporate headquarters in 2005 resulted in the early termination of several operating leases for facilities deemed to have no economic benefit to the company these obligations which totaled 66 million as of december 31 2006 are included in operating lease obligations detailed above 

the other longterm liabilities line represents the total estimated payout for the 2005 executive performance incentive program see section titled “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of this obligation 

contingent liabilities and commitments 

the various regulatory authorities that oversee equitable’s operations will from time to time make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the company it is the company’s policy to comply with applicable laws and cooperate when regulatory bodies make requests 

in june 2006 the west virginia supreme court of appeals issued a decision involving interpretation of certain types of oil and gas leases of an unrelated party in which a class of royalty owners in the state of west virginia filed a lawsuit claiming that the defendant in the case underpaid royalties by deducting certain postproduction costs not permitted by such types of leases and not paying a fair value for the gas produced from the royalty owners’ leases in january 2007 the jury in the aforementioned case returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff royalty owners awarding the plaintiffs significant compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged underpayment of royalties while the defendant plans to appeal the verdict this decision may ultimately impact other royalty interest rights in west virginia claims have been brought against others in the oil and gas industry including the company the actions against the company are in the early stages of proceedings the company believes that the claims and facts decided in the unrelated lawsuit can be differentiated from those asserted against the company nevertheless the company has reviewed its west virginia royalty agreements and established a reserve it believes to be appropriate 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s contingent liabilities and commitments 

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon equitable’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies which were reviewed and approved by the company’s audit committee relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

provision for doubtful accounts   the company encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable equitable gas’s state regulated relationship with its customers is particularly complex equitable gas records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision equitable gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable “writeoffs” as a percentage of total revenue this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis and is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather both of these items ultimately impact the customers’ ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the passthrough of purchased gas costs to the customers management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time 

the monthly provision for uncollectible accounts amounted to approximately 1 and 2 of residential sales for 2006 and 2005 respectively beginning in april 2004 the company began collecting a regulatory surcharge in the amount of 030 per mcfe of gas sold to residential customers to help recover the costs associated with providing gas service to lowincome customers this surcharge is credited to the reserve for uncollectible accounts and reduces the amount which would otherwise be recognized as bad debt expense this surcharge totaled 55 million in 2006 65 million in 2005 and 33 million in 2004 in addition during 2004 equitable gas implemented a new customer information and billing system that has enabled the company to better segment customer information in order to identify customers who may have difficulty paying also under the responsible utility customer protection act equitable gas is permitted to send winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250 of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the pa puc the company took advantage of these winter terminations in an effort to reduce its uncollectible accounts receivable 

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts are “critical accounting estimates” because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the changes in the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital the actual weather commodity prices and other internal and external economic conditions such as the mix of the customer base between residential commercial and industrial may vary significantly from management’s assumptions and may impact the ultimate collectibility of customer accounts additionally the regulatory environment allows certain customers to enter into longterm payment arrangements the ultimate collectibility of which is difficult to determine 

executive performance incentive programs the company treats its executive performance incentive programs as variable plans the actual cost to be recorded for the 2005 executive performance incentive program 2005 program will not be known until the measurement date which is december 31 2008 requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized the number of units to be paid out under the 2005 program is dependent upon a combination of a level of total shareholder return relative to the performance of a peer group and the company’s average absolute return on capital during the fouryear performance period the company reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual for the 2005 program when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the value of the ultimate payout in the current period the company estimated that the performance measures would be met at 175 of the full value of the units for the 2005 program and that the estimated end of 2008 share price would be 4500

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the 2005 program is a “critical accounting estimate” because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the company’s shares and the performance of the peer group additionally the impact on net income of these changes could be material management’s assumptions about future stock price and company performance relative to the peer group requires significant judgment each company’s inherent volatility combined with the volatility in commodity prices impact the ultimate amount of the payout and make it difficult to provide sensitivity metrics to demonstrate what impact a change in the company’s stock price will have on the estimate however assuming no change in the attainment of performance measures a 10 increase in the company’s stock price assumptions for december 31 2008 would result in an increase in 2007 compensation expense under the 2005 program of approximately 6 million a 10 decrease in the company’s stock price assumptions would result in a decrease in 2007 compensation expense of the same amount 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse see note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from marktomarket hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss deferred revenues and expenses and state net operating loss carryforwards the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized the company also recorded a 01 million charge in 2006 and a 153 million charge in 2005 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain executive compensation plans as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under section 162m of the irc no other valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets any change in the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed evidence used includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement 

contingencies  the company is involved in various regulatory and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business the company records a liability for contingencies based upon its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the recording of contingencies is guided by the principles of sfas no 5 the company considers many factors in making these assessments including history and specifics of each matter estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to contingencies is a “critical accounting estimate” because future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company’s assumptions 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

derivative commodity instruments 

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through the equitable supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the equitable utilities segment the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 of this form 10k the company uses nonleveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

commodity price risk 

the following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential effect on fair value or future earnings from derivative commodity instruments due to a 10 increase and a 10 decrease in commodity prices 

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk the financial instruments currently utilized by the company include futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity the company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted in general the company’s strategy is to hedge production at prices considered to be favorable to the company the company attempts to take advantage of price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when market prices move above historical averages and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below these levels the goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility to the extent that the company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price the company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas 

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2006 the company hedged portions of expected equity production through 2013 by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 3101 bcf of natural gas see the “commodity risk management” and “capital resources and liquidity” sections of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k for further discussion for the sensitivity analysis set forth below the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a model similar to its normal change in fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2006 the price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s balance sheet resulting in the change in fair value 

a hypothetical decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2006 levels would increase the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 2223 million a hypothetical increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2006 levels would decrease the fair value of nontrading natural gas derivative instruments by approximately 2218 million 

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks 

within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

for derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes the company engages in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits the financial instruments currently utilized by the company for trading purposes include forward contracts and swap agreements 

a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2006 levels would not have a significant impact on the fair value of derivative commodity instruments held by the company for trading purposes as of december 31 2006 

other market risks 

the company has variable rate shortterm debt as such there is some exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the company under its current capital structure the company maintains fixed rate longterm debt that is not subject to risk exposure from fluctuating interest rates 

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value the company believes that nymextraded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties the company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the company’s criteria for credit and liquidity strength

equitable resources inc is an integrated energy company with an emphasis on appalachian area natural gas supply activities including production and gathering and natural gas distribution and transmission the company and its subsidiaries offer energy natural gas and a limited amount of natural gas liquids and crude oil products and services to wholesale and retail customers through two business segments equitable utilities and equitable supply in december 2005 the company discontinued and sold the operations of its noresco segment which provides energy efficiency solutions to customers including governmental military institutional commercial and industrial endusers 

  

the company was formed under the laws of pennsylvania by the consolidation and merger in 1925 of two constituent companies the older of which was organized in 1888 in 1984 the corporate name was changed to equitable resources inc 

  

the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1250 employees at the end of 2005 of which 364 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements although one union representing 13 employees has been operating without a contract since april 19 2004 the company believes that its employee relations are generally good

business segments 

  

equitable utilities 

  

equitable utilities’ operations comprise the gathering transportation storage distribution and sale of natural gas equitable utilities has both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated group consists of the company’s federallyregulated pipeline and storage operations and the stateregulated distribution operations while the nonregulated group is involved in the nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas risk management activities for the company and the sale of energyrelated products and services equitable utilities generated approximately 34 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2005 

  

distribution operations 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution operations are carried out by equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as farm tap service in eastern kentucky and west virginia the distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 274400 customers comprising 255600 residential customers and 18800 commercial and industrial customers equitable gas purchases gas through supply contracts from various sources including major and independent producers in the gulf coast local producers in the appalachian area and gas marketers including an affiliate equitable gas’ supply purchases include various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution rates terms of service contracts with affiliates and issuance of securities are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the public service commission of west virginia the field line sales rates in kentucky are also subject to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania which is not subject to comprehensive regulation 

  

in most cases the company must seek approval of one or more of these regulatory bodies prior to increasing or decreasing its rates currently equitable gas passes through to its regulated customers the cost of its purchased gas and is allowed to recover a return in addition to its costs of operations however the company’s regulators do not guarantee recovery and may require that certain costs of operation be recovered over an extended term equitable gas has worked with and continues to work with regulators to implement alternative performancebased rates equitable gas’ tariffs for industrial and commercial customers allow for negotiated rates in appropriate circumstances equitable gas has not filed a rate case since 1997 and its predominant approach to maximizing profits is cost control regulators periodically audit the company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements the company is not aware of any significant noncompliance as a result of any completed audits 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 72 of calendar year 2005 revenues occurring during the winter heating season the months of january february march november and december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during offpeak season to accommodate higher demand during the winter heating season 

  

the distribution operations’ service territory is a relatively small geographic area with a high percentage of gas users within a static population and economy management believes there are limited continuing growth opportunities in the service area where competition exists with two other major local distribution companies 

  

pipeline transportation and storage operations 

  

equitable utilities’ interstate pipeline operations are carried out by equitrans lp equitrans these operations offer gas gathering transportation storage and related services to affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and amerada hess corporation in 2005 approximately 76 of transportation volumes and approximately 80 of transportation revenues were from affiliates 

  

  

equitrans’ rates are subject to regulation by the ferc throughout 2004 and 2005 equitrans has filed multiple rate case applications with the ferc which have been consolidated and seek to resolve several issues including establishing an appropriate return on the company’s capital investments the company’s pension funding levels and accruing for postretirement benefits other than pensions a comprehensive and unopposed settlement to the consolidated rate case was submitted to the ferc on december 9 2005 the settlement if approved by the ferc will allow the company to fully recover its cost of providing service including the recovery of fuel and lost and unaccountedfor gas provide for the replenishment of migrated storage base gas increase service flexibility and improve the company’s ability to recover costs associated with maintaining pipeline integrity equitrans began charging the proposed rates subject to refund during the second half of 2004 consistent with orders issued by the ferc accordingly equitrans has established a reserve which will be adjusted upon ultimate resolution of the consolidated rate case the company is awaiting a ferc order with respect to the settlement while the company expects that approval of the settlement agreement as filed will enable the company to realize benefits in the future the immediate impact on pipeline operating income is not expected to be significant 

  

while all of equitrans’ firm transportation contracts are currently set to expire in either 2006 or 2007 the company anticipates that the majority of the related volumes will be fully subscribed and therefore any resulting decrease in operating income is not expected to be significant 

  

energy marketing 

  

equitable utilities’ unregulated marketing operations include the nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas at equitable gas marketing and risk management activities at equitable energy llc equitable energy and the sale of energyrelated products and services by equitable homeworks llc services and products offered by the marketing operations include commodity procurement delivery and storage risk management and customer services for energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers equitable energy also engages in trading and risk management activities for the company the objective of these activities is to limit the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and to optimize the use of the company’s assets 

  

the marketing operations are subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission the ferc and the pa puc 

  

equitable supply 

  

equitable supply’s production business develops produces and sells natural gas and to a limited extent crude oil and natural gas liquids in the appalachian region of the united states its gathering business consists of gathering the company’s and third party gas and the processing of natural gas liquids equitable supply generated approximately 66 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2005 

  

production 

  

equitable supply’s production business operating through equitable production company and several smaller affiliates collectively referred to as “equitable production” is among the largest owners of proved natural gas reserves in the appalachian basin equitable production currently operates approximately 12000 producing wells in the appalachian basin 

  

the company’s reserves are located entirely in the appalachian basin the appalachian basin is characterized by wells with comparatively low rates of annual decline in production wells generally produce for periods longer than 50 years low production costs per well and high energy content once drilled and completed wells in the appalachian basin typically have low ongoing operating and maintenance requirements many of the company’s wells have been producing for decades and in some cases since the early 1900’s management believes that virtually all of the company’s wells are low risk development wells in part because they are drilled in areas known to be relatively productive and to relatively shallow depths ranging from 1000 to 7000 feet below the surface many of these wells are completed in more than one producing formation including coal formations in certain areas and production from these formations may be commingled 

  

  

in 2005 equitable production drilled 455 gross wells 345 net wells at a success rate of nearly 100 drilling was concentrated within equitable’s core areas of southwestern virginia southeastern kentucky and southern west virginia this activity resulted in an average of 172 mmcf per day of gas sales and proved developed reserve additions of approximately 100 bcfe the 100 bcfe of proved developed reserve additions include approximately 30 bcfe of proved developed extensions discoveries and other additions that were not previously classified as undeveloped the remaining 70 bcfe of proved developed reserve additions relate to proved undeveloped reserves that were transferred to proved developed reserves 

  

equitable supply does not actively engage in activities to differentiate its products and therefore receives marketbased pricing the market price for gas located in the appalachian basin is generally higher than the price for gas located in the gulf coast however because of the relative differences in the supply of and demand for natural gas in those areas and in the relative cost to transport to customers in the northeastern united states as a consequence equitable production’s location provides a price advantage over companies located in the gulf coast region of the country 

  

the company has noticed some relative value erosion of midatlantic basis as a result of new base load gas supplies if the rate of supply growth in appalachia exceeds the midatlantic region’s growth in demand there may be further weakening in basis especially in the summer months at this time this erosion has not had a significant impact on the company’s results 

  

the combination of longlived production low drilling costs high drilling completion rates at shallow depths and proximity to natural gas markets has resulted in a highly fragmented operating environment in the appalachian basin natural gas drilling activity has increased as suppliers in the appalachian basin attempt to take advantage of higher than normal natural gas prices while increased activity can place constraints on capacity of labor equipment pipeline availability and other resources in the appalachian basin it also provides opportunities for expansion of natural gas gathering activities and potential for higher quality rigs and labor providers in the future 

  

equitable supply hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production and third party purchases and sales at specified prices for a specified period of time the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments are outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

gathering 

  

equitable gathering derives its revenues from charges it assesses to customers on a gathering and production pipeline system in the appalachian basin as of december 31 2005 the system included approximately 8500 miles of pipeline located throughout west virginia eastern kentucky southwestern virginia and portions of pennsylvania over 80 of the volumes through the pipeline system interconnect with three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans the company’s interstate transmission affiliate that affords access to natural gas markets in southwestern pennsylvania and the northeastern united states maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to multiple markets and the flexibility to redirect deliveries when flow interruptions occur 

  

gathered sales volumes for 2005 totaled 1210 bcf of which approximately 57 related to the gathering of equitable production’s sales volumes 34 related to third party volumes and the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company continued to operate for a fee approximately 80 of the company’s 2005 gathering revenues were from affiliates effective january 1 2005 the company reorganized its businesses in order to better identify the operating and capital costs associated with the gathering business the information derived from this reorganization and upward pressure on operating costs resulting from the expansion of activity in the appalachian basin have led equitable gathering to determine that it is in many cases currently charging gathering rates which are below its cost of service equitable gathering will pursue full recovery of its costs of providing services by increasing the rates charged to its customers 

  

certain portions of the gathering system are subject to rate regulation by the ferc and the company has sought to have rates established for those gathering systems as part of the consolidated rate case described under 

  

  

“equitable utilities – pipeline transportation and storage operations” the consolidated rate case includes the operations of gathering facilities that were recorded in equitable supply’s gathering operations during 2005 2004 and 2003 effective january 1 2006 these gathering systems which consist of 1400 miles of pipeline and related facilities with approximately 133 bcf of annual throughput were transferred to equitable utilities for segment reporting purposes the effect of the transfer is not material to the results of operations or financial position of the equitable utilities or equitable supply segments segment results have not been restated for this transfer 

  

competition in natural gas gathering is based mainly on gathering system capacity price and location key competitors in equitable supply’s gathering operations include independent gas gatherers and integrated appalachian energy companies see “outlook” under equitable supply’s section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for discussion of the company’s strategy in regards to its midstream gathering operations 

  

discontinued operations 

  

in december 2005 the company sold the domestic operations of its noresco business segment for 82 million before customary purchase price adjustments of 2 million which resulted in the company receiving 80 million of proceeds in december 2005 for this sale the sales price is also subject to future customary purchase price adjustments per the terms of the agreement also in december 2005 the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement subject to closing conditions to sell the remaining interest in its investment in igceri panam thermal generating limited for 25 million this sale is expected to close in 2006 and as such the company considers the investment to be held for sale as a result of these transactions the company has reclassified its financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the operating results of the noresco segment as discontinued operations

 item 1a risk factors   risks relating to our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business please note that additional risks not presently known to the company or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on the company’s business and operations 

  

natural gas price volatility may have an adverse effect on our revenue profitability and liquidity 

  

our revenue profitability and liquidity depend on the price and demand for natural gas the markets for natural gas are volatile and fluctuations in prices will affect our financial results recently natural gas prices have increased substantially such price increases have subjected us and may continue to subject us to margin calls which require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties the cash collateral which is interestbearing provided to our hedge counterparties is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices depending on the amount of such reduction or in whole upon settlement of the related hedged transaction increases in natural gas prices may also be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs increased deferral of purchased gas costs for our distribution operations increased production taxes increased lease operating expenses increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from our distribution customers and increased customer conservation or conversion to alternative fuels lower natural gas prices increases in our estimates of development costs or changes to our production assumptions may result in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and incur noncash charges to earnings natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control which include weather conditions the supply of and demand for natural gas national and worldwide economic and political conditions the price and availability of alternative fuels the proximity to and availability of capacity on transportation facilities and government regulations such as regulation of natural gas transportation royalties and price controls 

  

we are dependent on our ability to costeffectively access capital markets our inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms may adversely affect our business a reduction in our debt issuer credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs 

  

we rely on access to both shortterm debt markets and longerterm capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy our capital requirements in excess of cash flow from our operations each of the agencies who periodically assign credit ratings on our debt has stated that our rating is based on their expectations with respect to certain financial performance measures and ratios a rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency any inability to maintain our current credit ratings could affect especially during times of uncertainty in the capital markets our ability to raise capital on favorable terms which in turn could impact our ability to manage our business any downgrades in these ratings could have a negative impact on our liquidity our access to capital markets and our costs of financing and could increase the amount of collateral required by our hedge counterparties capital market disruptions could also adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets 

  

our need to comply with comprehensive complex and sometimes unpredictable government regulations may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth which may result in reduced earnings 

  

significant portions of our gathering transportation storage and distribution businesses are subject to state and federal regulation including regulation of the rates which we may assess our customers the agencies that regulate our rates may prohibit us from realizing a level of return which we believe is appropriate these restrictions may take the form of imputed revenue credits cost disallowances including purchased gas cost recoveries andor expense deferrals additionally we may be required to provide additional assistance to low income residential customers to help pay their bills 

  

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of 

  

  

hazardous substances and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed pipeline safety and work practices related to employee health and safety complying with these requirements could have a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position 

  

the rates of federal state and local taxes applicable to the industries in which we operate including production taxes paid by equitable supply which often fluctuate could be increased by the respective taxing authorities in addition the tax laws rules and regulations that affect our business could change any such increase or change could adversely impact our cash flows and profitability 

  

the actual quantities and present value of our proved gas reserves may prove to be lower than we have estimated which could negatively impact our longterm growth prospects 

  

the proved gas reserve information included in this form 10k represents only estimates calculated using gas prices in effect on the date indicated in the reports any significant price changes will have a material effect on the present value of our reserves for example an increase in gas prices of approximately 050 per mcfe from those prices used to calculate our reserves would increase the present value of our proved reserves by approximately 322 million and the same decrease in gas prices would decrease the present value of our proved reserves by the same amount 

  

estimating underground accumulations of gas involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological geophysical engineering and economic data for each reservoir future economic and operating conditions are uncertain which could cause a revision to our future reserve estimates estimates of economically recoverable gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions including historical production from the area compared with production from other comparable producing areas and the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies some of these assumptions including the 10 discount factor used to calculate discounted future net reserves in this form 10k are required by the sec 

  

because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves the quantities of gas that are ultimately recovered the timing of the recovery of gas reserves the production and operating costs incurred the amount and timing of future development expenditures and the gas price received 

  

the amount and timing of actual future gas production and the cost and timing of our infrastructure development program are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates which may reduce our earnings 

  

our future success depends on our ability to develop additional gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to transport the production from those reserves to market and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings in 2005 we expanded our drilling program and we have subsequently announced further expansion we have also announced a significant investment in transportation infrastructure the big sandy pipeline which is intended to address a lack of capacity on and access to existing transportation pipelines as well as curtailments on such pipelines our drilling of development wells and our infrastructure development program can involve significant risks including those related to timing and cost overruns and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital leases rigs and a qualified work force as well as weather conditions gas price volatility government approvals title problems geology and other factors in addition we may not be able to obtain sufficient third party transportation contracts to recover the costs of our infrastructure development program drilling for natural gas can be unprofitable not only from dry wells but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit without continued successful development or acquisition activities our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 

  

our operations are weather sensitive 

  

weather conditions directly influence the demand for natural gas affect the price of energy commodities and may hinder our gathering transportation and drilling operations for example mild winter temperatures can cause a 

  

  

decrease in the volume or affect the price of gas we sell in any year and colder winter temperatures can cause an increase in the amount or in the price of gas we sell in any year in addition severe weather including hurricanes can be destructive causing natural gas prices to be volatile our drilling operations to be curtailed delayed or canceled our gathering and transportation assets to be damaged and our operating expenses to increase 

  

we are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

equitable’s consolidated income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2005 was 2586 million or 209 per diluted share compared with 2988 million or 237 per diluted share for 2004 and 1658 million or 131 per diluted share for 2003 

  

the 402 million decrease in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change from 2004 to 2005 was primarily the result of several nonoperational factors the company recorded a gain in 2004 as a result of the westport resources corporation westportkerrmcgee corporation kerrmcgee merger in the second quarter of 2004 as well as a gain on the sale of 08 million kerrmcgee shares subsequent to the merger these gains were partially offset by an expense related to the company’s charitable contribution of 04 million kerrmcgee shares to the equitable resources foundation inc a communitygiving foundation in 2004 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2005 included a significant gain from the sale of all of the company’s remaining kerrmcgee shares which partially offset the impact of the 2004 items the net impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change of these four items was a 917 million decrease from 2004 to 2005 

  

operating income increased 541 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of higher realized selling prices an increase in sales volumes from production and increased revenues from storage asset optimization opportunities these increases were offset in some part by increased operating costs resulting primarily from higher natural gas prices and sales volumes increased incentive expenses and impairment charges related to the company’s office consolidation 

  

the company’s effective tax rate for its continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2005 was 372 compared to 342 for both the year ended december 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 the increase in the company’s effective tax rate was primarily the result of tax benefit disallowances under section 162m of the irc see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the 2004 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased from 2003 primarily due to the gain related to the westportkerrmcgee merger higher realized selling prices an increase in sales volumes from production and the proceeds received from an insurance settlement also helped to improve 2004 earnings the improved 2004 earnings were partially offset by an increase in incentive expenses the costs to settle the cash balance portion of a defined benefit pension plan in 2004 decreased gains from the sale of availableforsale securities in 2004 as compared to 2003 an increase over the prior year in charitable foundation contribution expense the loss on a 2004 amendment of the company’s prepaid forward contract and warmer weather in 2004 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments minority interest and other income net interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive costs pension costs and administrative costs totaling 480 million 458 million and 204 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively were not allocated to business segments the increase in unallocated expenses from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to increased longterm incentive expenses 

  

the company has reconciled each segment’s operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments excluding westport minority interest and other income net to the company’s consolidated operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments excluding westport minority interest and other income net totals in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements additionally these subtotals are reconciled to the company’s consolidated net income in note 2 the company has also reported the components of each segment’s 

  

  

operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived equitable’s management believes that presentation of this information is useful to management and investors in assessing the financial condition operations and trends of each of equitable’s segments without being obscured by the financial condition operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes 

  

equitable utilities 

  

overview 

  

equitable gas continues to work with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performancebased rate making performancebased incentives provide an opportunity for equitable gas to make shortterm releases of unutilized pipeline capacity or “capacity releases” for a fee or to participate in the bundling of gas supply and pipeline capacity for “offsystem” sales an “offsystem” sale involves the purchase and delivery of gas to a customer at mutually agreedupon points on facilities not owned by the company equitable gas’ performancebased purchased gas cost credit incentive and a second pa pucapproved performancebased initiative related to balancing services were available through september 2005 effective september 30 2005 an opinion and order issued by the pa puc modified the performancebased purchased gas cost credit design on a prospective basis providing equitable gas with a 25 sharing level of capacity releases and offsystem sales and terminating the company’s balancing service performancebased incentive equitable gas has filed a petition for reconsideration and clarification with the pa puc and is awaiting a final order 

  

the gas cost rates effective for equitable gas’s residential and commercial customers beginning october 1 2005 include then current high natural gas commodity prices resulting in residential rates as much as 40 higher than those in place in 2004 these increases can present a significant challenge to the company’s lowincome customers especially during the winter months the company is working with federal and state government officials industry associations and local foundations to identify sources of funds to assist low income customers in paying their heating bills in december 2005 equitable resources foundation inc made a grant of 1 million to the local dollar energy fund a nonprofit organization which assists lowincome consumers in paying their heating bills in addition the company announced the creation of a new 1 million help grant program which it manages internally to provide additional assistance to lowincome consumers for the december 2005 through march 2006 winter heating season approximately 03 million of this amount was credited to eligible customers’ accounts during december 2005 in december 2005 the pa puc approved equitable gas’s petition requesting approval to use up to 7 million of pipeline supplier refunds to benefit lowincome customers in its service territory under programs designed and managed by equitable gas the funds are being used to assist lowincome customers in reestablishing and maintaining their service during the 20052006 winter heating season additionally pennsylvania governor rendell proposed and the state legislature approved 19 million in state funding for low income home energy assistance program “liheap” grants to be administered by the pennsylvania department of public welfare the company will closely monitor its collections rates and adjust its reserve for uncollectible accounts as necessary 

  

the responsible utility customer protection act which became effective on december 14 2004 established new procedures for pennsylvania utilities regarding collection activities with respect to deposits payment plans and terminations for residential customers and is intended to help utility companies collect amounts due from customers as a result beginning in 2005 the company was permitted to begin sending winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250 of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the pa puc in 2005 the company sent termination notices to a number of eligible customers and will continue to utilize this mechanism in order to reduce delinquent accounts receivable from customers who have the ability to pay 

  

  

results of operations 

  

   

  

   

fiscal year ended december 31 2005 vs december 31 2004 

  

equitable utilities’ operating income totaled 983 million for 2005 compared to 1081 million for 2004 net operating income for 2005 included 160 million in charges for the termination and settlement of defined benefit pension plans and a 38 million impairment charge in connection with the company’s office consolidation 

  

net operating revenues were 2534 million for 2005 compared to 2427 million for 2004 the 107 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to increased marketing net operating revenues of 142 million resulting primarily from increased storage asset opportunities realized in a high and increasingly volatile natural gas commodity price environment distribution operations’ net operating revenues decreased 22 million due to decreased volumes distribution operations’ residential sales and transportation volumes decreased 840 mmcf from 2004 to 2005 due to decreased base load and lower customer use per degree day these reductions resulted from increased customer conservation more timely termination of nonpaying customers in 2005 and other factors increased volumes as a result of colder weather partially offset these decreases in residential volumes as heating degree days were 5543 in 2005 which was 3 colder than the 5360 heating degree days in 2004 although still warmer than normal distribution operations’ commercial and industrial volumes decreased 4229 mmcf from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a reduction in industrial throughput to two major steelmaking customers these high volume industrial sales have very low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues pipeline operations’ net operating revenues decreased 13 million from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a 38 million loss on fuel and retention in excess of the current rates this loss was partially offset by increased revenues earned in loaning and parking services these services are contracted on an asavailable basis as opposed to longterm firm storage contracts this flexibility allows customers including the company’s marketing affiliate to take advantage of the pipeline’s available storage to secure future supply at favorable prices these services were heavily subscribed in 2005 as higher volatility in natural gas prices provided substantial value for storage options 

  

operating expenses totaled 1551 million for 2005 compared to 1346 million for 2004 operating expenses for 2005 included 160 million in charges related to the termination and settlement of certain defined benefit pension plans and a 38 million loss related to the impairment of certain leased offices furniture and equipment in connection with the company’s relocation into its new consolidated office space excluding these 

  

  

items operating expenses increased 07 million which resulted from increases of 23 million in depreciation expense 22 million in incentive compensation 14 million in customer operations expenses and 11 million in employee benefit costs largely offset by decreases of 47 million in bad debt expense and 14 million in insurance costs the increased depreciation expense is a result of increased capital spending in equitable utilities over the past two years and is primarily related to computer hardware and software distribution mainline and service line replacements and the installation of automated meter reading devices the improvements in bad debt expense are a result of the more timely termination of nonpaying customers a full year impact of a 030 per mcf regulatory surcharge instituted in april 2004 improved efforts to obtain alternative funding for low income customers and other improvements in the collections process these improvements were offset somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2005 by high commodity rates and cold weather which resulted in increased provisions for bad debt in that period compared to the prior year 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2004 vs december 31 2003 

  

equitable utilities’ operating income totaled 1081 million for 2004 compared to 1099 million for 2003 the 18 million decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in net operating revenues resulting from warmer weather in 2004 

  

net operating revenues were 2427 million for 2004 compared to 2451 million for 2003 the 24 million decrease in net operating revenues was primarily due to warmer weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2004 heating degree days were 5360 in 2004 which was 6 warmer than the 5695 heating degree days in 2003 additionally in february 2004 a rate moratorium for west virginia customers expired as a result the distribution operations subsequently returned to normal gas recovery rates which led to a decrease in net operating revenues of 09 million for the full year 2004 such decreases for the distribution operations were partially offset by increased gathering revenue at the distribution and pipeline operations and higher storage related margins at the pipeline operations distributions operations’ residential sales and transportation volumes decreased 1742 mmcf from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the warmer weather distributions operations’ commercial and industrial volumes increased 813 mmcf from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to increases in sales to steel industry customers partially offset by reductions in volumes sold to institutional and manufacturing customers and the effects of warmer weather the increased highvolume steel industry sales have low unit margins and did not significantly impact total net operating revenues 

  

operating expenses totaled 1346 million for 2004 compared to 1352 million for 2003 this 06 million decrease was the result of several factors dda decreased 20 million primarily due to a 35 million adjustment related to increases in the estimated useful life for equitable gas’ main lines and services lines resulting from a pa puc mandated asset service life study this decrease was partially offset by increases in dda related mainly to increased capital in 2004 of which approximately 05 million was related to the implementation of a customer information system sga was relatively consistent between years with several offsetting fluctuations bad debt expense decreased by 17 million from 2003 to 2004 due to a reduction of a regulatory asset reserve of 75 million in 2004 partially offset by an increase of 58 million mainly related to delays in initiating collection activity due to the implementation of a customer information system in 2004 as well as increased gas rates in that year the reduction in the regulatory asset reserve was due to equitable gas having higher than anticipated recoveries for the delinquency reduction opportunity program through payment and rates offsetting this and other reductions in sga the distribution operations experienced increased insurance and legal costs of 17 million a 09 million increase in pennsylvania franchise tax 07 million of expense incurred primarily related to increased overtime and contractor costs as a result of the flooding which occurred in september 2004 due to hurricane ivan and other slight increases in administrative expense accruals o  m costs increased primarily as a result of 11 million related to the implementation of the customer information system

outlook 

  

equitable utilities’ business strategy is focused on effectively managing its gas distribution assets optimizing its return on assets selectively growing its gas distribution business through acquisition and developing a portfolio 

  

  

of closely related unregulated businesses with an emphasis on risk management and earnings viability key elements of equitable utilities’ strategy include 

  

•   enhancing the value and growth potential of the regulated utility operations equitable utilities will seek to enhance the value and growth of its existing utility assets by managing its capital spending effectively establishing a reputation for excellent customer service continuing to leverage technology working to achieve authorized returns in each jurisdiction and in those jurisdictions where it has performancebased rates sharing the benefits with its customers and maintaining earnings and rate stability through regulatory arrangements that fairly balance the interests of customers and shareholders 

  

•   selectively evaluating acquisitions the company will selectively examine and evaluate the acquisition of natural gas distribution gas pipeline or other gasrelated assets the company’s acquisition criteria include the ability to generate operational synergies strategic fit relative to the company’s core competencies value from nearterm earnings contributions and adequate returns on invested capital 

  

•   selectively expanding equitable utilities natural gas storage and gathering operations the company intends to continue to expand its natural gas storage and gathering businesses to provide disciplined incremental earnings growth for shareholders in its asset management business equitable utilities intends to grow its business by providing its customers with gas supply storage and asset management options capturing value from increased natural gas gathering margins providing producers with access to markets for their increased production and arbitraging pipeline and storage assets across various gas markets and time horizons in its underground storage business equitable utilities will continue to invest capital to expand its operational capabilities by increasing storage deliverability thereby providing an opportunity to capture increased value from the volatility in natural gas prices capturing this value from equitable utilities’ storage assets may increase the volatility of reported earnings from this business equitable utilities will continue to focus on marketing energy to customers from its own assets controlling costs and managing its portfolio with smart business decisions while looking for additional opportunities to provide economical storage services in the regions in which the company’s utilities operate 

  

equitable supply 

  

overview 

  

sale of gas properties 

  

in may 2005 the company sold certain noncore gas properties and associated gathering assets for proceeds of approximately 142 million after purchase price adjustments the unit of production depletion rate or dda rate decreased by 004 per mcfe prospectively as a result of this transaction in accordance with sfas no 19 this sale of only a portion of the gas properties was treated as a normal retirement with no gain or loss recognized as doing so did not significantly affect the dda rate 

  

purchase of interest in eastern seven partners lp esp 

  

in january 2005 the company purchased the limited partnership interest in esp for cash of 575 million and assumed liabilities of 473 million production related to this interest during 2005 totaled approximately 82 bcf the dda rate increased by 004 per mcfe prospectively as a result of this transaction 

  

  

results of operations 

  

   

  

   

a   2005 capital expenditures include 575 million for the acquisition of the limited partnership interest in esp 2003 capital expenditures include 442 million for the purchase of the remaining 31 limited partnership interest in appalachian basin partners lp abp 

  

b   natural gas and oil production represents the company’s interest in gas and oil production measured at the wellhead it is equal to the sum of total sales volumes company usage line loss and natural gas inventory usage net 

  

c   revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect process and deliver natural gas from the field to the trunk or main transmission line many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price in which case the company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components 

  

d   production taxes include severance and productionrelated ad valorem and other property taxes 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2005 vs december 31 2004 

  

equitable supply’s operating income totaled 2936 million for 2005 compared to 2274 million for 2004 an increase of 662 million between years production operating income increased 482 million primarily due to an increase in wellhead sales price and an increase in sales volumes partially offset by increased production operating expenses gathering operating income increased 180 million due to an increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by decreased gathered volumes and increased gathering operating expenses 

  

total operating revenues were 4892 million for 2005 compared to 3904 million for 2004 the 988 million increase in net operating revenues was primarily due to a 16 increase in the average wellhead sales price a 9 increase in production total sales volumes and a 33 increase in gathering revenues the 071 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price was mainly attributable to increased market prices on unhedged volumes partially offset by an adjustment of 106 million the adjustment was principally due to the company’s conclusion that the wellhead sales price allocated to a third party’s working interest gas in previous periods may have been lower than the company was obligated to pay the 9 increase in production total sales volumes was 

  

  

primarily the result of the purchase of esp partially offset by the sale of certain noncore gas properties the 33 increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to a 41 increase in the average gathering fee partially offset by a 5 decline in gathered volumes the increase in average gathering fee is reflective of the company’s commitment to an increased infrastructure capital program along with higher gas prices and related operating cost increases the decrease in gathered volumes in 2005 was primarily due to the sale of certain noncore gathering assets and thirdparty customer volume shutins caused by maintenance projects on interstate pipelines these factors were partially offset by increased gathered volumes for company production in 2005 these increases in production and gathering revenues were partially offset by the recognition of a gain of 27 million in 2004 that resulted from the renegotiation of a processing agreement 

  

operating expenses totaled 1956 million for 2005 compared to 1631 million for 2004 a significant reason for this 325 million increase was due to additional costs of 150 million resulting from the purchase of esp the 150 million of costs were primarily related to dda 47 million production taxes 46 million lease operating expenses 37 million and gathering expenses 20 million excluding the esp costs the 175 million increase in operating expenses was due to increases of 91 million in production taxes 44 million in dda 21 million in sga 08 million in loe 06 million in gathering expenses and 05 million in impairment charges the increase in production taxes was due to increased property taxes 54 million and severance taxes 37 million the increase in property taxes was a direct result of increased prices and sales volumes in prior years as property taxes in several of the taxing jurisdictions where the company’s wells are located are calculated based on historical gas commodity prices and sales volumes the increase in severance taxes a production tax directly imposed on the value of gas extracted was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes in the various taxing jurisdictions that impose such taxes 

  

the increase in dda excluding esp was due to a 005 per mcf increase in the unit depletion rate 43 million and increased depreciation on a higher asset base 14 million partially offset by lower depletion as a result of decreased volumes from the sale of certain noncore gas properties 13 million the increase in the unit depletion rate was primarily due to the net development capital additions in 2005 and 2004 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base the increase in sga was the result of increased legal and professional fees and bad debt expenses the increase in loe was the result of the company’s strategy to focus on current infrastructure as well as increased costs from vendors due to higher gas prices the increase in gathering expenses was primarily attributable to increased electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors field labor and related employment costs and compressor station operation and repair costs the gathering and compression increases are consistent with the company’s strategic decision to focus on improving gathering and compression and metering effectiveness such increases were partially offset by reductions in gathering expenses due to reduced gathered volumes the impairment charges in 2005 were related to the company’s relocation of its corporate headquarters and other operations to its new consolidated office space 

  

other income net for 2004 was the result of a 61 million settlement received from a previously disputed insurance coverage claim offset by a 55 million expense related to the company’s settlement of a prepaid forward contract in 2004 

  

fiscal year ended december 31 2004 vs december 31 2003 

  

equitable supply’s operating income totaled 2274 million for 2004 compared to 1958 million for 2003 total operating revenues were 3904 million for 2004 compared to 3324 million for 2003 the 580 million increase in total operating revenues was primarily due to a 14 increase in the average wellhead sales price a 5 increase in production total sales volumes and a 7 increase in gathering revenues the 055 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price was attributable to higher gas commodity prices increased volumes at higher hedged prices and increased basis over the same period in 2003 the 5 increase in production total sales volumes was primarily the result of new wells drilled and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells the increase in gathering revenues was attributable to a 6 increase in the average gathering fee and higher equitable production sales volumes resulting in increased gathered volumes partially offset by third party customer volume shutins 

  

operating expenses were 1631 million for 2004 compared to 1366 million for 2003 this 265 million increase was due to increases of 104 million in gathering and compression expenses 71 million in dda 48 

  

  

million in production taxes 28 million in loe and 14 million in sga the increase in gathering and compression expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compressor station operation and repair costs field labor and related employment costs field line maintenance costs and compressor electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors the additional compression costs resulted from a 24 increase in horse power to approximately 112000 horse power in 2004 from approximately 90000 horse power in 2003 the increase in field labor was due to an increase in headcount related to equitable gathering’s strategy to spend more time and resources to aggressively tend to the improvement of the base infrastructure actions taken by equitable gathering to support this strategy such as the installation of compressor stations and facilities to reduce surface pressure and efforts related to reducing the internal curtailment of gas sales increased compression and field line maintenance costs in 2004 

  

the increase in dda was primarily due to a 005 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate increased production volumes and capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions the 005 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate was due to the net development capital additions in 2003 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base the increase in production taxes was primarily due to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes the increase in loe was primarily due to a charge to earnings for environmental site assessments performed in accordance with the company’s amended spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc compliance plan and increased liability insurance premiums the increase in sga was due to increased franchise taxes in 2004 

  

see “capital resources and liquidity” section for discussion of equitable supply’s capital expenditures during 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

outlook 

  

equitable supply’s business strategy is focused on achieving profit maximization by primarily focusing on developing new opportunities through increased drilling and other development in the appalachian basin as well as improvements to and expansion of its gathering systems and secondarily focusing on cost control the company believes that the margin leverage from realizable gas prices outweighs the increase in unit cost structure necessary to implement this strategy key elements of equitable supply’s strategy include 

  

•   expanding production through the drilling program equitable supply has a multiyear drilling program which will enable the company to continue the growth of its production business equitable supply intends to increase its drilling rate by over 20 to 550 wells in 2006 the company’s forecasted capital expenditures for 2006 include a 48 increase in expenditures related to appalachian development the company believes that it has available on acreage it controls at least 4600 net drilling locations on unproved properties in addition to 2292 net proved undeveloped drilling locations equitable supply believes that its 692 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within a reasonable time period currently estimated to be five years because 1 equitable supply has completed substantially all of the wells it has drilled in the last three years 2 equitable supply developed proved undeveloped reserves of 70 bcfe and 62 bcfe during 2005 and 2004 respectively and 3 equitable supply’s plans include developing similar levels of proved undeveloped reserves going forward 

  

•   maintaining and enhancing base well production equitable supply will seek to maximize production of existing base wells by increased focus on maintenance technology improvements and recompletions deepening a well to another horizon or attempting to secure production from a shallower horizon through these activities equitable supply can benefit from higher gas prices by obtaining accelerated volumes from its existing wells 

  

•   expanding the gathering system to support drilling and third party gathering revenues the company will continue to expand its pipeline and compression infrastructure in order to manage increased gathered volumes from both company drilling programs and third party shippers the company plans to expand its gathering systems by approximately 190 miles of pipeline and approximately 20000 horsepower of compression in 2006 many of the existing pipelines will be increased in size to handle these additional volumes and new pipelines will be constructed to expanded drilling areas the company plans to build new compression stations as well as expand existing stations in order to transport these volumes to sales points on major interstate pipelines 

  

  

•   investing in midstream gathering and processing in the appalachian basin in a high price natural gas market infrastructure needed to support increased drilling and to move gas from wellhead to market presents an acute need but also a significant opportunity for the company the company has begun a significant new pipeline infrastructure project the big sandy pipeline the 60 mile 20inch pipeline is expected to have a capacity of 70000 dekatherms per day and will connect the kentucky hydrocarbon processing plant in langley kentucky with the tennessee gas pipeline interconnect in carter county kentucky the big sandy pipeline is projected to cost a total of 83 million the company is also planning an upgrade to its langley plant these projects are scheduled for operation in 2007 and will enable the company to further support its drilling growth mitigate pipeline curtailments increase flexibility and reliability of its midstream gathering systems and capitalize on third party producer demand in the appalachian basin natural gas processing expansion will continue to be required in order to meet the interstate pipeline gas quality standards and will represent an opportunity for the company the company is looking at several processing pipeline and compression expansion opportunities in appalachia and expects to invest in additional projects in 2006 and beyond 

  

•   optimizing throughput of the existing gathering system the company will optimize its existing gathering assets by making technological improvements upgrading existing compressors and eliminating bottlenecks in its gathering systems while these initiatives will result in increased costs the company will continue to focus on ensuring that costs incurred in its gathering activities both operating and capital plus a reasonable rate of return on its gathering assets are recovered in rates for transporting gas on its gathering systems a part of this strategy includes increasing the rates that the company charges to parties who transport gas on these systems in certain instances such rate increases require regulatory action the company expects the process of increasing gathering rates to extend beyond 2006 

  

other income statement items

•   an increase in margin deposit requirements on the company’s natural gas hedge agreements to 3178 million as of december 31 2005 from 369 million as of december 31 2004 as further detailed under the captions “financing activities” and “shortterm borrowings” to follow the company has taken steps to ensure it has adequate liquidity for working capital and margin requirement needs 

  

•   an increase in tax payments to 2515 million in 2005 compared to 230 million in 2004 primarily due to the sale of the company’s kerrmcgee shares the sale of the noresco discontinued operations and the sale of noncore gas properties for significant taxable gains in 2005 

  

•   an increase in inventory to 2899 million as of december 31 2005 from 2046 million as of december 31 2004 primarily due to increased natural gas prices on volumes stored in 2005 compared to 2004 

  

  

•   cash contributions of approximately 204 million to its pension plan during 2005 as compared to no contributions in 2004 

  

partially offset by 

  

•   an increase in accounts payable to 2426 million as of december 31 2005 from 1712 million as of december 31 2004 largely due to increased operating costs resulting from increased drilling activity and higher natural gas prices 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 1800 million for 2004 as compared to 1286 million for 2003 a 514 million increase between years the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to the following 

  

•   increased collections from customers in 2004 as compared to 2003 driven primarily by increased net operating revenues in the company’s supply segment 

  

•   no cash contributions to the company’s pension plan in 2004 as compared to a cash contribution of 518 million in 2003 

  

partially offset by 

  

•   a 368 million payment in 2004 resulting from the company’s amendment of a prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004 this amendment resulted in the company repaying the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract 

  

•   cash flows from operations were also affected by other working capital changes during 2004 

  

investing activities 

  

cash flows provided by investing activities totaled 3477 million for 2005 as compared to 1585 million of cash flows used in investing activities for 2004 a net increase of 5062 million in cash flows provided by investing activities between years the increase in cash flows provided by investing activities was attributable to the following 

  

•   proceeds of 4605 million from the sale of the company’s remaining 70 million shares of kerrmcgee in 2005 as compared to proceeds of 429 million from the sale of 08 million shares of kerrmcgee in 2004

partially offset by 

  

•   an increase in capital expenditures to 333 million in 2005 from 202 million in 2004 see discussion of capital expenditures below 

  

cash flows used in investing activities totaled 1585 million for 2004 as compared to 2153 million for 2003 a net decrease of 568 in cash flows used in investing activities between years the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures see discussion of capital expenditures below to 202 million in 2004 from 265 million in 2003 

  

  

capital expenditures 

  

   

 the 2006 capital expenditures include 2005 capital commitments totaling 105 million 

  

capital expenditures for appalachian holdings development and gathering system improvements and extensions increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to an increased drilling and development plan in 2005 such expenditures were lower in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in the level of development drilling in the appalachian holdings to allow equitable supply to concentrate on its core assets and ensure a proper level of return on all new projects 

  

capital expenditures for equitable utilities increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to the installation of electronic meter reading technology on approximately 113000 of the 265000 meters in the distribution operations the 17 million project to install electronic meter reading technology on all 265000 meters is expected to be completed in 2006 the company anticipates that the benefits from this project will result in approximately 20 million in annual cost savings capital expenditures for equitable utilities decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a decrease in technological enhancement project spending partially offset by increased main line replacement costs and new business development spending 

  

the company’s capital expenditures forecasted for 2006 represent a significant increase over capital expenditures in 2005 the 194 million targeted for the development of appalachian holdings in 2006 represents a 63 million increase over 2005 which is attributable to an expanded drilling program in virginia west virginia and kentucky the 222 million forecasted for 2006 gathering system improvements and extensions includes a further expansion in infrastructure to support the company’s current and future drilling plans and expenditures for the big sandy pipeline project the pipeline which is projected to cost a total of 83 million including 53 million in the 2006 forecast is scheduled for operation in 2007 

  

the 78 million forecasted for equitable utilities includes 73 million for infrastructure improvements and 5 million for new business development the infrastructure improvements include improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines the continued installation of automated metering devices in the distribution business and storage enhancements the new business capital is planned for extensions of existing infrastructure into adjacent geographic areas 

  

the company expects to finance its capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and with shortterm debt see discussion in the “shortterm borrowings” section below regarding the financing capacity of the company 

  

  

financing activities 

  

cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 392 million for 2005 as compared to 558 million of cash flows used in financing activities for 2004 a net increase of 950 in cash flows provided by financing activities between years the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2004 to 2005 was attributable largely to the following 

  

•   proceeds from the issuance in 2005 of 150 million of notes with a stated interest rate of 5 and a maturity date of october 1 2015 

  

•   a decrease in current maturities of the company’s mediumterm notes of 105 million in 2005 

  

partially offset by 

  

•   less of an increase in amounts borrowed under shortterm loans in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  

•   an increase in dividends paid to shareholders to 997 million in 2005 from 894 million in 2004

cash flows used in financing activities totaled 558 million for 2004 as compared to 1129 million of cash flows provided by financing activities for 2003 a net increase of 1687 million in cash flows used in financing activities between years the increase in cash flows used by financing activities from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to the following 

  

•   a net increase of 750 million in longterm debt during 2003 due to the issuance of 200 million of notes offset by the redemption of 125 million of trust preferred securities with no such items in 2004 

  

•   an increase in the cost to repurchase shares of the company’s outstanding common stock to 1185 million for 47 million shares in 2004 from 552 million for 29 million shares in 2003 

  

•   an increase in dividends paid to shareholders to 894 million in 2004 from 604 million in 2003 

  

the company believes that cash generated from operations amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position are more than adequate to meet the company’s reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices the company’s 1 billion fiveyear revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital capital expenditures share repurchases and other lawful purposes including support of the company’s commercial paper program historically shortterm borrowings under the commercial paper program have been used mainly to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season due to continued higher than average natural gas prices and resulting increases in the company’s net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements the company also borrowed increased amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its interestbearing margin deposits under its exchangetraded natural gas agreements the amount of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2005 was 3653 million interest rates on these shortterm loans averaged 35 during 2005 

  

  

security ratings and financing triggers 

  

the table below reflects the current credit ratings for the outstanding debt instruments of the company changes in credit ratings may affect the company’s cost of shortterm and longterm debt and its access to the credit markets 

  

   

the company’s credit ratings on its noncreditenhanced senior unsecured longterm debt determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit the lower the company’s credit rating the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate as of december 31 2005 the company had no outstanding borrowings against these lines of credit the company pays facility fees to maintain credit availability 

  

the company’s credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant if the credit rating agencies downgrade the company’s ratings particularly below investment grade it may significantly limit the company’s access to the commercial paper market and borrowing costs would increase in addition the company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings incur increased margin deposit requirements and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would decrease 

  

the company’s debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that if not complied with could require early payment additional collateral support or similar actions the most important default events include maintaining covenants with respect to maximum leverage ratio insolvency events nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions the company’s current credit facility’s financial covenants require a total debttototal capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 this calculation excludes unrealized gains or losses from hedging transactions recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december 31 2005 the company is in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants 

  

commodity risk management 

  

the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company’s risk management program includes the use of exchangetraded natural gas futures contracts and options and otc natural gas swap agreements and options collectively derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in natural gas prices and for trading purposes the preponderance of derivative commodity instruments currently utilized by the company are fixed price swaps or nymextraded forwards 

  

during the third quarter of 2005 the company increased its hedge position for 2006 through 2012 the new hedges are collars which protect revenues from decreases in natural gas prices below a floor but also limit the upside exposure to increases in prices to a cap 

  

  

the approximate volumes and prices of the company’s hedges for 2006 through 2008 are 

  

   

 the above price is based on a conversion rate of 105 mmbtumcf 

  

the company’s current hedged position provides price protection for a substantial portion of expected equity production for the years 2006 through 2008 and a significant portion of expected equity production for the years 2009 through 2012 the company’s exposure to a 010 change in average nymex natural gas price is less than 001 per diluted share for 2006 and ranges from 001 to 002 per diluted share per year for 2007 and 2008 the company also engages in a limited number of basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices see note 3 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

investment securities   

the company’s availableforsale investments as of december 31 2005 consist of approximately 252 million of equity securities that are intended to fund certain liabilities for which the company is selfinsured these investments are recorded at fair market value during 2005 the company sold all of its remaining 70 million shares of kerrmcgee in various transactions for total net pretax proceeds of 4605 million and a total pretax gain of 1103 million net of 958 million in costs associated with the termination of the three related variable share forward transactions entered into in june 2004 subsequent to the westportkerrmcgee merger the sale of these shares was determined by the company to constitute the best use of this asset due to the significant appreciation in the value of the kerrmcgee shares during 2005

incentive compensation 

  

the company has now fully transitioned to a longterm incentive approach that is focused on performancerestricted stock or units and timerestricted stock management and the board of directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach more closely aligns management’s incentives with shareholder rewards than is the case with traditional stock options the company has long utilized timerestricted stock in its compensation plans and began issuing performancerestricted units in 2002 no new stock options have been awarded since 2003 

  

  

the company recorded the following incentive compensation expense in continuing operations for the periods indicated below 

  

   

the longterm incentive compensation expenses are primarily associated with executive performance incentive programs “the programs” the longterm incentive compensation expenses during 2005 were higher than during 2004 primarily due to a higher estimated share price for the programs being expensed as a result of the company’s share price appreciation and a greater number of units granted under the current programs as compared to the programs in place during 2004 the longterm incentive compensation expenses during 2004 were higher than during 2003 primarily as a result of the company’s share price appreciation as well 

  

the company currently estimates 2006 total incentive compensation expense of approximately 35 million less than that incurred during 2005 due primarily to the payout of one of the programs in december 2005

allowance for doubtful accounts   equitable gas encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable as such equitable gas records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision equitable gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable “writeoffs” as a percentage of total revenue this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis and is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather both of these items ultimately impact the customers’ ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the passthrough of purchased gas costs to the customers management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time 

  

for 2005 the monthly provision for uncollectible accounts was established at approximately 2 of residential sales a decrease from the 4 rate utilized for 2004 beginning in april 2004 the company began collecting a regulatory surcharge in the amount of 030 per mcfe of gas sold to residential customers to help recover the costs associated with providing gas service to lowincome customers this surcharge is credited to the reserve for uncollectible accounts and reduces the amount which would otherwise be recognized as bad debt expense this surcharge totaled 65 million in 2005 and 33 million in 2004 in addition during 2004 equitable gas implemented a new customer information and billing system that has enabled the company to better segment customer information in order to identify customers who may have difficulty paying also under the responsible utility customer protection act which became effective in pennsylvania in december 2004 equitable gas is permitted to send winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250 of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the pa puc the company took advantage of these winter terminations during 2005 in an effort to reduce its uncollectible accounts receivable despite the continued increases in natural gas prices throughout 2005 the company expects to realize a decrease in accounts written off as a result of these initiatives and has consequently reduced its provision for doubtful accounts 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts are “critical accounting estimates” because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the changes in the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital the actual weather commodity prices and other internal and external economic conditions such as the mix of the customer base between residential commercial and industrial may vary significantly from management’s assumptions and may impact the ultimate collectibility of customer accounts additionally the regulatory environment allows certain customers to enter into longterm payment arrangements the ultimate collectibility of which is difficult to determine 

  

executive performance incentive programs the company treats its executive performance incentive programs as variable plans the awards under the 2003 executive performance incentive program vested in december 2005 the actual cost to be recorded for the 2005 executive performance incentive program 2005 program will not be known until the measurement date which is in december 2008 requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized the number of units to be paid out under the 2005 program is dependent upon a combination of a level of total shareholder return relative to the performance of a peer group and the company’s average absolute return on capital during the fouryear performance period the company reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual for the 2005 program when changes in these assumptions result in a material change in the value of the ultimate payout in the current period the company

  

  

estimated that the performance measures would be met at 175 of the full value of the units for the 2005 program and that the estimated end of 2008 share price would be 4500 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the 2005 program is a “critical accounting estimate” because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the company’s shares and the performance of the peer group additionally the impact on net income of these changes could be material management’s assumptions about future stock price and company performance relative to the peer group requires significant judgment each company’s inherent volatility combined with the volatility in commodity prices impact the ultimate amount of the payout and make it difficult to provide sensitivity metrics to demonstrate what impact a change in the company’s stock price will have on the estimate however assuming no change in the attainment of performance measures a 10 increase in the company’s stock price assumptions for december 31 2008 would result in an increase in 2006 compensation expense under the 2005 program of approximately 4 million a 10 decrease in the company’s stock price assumptions would result in a decrease in 2006 compensation expense of the same amount 

  

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 109 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse please read note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from marktomarket hedging losses recorded in other comprehensive loss deferred revenues and expenses and state net operating loss carryforwards the company has established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized the company also recorded a 153 million charge in 2005 related to compensation deferred and accrued under certain executive compensation plans as it was determined that this compensation will not be deductible under section 162m of the irc no other valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets any change in the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a “critical accounting estimate” because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed evidence used includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

derivative commodity instruments 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas which can affect the operating results of the company primarily through the equitable supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the equitable utilities segment the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption “commodity risk management” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item 7 of this form 10k the company uses simple nonleveraged derivative commodity instruments that are placed 

  

  

with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit its exposure to shifts in market prices the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

for the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge the company’s forecasted production the company sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk the financial instruments currently utilized by the company include futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity the company also considers options and other contractual agreements in determining its commodity hedging strategy management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted in general the company’s strategy is to hedge production at prices considered to be favorable to the company the company attempts to take advantage of price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when market prices move above historical averages and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below these levels the goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility to the extent that the company has hedged its production at prices below the current market price the company is unable to benefit fully from increases in the price of natural gas 

  

for derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes the marketing group engages in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits the financial instruments currently utilized by the company for trading purposes include forward contracts and swap agreements 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2005 the company had hedged portions of expected equity production through 2012 by utilizing futures contracts swap agreements and collar agreements covering approximately 3110 bcf of natural gas see the “commodity risk management” and “capital resources and liquidity” sections of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form 10k for further discussion a decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2005 levels would increase the fair value of natural gas instruments by approximately 2683 million an increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas would decrease the fair value by approximately 2821 million 

  

with respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for trading purposes as of december 31 2005 an increase or decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2005 levels would not have a significant impact on the fair value 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments using a method similar to its normal change in fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2005 the price change was then applied to the derivative commodity instruments recorded on the company’s balance sheet resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the derivative commodity instruments held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of a portion of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the derivative commodity instrument portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the derivative commodity instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and the anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

  

if the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

other market risks 

  

the company has variable rate shortterm debt as such there is some exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the company under its current capital structure the company maintains fixed rate longterm debt that is not subject to risk exposure from fluctuating interest rates 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value nymextraded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties the company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the company’s criteria for credit and liquidity strength

equitable utilities 

  

equitable utilities contains both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated group consists of the distribution and interstate pipeline operations while the nonregulated group is involved in the nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas risk management activities for equitable utilities and equitable supply and the sale of energyrelated products and services equitable utilities generated approximately 36 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2004 

  

natural gas distribution 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution operations are carried out by equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory for equitable gas includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as “farm tap” service as the customer is served directly from a well or gathering pipeline in eastern kentucky and in west virginia the distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 276300 customers comprising 257400 residential customers and 18900 commercial and industrial customers equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania 

  

equitable gas’ natural gas supply portfolio includes shortterm purchases purchases to be delivered in one month or less mediumterm purchases purchases to be delivered in less than one year but more than one month and longterm purchases purchases to be delivered in more than one year these natural gas supply contracts are obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the gulf coast purchases from local producers in the appalachian area and purchases from gas marketers including an affiliate of equitable gas equitable gas’ supply purchases include various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different indexrelated prices these supply purchase contracts qualify as “normal purchases and normal sales” of natural gas 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 70 of calendar year 2004 revenues occurring during the winter heating season january–march november–december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during offpeak season to accommodate higher customer demand during the winter heating season 

  

  

interstate pipeline 

  

the interstate pipeline operations of equitable utilities include the natural gas transmission storage and gathering activities of equitrans lp equitrans and carnegie interstate pipeline company carnegie pipeline effective january 1 2004 equitrans and carnegie pipeline merged with equitrans surviving the merger the interstate pipeline operations offer gas transportation storage gathering and related services to affiliates and third parties in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc public service electric and gas company keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy company and amerada hess corporation in 2004 approximately 68 of transportation volumes and approximately 77 of revenues were from affiliates 

  

the present regulatory environment is designed to increase competition in the natural gas industry this environment has created a number of opportunities for pipeline companies to expand services and serve new markets the company has taken advantage of selected market opportunities by concentrating on equitrans’ underground storage facilities and interconnections with five major interstate pipelines – texas eastern transmission columbia gas transmission national fuel gas supply tennessee gas pipeline and dominion transmission the geographic locations of equitrans’ storage facilities coupled with the flexibility provided by these interconnecting pipelines provides opportunities for equitrans to access natural gas markets in the northeastern united states 

  

energy marketing 

  

equitable utilities’ unregulated marketing operations include the nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas at equitable gas marketing and risk management activities at equitable energy llc equitable energy and the sale of energyrelated products and services by equitable homeworks equitable energy purchases stores and sells natural gas at both the retail and wholesale level primarily in the appalachian and midatlantic regions services and products offered by the marketing operations include commodity procurement and delivery physical natural gas management operations and control and customer support services to the company’s natural gas customers in 2001 equitable gas received approval from the pennsylvania public utility commission pa puc to implement a performancebased incentive that provides to customers a purchased gas cost credit which is fixed in amount while enabling equitable gas to retain all revenues in excess of the credit obtained through more effective management of upstream interstate pipeline capacity this performancebased incentive provides an opportunity for equitable gas to make shortterm releases of unutilized pipeline capacity for a fee and to participate in the bundling of gas supply and pipeline capacity for “offsystem” sales an “offsystem” sale involves the purchase and delivery of gas to a customer at mutually agreedupon points on facilities not owned by the company these revenues are recorded with equitable utilities’ nonjurisdictional operations 

  

the company also engages in trading and risk management activities with the objective of limiting the company’s exposure to shifts in market prices and optimizing the use of the company’s assets described above equitable energy uses asset management to hedge projected production to optimize storage capacity assets through trading activities and to perform risk management services for large industrial customers 

  

rates and regulation 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution rates terms of service contracts with affiliates and issuance of securities are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc the distribution rates terms of service and contracts with affiliates are also subject to comprehensive regulation by the public service commission of west virginia and the distribution rates are subject to regulation by the kentucky public service commission pipeline safety is generally regulated by the rules of the us department of transportation andor by the state regulatory commissions the us occupational safety and health administration as well as its state level counterparts also imposes certain additional safety regulations on the operations of equitable utilities 

  

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas the interstate transportation and the sale for resale of natural gas including transportation rates storage tariffs and various other matters are subject to federal regulation primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation the ferc’s regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation 

  

  

of natural gas some of the trading activities of the energy marketing operations are subject to regulation by among others the commodity futures trading commission cftc the ferc and the pa puc 

  

for additional discussion of regulatory matters involving equitable utilities see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and note 11 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

competitive environment 

  

equitable gas operates in areas with varying service area rules including state utility commission exclusively certificated service areas and nonexclusive service territories in competitive areas additionally competitive local distribution companies exist within equitable gas’ service area western pennsylvania is one of the few regions in the united states where multiple local distribution companies compete for both new and existing customers 

  

equitrans will be experiencing significant competitive challenges over the next few years as 95 of the pipeline’s firm contracts expire in calendar year 2006 and the remaining 5 expire in 2007 equitrans’ ability to respond to these competitive challenges will be influenced in part by the ultimate resolution of its recently filed rate case 

  

the large industrial market is extremely competitive resulting in very low realized margins however fluctuations in industrial demand do not have a significant impact on the company’s financial results 

  

equitable supply 

  

equitable’s production business develops produces and sells natural gas and to a limited extent crude oil and its associated byproducts with operations in the appalachian region of the united states its natural gas gathering activity consists of gathering the company’s and third party gas and some processing and sales of natural gas liquids equitable supply generated approximately 58 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2004 

  

production 

  

equitable’s production business operating through equitable production company and several smaller affiliates referred to collectively as equitable production is among the largest owners of proved natural gas reserves in the appalachian basin equitable production currently operates approximately 12600 producing wells in the appalachian basin as of december 31 2004 the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 2109 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe including proved undeveloped reserves of 477 bcfe 

  

the company’s reserves are located entirely in the appalachian basin the appalachian basin is characterized by wells with comparatively low rates of annual decline in production wells generally produce for periods longer than 50 years low production costs per well and high british thermal unit btu or energy content for operational and commercial reasons some of the gas produced is processed to allow heavier hydrocarbon propane butane and ethane streams to be stripped and sold separately within certain limits the company can vary the amount of the hydrocarbons extracted this can cause the conversion rate between energy content measured in btu to volumes measured in million cubic feet equivalent mmcfe to vary once drilled and completed wells in the appalachian basin typically have low ongoing operating and maintenance requirements rates of production are low in comparison to other geographic locations in the united states many of the company’s wells have been producing for decades and in some cases since the early 1900’s reserve estimates for properties with long production histories are generally more reliable than estimates for properties with shorter production histories 

  

management believes that virtually all of the company’s wells are low risk development wells in part because they are drilled to relatively shallow depths ranging from 1000 to 7000 feet below the surface many of these wells are completed in more than one producing formation including coal formations in certain areas and production from these formations may be commingled 

  

in the appalachian basin during 2004 equitable production drilled 314 gross wells 246 net wells at a success rate of 100 drilling was concentrated within equitable’s core areas of southwest virginia southeast kentucky and southern west virginia this activity resulted in 147 million cubic feet mmcf per day of gas sales 

  

  

and proved developed reserve additions of 79 bcfe the 79 bcfe of proved developed reserve additions include approximately 17 billion cubic feet bcf of proved developed extensions discoveries and other additions that were not previously classified as undeveloped the remaining 62 bcfe of proved developed reserve additions relate to proved undeveloped reserves that were transferred to proved developed reserves 

  

equitable production currently has an inventory of 35 million gross acres of which approximately 72 is considered undeveloped as of december 31 2004 the company estimated the proved undeveloped reserves of the underlying leases and fee interests to be 477 bcfe from approximately 1616 gross proved undeveloped drilling locations 1441 net proved undeveloped drilling locations in the last three years equitable production has completed substantially all of the wells it has drilled additionally given the fact that the company has developed proved undeveloped reserves of 62 bcfe and 88 bcfe during 2004 and 2003 respectively and that the company’s plans include developing similar levels of proved undeveloped reserves going forward the company believes that the 477 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves will be developed in a reasonable period of time currently estimated to be four years 

  

gathering 

  

at december 31 2004 equitable gathering was comprised of kentucky west virginia gas company llc equitable field services llc equitable gathering llc and the gathering operations of equitable production company referred to collectively as equitable gathering 

  

equitable gathering derives its revenues from charges it assesses to customers on a gathering and production pipeline system in the appalachian basin the system includes approximately 9000 miles of pipeline located throughout west virginia eastern kentucky southwestern virginia eastern ohio and portions of pennsylvania over 80 of the volumes through the pipeline system interconnect with three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the gathering system also maintains interconnects with equitrans the company’s interstate transmission affiliate that affords access to natural gas markets in southwestern pennsylvania and the northeastern united states maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to multiple markets and the flexibility to redirect deliveries when flow interruptions occur 

  

gathered sales volumes for 2004 totaled 1273 bcf of which approximately 49 related to affiliate sales volumes primarily the gathering of equitable production’s equity sales volumes 35 related to third party volumes and the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company still operates for a fee approximately 69 of the company’s 2004 gathering revenues were from affiliates due to increased operating and capital costs equitable gathering is currently charging below cost to its gathering customers equitable gathering will pursue recovery of the increased cost of providing services through the rates it charges to its customers 

  

effective january 1 2005 the company reorganized its gathering business subject to receipt of applicable approvals this reorganization is consistent with the company’s initiative to separate its production and gathering businesses in order to ensure that all gathering costs are appropriately captured and gathering rates charged to customers include a proper return certain gathering systems are subject to regulation 

  

competitive environment 

  

equitable supply’s commercial operations are focused on selling natural gas at a high level of reliability of delivery equitable supply does not actively engage in any activities to differentiate its products and therefore receives marketbased pricing because the appalachian basin is geographically located in the northeastern united states gas prices are generally higher than those prices for gas located in the gulf region of the country given the differences in supply and demand of natural gas in those areas and the relative cost to transport to customers in the northeast as a consequence equitable supply’s location provides a price advantage over those companies located in the gulf region of the country 

  

the company has noticed some relative value erosion of midatlantic basis as a result of new base load gas supplies basis is the difference between the nymex futures contracts at henry hub and the cash price at other 

  

  

market points if the rate of supply growth in appalachia exceeds the midatlantic region’s growth in demand there may be further weakening in basis especially in the summer months at this time this erosion has not had a significant impact on the company’s results 

  

the combination of its longlived production low drilling costs high drilling completion rates at shallow depths and proximity to natural gas markets has had a substantial impact on the development of the appalachian basin resulting in a highly fragmented operating environment in 2004 kentucky virginia and west virginia had approximately 3500 independent operators and approximately 94000 producing natural gas and oil wells also the previous availability of nonconventional fuels tax credit incentives has resulted in extensive drilling in the shallow formations with these low technical risk characteristics

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

equitable’s consolidated income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2004 was 2799 million or 444 per diluted share compared with 1736 million or 274 per diluted share for 2003 and 1506 million or 236 per diluted share for 2002 

  

the 2004 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased 61 from 2003 primarily due to the gain recorded as a result of the westport resources corporation westportkerrmcgee corporation kerrmcgee merger as described below higher realized selling prices an increase in sales volumes from production proceeds received from an insurance settlement and the gain recorded on the sale of 800000 kerrmcgee shares in 2004 also helped to improve 2004 earnings the improved 2004 earnings were partially offset by additional impairment charges recorded in 2004 related to the company’s international investments an increase in the cost of the company’s executive performance incentive programs the gain recorded on the sale of westport shares in 2003 the costs to settle the cash balance portion of a defined benefit pension plan in 2004 an increase over the prior year in charitable foundation contribution expense the loss on a 2004 amendment of the company’s prepaid forward contract warmer weather in 2004 and an increase in interest expense 

  

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2004 was 338 compared to 320 reported for the same period a year ago the increase in the company’s effective tax rate is primarily the result of the onetime permanent tax benefit realized from the 2003 gift of qualified appreciated stock to equitable resources foundation inc which was created by the company to support development programs in communities where the company conducts business the 2004 gift of qualified appreciated stock did not generate a significant permanent booktax difference as the investment was accounted for as availableforsale in 2004 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the 2003 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased 15 from 2002 due to an increase in average natural gas prices gains on the sale of westport stock increased equity earnings in westport prior to the company’s change in accounting treatment for its investment in westport an increase in sales volumes from production less minority interest expense recognized in 2003 associated with the company’s ownership in appalachian basin partners lp abp and an impairment of the company’s jamaica power plant recognized in 2002 the improved 2003 earnings were partially offset by an impairment of an equity investment in an independent power plant project located in panama costs associated with the 2003 executive performance incentive program higher depreciation depletion and amortization expense resulting from an increase in production volumes and the unit depletion rate an increase in production and leasehold expenses primarily the result of an increase in severance taxes attributable to higher average natural gas prices and an increase in maintenance and other repairs an increase in interest expense primarily due to a net increase in the amount of outstanding debt an increase in benefit and insurance costs and the establishment of equitable resources foundation inc 

  

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2003 was 320 compared to 340 reported for the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease in the company’s effective tax rate was primarily the result of the permanent tax benefit from the 2003 gift of qualified appreciated stock see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments excluding westport minority interest and other income net interest expense and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarters’ costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters’ expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive costs pension costs and administrative costs totaling 458 million 204 million and 54 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively were not allocated to business 

  

  

segments the increase in 2004 is primarily related to the costs for the executive performance incentive program more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements as well as the costs to settle the cash balance portion of a defined benefit plan more fully described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

the company has reconciled the segments’ operating income equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments excluding westport minority interest and other income net to the company’s consolidated operating income equity earnings from nonconsolidated investment excluding westport minority interest and other income net totals in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements additionally these subtotals are reconciled to the company’s consolidated net income in note 2 the company has also reported the components of each segment’s operating income and various operational measures in the sections below and where appropriate has provided information describing how a measure was derived equitable’s management believes that presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition operations and trends of each of equitable’s segments without being obscured by the financial condition operations and trends for the other segments or by the effects of corporate allocations of interest and income taxes in addition management uses these measures for budget planning purposes 

  

equitable utilities 

  

equitable utilities’ operations comprise the gathering sale and transportation of natural gas to customers at stateregulated rates interstate pipeline gathering transportation and storage of natural gas subject to federal regulation the unregulated marketing of natural gas and limited trading activities 

  

natural gas distribution 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution operations are carried out by equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory for equitable gas includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as “farm tap” service as the customer is served directly from a well or gathering pipeline in eastern kentucky and in west virginia the distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 276300 customers comprising 257400 residential customers and 18900 commercial and industrial customers equitable gas is subject to rate regulation by state regulatory commissions in pennsylvania west virginia and kentucky equitable gas also operates a small gathering system in pennsylvania which is not subject to comprehensive regulation 

  

a pennsylvania public utility commission pa puc mandated asset service life study was filed with the pa puc by equitable gas in may 2004 this study resulted in an increase in the estimated useful life for equitable gas’ distribution main lines and service lines as a result of installing plastic pipe the pa puc statutory review period expired in october 2004 with no objection from the pa puc to modify equitable gas’ asset service life study as a consequence the useful life of the distribution main lines and service lines was extended in the fourth quarter on a retroactive basis to january 1 2004 resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately 35 million in 2004 equitable gas recorded this depreciation expense adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2004 this adjustment did not have a significant impact upon previously reported information 

  

pennsylvania law requires that local distribution companies develop and implement programs to assist lowincome customers with paying their gas bills the costs of these programs are recovered through rates charged to other residential customers equitable gas has several such programs in august 2003 equitable gas submitted revisions to those programs for pa puc approval the revisions were designed to make participation in the lowincome programs more accessible thereby improving participants’ ability to pay their bills in october 2003 the pa puc approved equitable gas’ revised programs and instructed the various stakeholders to ascertain whether additional funding was necessary to implement the revised programs ultimately consensus was reached to allow the company to collect an additional 30 per mcf to fund the programs based on recent billing volumes this would equate to approximately 70 million in additional annual revenue by pa puc order of april 1 2004 the funding mechanism was approved for all residential consumption beginning april 2 2004 and is expected to remain in place until equitable gas seeks authority to change the funding mechanism this funding mechanism has not had a significant impact on 2004 results because it was approved at the end of the highest volume quarter and during the remainder of 2004 the company increased spending and focused its collection efforts internally on improving 

  

  

analytical resources to enable the company to reduce outstanding customer balances in 2005 and thereafter it is expected that this mechanism will become a key component in the company’s efforts to reduce bad debt expense 

  

on november 30 2004 pennsylvania governor edward g rendell signed into law the responsible utility customer protection act act 201 act 201 which became effective on december 14 2004 established new procedures for utilities regarding collection activities with respect to deposits payment plans and terminations for residential customers and is intended to help utility companies collect amounts due from customers as a result of act 201 the company is permitted to send winter termination notices to customers whose household income exceeds 250 of the federal poverty level and to complete customer terminations without approval from the pa puc the company intends to send termination notices to eligible customers in order to reduce delinquent accounts receivable from customers who have the ability to pay other regulatory changes mandated by act 201 will become effective later in 2005 and beyond and will be implemented by the company as appropriate 

  

equitable gas continues to work with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performancebased rate making in 2001 equitable gas received approval from the pa puc to implement a performancebased purchased gas cost credit incentive that provides to customers a purchased gas cost credit which is fixed in amount while enabling equitable gas to retain all revenues in excess of the credit through more effective management of upstream interstate pipeline capacity this performancebased incentive provides an opportunity for equitable gas to make shortterm releases of unutilized pipeline capacity for a fee and to participate in the bundling of gas supply and pipeline capacity for “offsystem” sales an “offsystem” sale involves the purchase and delivery of gas to a customer at mutually agreedupon points on facilities not owned by the company these revenues are recorded within equitable utilities’ nonjurisdictional operations during the third quarter 2002 the pa puc approved a oneyear extension of this program through september 2004 in that same order the pa puc approved a second performancebased initiative related to balancing services which is available through september 2005 during the second quarter of 2003 equitable gas reached a settlement with all parties to extend its performancebased purchased gas cost credit incentive through september 2005 the settlement also included a new performancebased incentive which allows equitable gas to retain 25 of any revenue generated from a new service designed to increase the recovery of capacity costs from transportation customers a pa puc order approving the settlement was issued in september 2003 this initiative also runs through september 2005 

  

in the third quarter of 2002 the pa puc issued an order approving equitable gas’ request for a delinquency reduction opportunity program the program gives incentives to eligible delinquent customers to make payments exceeding their current bill amount and to receive additional credits from equitable gas to reduce the customer’s balance the program is fully funded through customer contributions and a surcharge in rates 

  

equitable gas submits quarterly purchased gas cost filings to the pa puc that are subject to quarterly reviews and annual audits and prudency reviews by the pa puc and its bureau of audits the pa puc has provided its final prudency review through 2003 in which no material issues were noted the pa puc bureau of audits commenced a purchased gas cost audit for the 20022003 period in the third quarter of 2004 the audit is expected to conclude by the end of the first quarter of 2005

equitrans timely filed its rate case application on december 1 2003 on december 31 2003 in accordance with the natural gas act the ferc issued an order accepting in part and rejecting in part equitrans’ general rate application certain of equitrans’ proposed tariff sheets were accepted subject to a fivemonth suspension period but equitrans’ requests for revenue relief were denied the increases were rejected in large part because equitrans did not provide cost and revenue data for carnegie pipeline equitrans filed a rehearing request on january 30 2004 seeking reconsideration of the ferc’s december 31 2003 order including the ferc’s order requiring a certificate filing to replenish certain storage base gas volumes 

  

equitrans refiled its rate case application on march 1 2004 complete with cost and revenue data for the former carnegie pipeline operations consistent with the company’s original december 1 2003 filing equitrans’ rate case application addresses several issues including establishing an appropriate return on the company’s capital investments the company’s pension funding levels and accruing for postretirement benefits other than pensions the company’s filed request for rate relief is for an aggregate annual amount of approximately 172 million on march 31 2004 in accordance with the natural gas act the ferc issued an order accepting equitrans’ rate application suspending its tariff sheets until september 1 2004 and establishing certain procedural parameters for the case equitrans began charging the proposed rates for its core services subject to refund on september 1 2004 the proposed rates for equitrans’ noncore services were moved into effect subject to refund on december 1 2004 pursuant to commission orders issued on november 23 2004 and december 30 2004 accordingly equitrans has set up a reserve believed by management to be prudent which will be adjusted upon ultimate resolution of the rate case the commission’s november 23 2004 order also denied equitrans’ january 30 2004 rehearing request the company is seeking judicial review of this order but intends to address the replenishment of the storage base gas volumes in conjunction with the resolution of its pending rate case equitrans will continue to explore and evaluate settlement options throughout the pendency of the proceeding

results of operations 

  

equitable utilities 

  

   

equitable utilities had operating income of 1081 million for 2004 compared with 1099 million for 2003 the decreased results for 2004 are primarily due to warmer weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2004 the distribution operations also experienced increased insurance and legal costs operating costs related to the implementation of the customer information system and an increase in pennsylvania franchise tax in february 2004 a rate moratorium for west virginia customers expired the distribution operations subsequently returned to normal gas recovery rates which led to a decrease in margins for the full year these decreases were partially offset by increased gathering revenue at the distribution and pipeline operations and higher storage related margins at the pipeline operations bad debt expense decreased from the prior year primarily due to a reduction of a regulatory asset in the current year partially offset by increases associated with the implementation of the customer information system in the current year which resulted in delays in initiating collection activity   additionally there was a reduction in the distribution operation’s depreciation depletion and amortization dda expenses primarily due to an adjustment in the estimated useful life for equitable gas’ main lines and services lines resulting from the pa puc mandated asset service life study 

  

capital expenditures decreased 41 million to 563 million in 2004 from 604 million in 2003 due to a decrease in technological enhancement project spending partially offset by increased main line replacement costs and new business development spending 

  

operating income for 2003 was 1099 compared with 1019 million for 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to colder weather in the first quarter of 2003 offset somewhat by warmer weather in the second and 

  

  

fourth quarters of 2003 additionally energy marketing experienced an increase in wholesale volumes and margins in both the third and fourth quarters of 2003 these items were offset by an increase in bad debt expense and a decrease in storage related revenues in the pipeline operations the distribution operations also experienced increased operating costs in the first quarter 2003 related to the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls incurred due to the cold weather 

  

capital expenditures decreased 98 million to 604 million in 2003 from 702 million in of 2002 the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in new business development spending and mainline replacement

net operating revenues for 2004 were 1591 million compared to 1652 million in 2003 heating degree days were 5360 in 2004 which is 6 warmer than the 5695 degree days in 2003 the majority of the decrease in net operating revenues is attributable to warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003 that had a negative impact of 46 million and a 05 million favorable 2003 adjustment as a result of a routine pa puc audit of equitable’s gas cost commercial and industrial net operating revenues were down 12 million primarily due to the transfer of responsibility for certain commodity margins to energy marketing related to the agency program whereby energy marketing procures the supply and manages any associated market risk for customers the transportation responsibility related to these customers remains with the distribution operations the related commercial and 

  

  

industrial volumes increased primarily due to low margin industrial usage and therefore had minimal impact on net operating revenues additionally in february 2004 a rate moratorium for west virginia customers expired the distribution operations subsequently returned to normal gas recovery rates this expiration led to a 09 million decrease in margins for the full year these decreases were partially offset by 19 million of gathering revenue related to assets transferred from the pipeline operations during the first quarter of 2004 of the 19 million 05 million related directly to the assets transferred from the pipeline operations for the full year while the remaining 14 million was due to the distribution operations’ ability to increase revenue from the transferred assets as a result of improvements to and further utilization of existing distribution gathering facilities during 2004 

  

operating expenses excluding dda increased by 27 million to 848 million in 2004 from 821 million in 2003 the increase in operating expenses was due to 17 million of higher insurance and legal costs increased operating costs of 11 million related to the implementation of the distribution operation’s customer information system net of decreased mainframe costs of 08 million related to the previous customer information system and an increase in pa franchise tax of 09 million additionally as a result of the flooding which occurred in september 2004 due to hurricane ivan 07 million of expense was incurred primarily related to increased overtime and contractor costs these increases were partially offset by a reduction in cold weatherrelated maintenance costs and ongoing cost reduction initiatives bad debt expense decreased by 17 million from the prior year due to a reduction of a regulatory asset of 75 million in 2004 partially offset by increases of 58 million mainly related to delays in initiating collection activity due to the implementation of the customer information system in 2004 as well as increased gas rates in the current year the reduction in the regulatory asset was due to equitable gas having higher than anticipated recoveries for the delinquency reduction opportunity program through payment and rates dda expense decreased by 25 million from 2003 primarily due to an adjustment in the estimated useful life for equitable gas’ main lines and services lines resulting from the pa puc mandated asset service life study the adjustment made in the fourth quarter 2004 for the full year resulted in a decrease in dda expenses of 35 million this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 10 million related mainly to increased capital in 2004 of which approximately 05 million was related to the implementation of the customer information system 

  

net operating revenues for 2003 were 1652 million compared to 1561 million in 2002 heating degree days were 5695 in 2003 which was 8 cooler than the 5258 degree days in 2002 the colder weather had a positive yearoveryear impact on net operating revenues of approximately 63 million the additional increase in commercial and industrial net operating revenues of 17 million was primarily due to increased delivery margins during the first second and fourth quarters of 2003 despite the 4 decrease in related volumes the related volumes decreased primarily due to low margin industrial usage and therefore had minimal impact on net operating revenues 

  

operating expenses excluding dda increased by 59 million in 2003 from 761 million in 2002 the primary cause for the increase in expenses was an increase of 43 million in bad debt expense which was recorded at approximately 5 of residential revenues combined with higher coldweather related maintenance costs from the first quarter 2003 for the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls these increases were offset by ongoing cost reduction initiatives 

  

pipeline operations 

  

   

  

total transportation throughput decreased 41 million mmbtu or 6 in 2004 from the prior year due primarily to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 this decrease in volumes was partially offset by increased firm transportation to a third party customer because firm transportation contracts which contain fixed monthly fees regardless of the volumes transported constitute most of the pipeline operations’ business the decreased throughput did not negatively impact net operating revenues 

  

net operating revenues from pipeline operations in 2004 increased to 551 million from 529 million in 2003 the increase in net operating revenues was a result of increased storage margins of 15 million in the fourth quarter 2004 additionally gathering revenues increased 12 million due to increased volumes combined with a rate increase in 2004 compared to 2003 this increase was partially offset by a 05 million decrease related to the transfer of gathering assets to the distribution operations in the first quarter 2004 

  

operating expenses excluding dda decreased by 07 million to 225 million in 2004 the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in pipeline maintenance charges combined with ongoing cost reduction initiatives partially offsetting this decrease dda expense increased by 07 million mainly due to increased capital primarily for pipeline replacement and storage enhancement projects 

  

net operating revenues from pipeline operations in 2003 decreased to 529 million from 567 million in 2002 the change in net operating revenues was due almost entirely to a decrease in storage related revenue as a result of firm customer delivery demands in the first quarter of 2003 from colder weather and higher gas prices in addition the high gas prices and lower demand in the second third and fourth quarters of 2003 resulted in the inability to take advantage of commercial opportunities that typically exist 

  

operating expenses excluding dda decreased by 15 million from 247 million in 2002 to 232 million in 2003 the decrease was primarily due to planned maintenance charges related to a pipeline maintenance program recognized in the third quarter of 2002 combined with ongoing cost reduction initiatives 

  

energy marketing 

  

   

net operating revenues increased approximately 15 million in the current year from 270 million in 2003 to 285 million in 2004 this increase was primarily the result of higher commercial and industrial margins which were previously recorded by the distribution operations the increase in volumes over the prior year is primarily attributable to higher offsystem volumes and increased commercial and industrial volumes 

  

operating expenses excluding dda decreased 07 million or 29 from 24 million in 2003 to 17 million in 2004 this decrease is mainly the result of reduced marketing activities related to home gas products and services partially offset by higher legal costs 

  

net operating revenues in 2003 increased to 270 million from 206 million in 2002 or 31 as a result of increased sales for resale off the equitable utilities’ systems increased unit marketing margins and the continued focus on high margin sales through storage optimization and asset management the equitable supply segment assumed the direct marketing of a substantial portion of its operating volumes at the beginning of 2003 which had 

  

  

previously been marketed by energy marketing these volumes totaling approximately 138000 billion british thermal units bbtu in 2003 had been marketed by energy marketing at very low margins although the assumption of these volumes by equitable supply did not have a significant impact on energy marketing’s net operating revenues for the yearended december 31 2003 it was the primary reason for the significant increase in the unit marketing margins during that same period 

  

operating expenses excluding dda decreased by 13 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the recovery of a bankrupt customer’s balance in 2003 that was reserved for in 2002 and a reduction in bad debt expense as well as continued cost reduction initiatives associated with the company’s decision to deemphasize low margin tradingoriented activities 

  

equitable supply 

  

equitable supply consists of two activities production and gathering with operations in the appalachian basin region of the united states equitable production develops produces and sells natural gas and minor amounts of associated crude oil and natural gas liquids equitable gathering engages in natural gas gathering and the processing and sale of natural gas liquids 

  

equitable supply completed several transactions in 2004 2003 and 2002 which affect the comparability of the financial data among those years 

  

prepaid natural gas sales 

  

in 2000 the company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales contracts pursuant to which the company was required to sell and deliver 527 bcf of natural gas during the term of the contracts the first contract was for five years with net proceeds of 1040 million the second contract was for three years with net proceeds of 1048 million and was completed at the end of 2003 these contracts were recorded as prepaid forward sales and the related income was recognized as deliveries occurred 

  

in june 2004 the company continued to evaluate its capital structure as a result of the anticipated increase in liquidity expected from the westportkerrmcgee merger based on this evaluation the company amended the remaining prepaid natural gas contract which had been viewed as debt by the rating agencies the amendment required the company to repay the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to the undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract the company’s obligation to deliver a fixed quantity of gas at a fixed price has not changed but the amendment has the effect of increasing the realized sales price for the delivery of gas for the remaining term of the contract as such the company repaid the counterparty 368 million removed the prepaid forward sale from the consolidated balance sheets and recorded a loss in the second quarter of 2004 of 55 million in other income net in the statements of consolidated income reflecting the difference between the net present value of the underlying quantities and the remaining unamortized balance recorded as deferred revenue prospectively through the term of the remaining contract december 2005 the company will deliver the required quantity of gas at an effective price of 479 per mcf rather than 399 per mcf as originally stated in the contract income will continue to be recognized upon delivery of the gas 

  

sales of gas properties 

  

occasionally the company enters into a sale of gas properties in order to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility to reduce counterparty risk to eliminate production risk and to raise capital while providing the company marketbased fees associated with the gathering marketing and operation of these producing properties 

  

in june 2000 equitable sold properties with 660 bcfe of reserves qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership eastern seven partners lp esp for proceeds of approximately 1222 million and a retained interest in the partnership this sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years the company retained an interest in the partnership that is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the consolidated balance sheets under the equity method of accounting under the terms of the transaction the company’s equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals the company separately negotiated armslength marketbased rates for gathering marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver the partnership’s natural gas to the market the underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term 

  

  

in december 2000 equitable sold properties with 1333 bcfe of reserves to a trust appalachian natural gas trust angt for proceeds of approximately 2558 million and a retained interest in the trust this sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years the company retained an interest in the trust which is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the consolidated balance sheets under the equity method of accounting under the terms of the transaction the company’s equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals the company separately negotiated armslength marketbased rates for gathering marketing and operating fees with the trust in order to deliver the trust’s natural gas to the market the underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal as the operator of the gas properties and as a result of a separate agreement the company receives a marketbased fee for providing a restricted line of credit to the trust that is limited by the fair market value of the trust’s remaining reserves 

  

below is a table that details information associated with the company’s sales of gas properties in 2000 to esp and angt as of december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

in february 2003 the company sold approximately 500 of its lowproducing wells within two of its nonstrategic districts in two separate transactions the sales resulted in a decrease of approximately 13 bcf of net reserves for proceeds of approximately 66 million the wells produced an aggregate of approximately 10 bcf in 2002 the company did not recognize a gain or a loss as a result of this disposition 

  

in january 2005 equitable purchased the 99 limited partnership interest in esp for cash of 575 million and assumed liabilities of 473 million the purchase added approximately 30 bcfe of reserves equitable expects to sell some noncore producing properties during the first half of 2005 the net result of the purchase and sale is expected to increase the sales volume at equitable supply to 73 bcfe in 2005 the expected increased revenues will be partially offset by lower other revenues from fees formerly paid by esp for marketing and operating services 

  

appalachian basin partners lp 

  

in november 1995 the company monetized appalachian gas properties qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership appalachian basin partners lp abp the company recorded the proceeds as deferred revenue which was recognized as production occurred the company retained a partnership interest in the properties that increased substantially at the end of 2001 based on the attainment of a performance target the company consolidated the partnership starting in 2002 and the remaining portion not owned by the company was recorded as minority interest 

  

as a result of the company’s increased partnership interest in abp in 2002 the company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to abp this resulted in a reduction of the company’s effective tax rate during 2002 the nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002 and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future 

  

in february 2003 the company purchased the remaining 31 limited partnership interest in abp from the minority interest holders for 442 million the 31 limited partnership interest represented approximately 602 bcf of reserves as a result effective february 1 2003 the company no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with abp which totaled 09 million and 71 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

  

capital expenditures 

  

equitable supply forecasts its 2005 capital expenditures to be approximately 219 million which excludes the 575 million purchase of esp in january 2005 the forecast includes 133 million for the development of appalachian holdings and 86 million for improvements and extensions to gathering system pipelines the 133 million targeted to the development of appalachian holdings represents a 42 million increase in capital expenditures from 2004 to 2005 attributable to an expanded drilling program in virginia west virginia and kentucky the evaluation of new development locations market forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering system investments 

  

other 

  

equitable supply implemented a significant change to its business model in late 2004 previously equitable supply followed an operating cost minimization strategy combined with a moderate drilling program the company’s new strategy focuses on profit maximization rather than cost minimization as an objective equitable supply’s previous strategy was based on low price assumptions to assume low prices however in spite of current market conditions limits opportunities the margin leverage from realizable gas prices substantially outweighs the modest increase in unit cost structure necessary to utilize this strategy in the second quarter of 2004 the company reduced the expected number of wells to be drilled in 2004 from 340 to 320 consistent with the increased focus on infrastructure this year this change was intended to accelerate sales from existing wells to reduce the company’s longterm requirement for maintenance capital with respect to these wells and to provide a platform for higher drilling levels prospectively with the significant and sustained increase in nymex natural gas prices during the past several months the company reevaluated its growth strategy by providing for a stable base infrastructure for the current natural gas wells the company can benefit from the higher gas prices by obtaining accelerated volumes from the current wells and by increasing the number of wells it intends to drill in 2005 and beyond at a nymex price of 600 in addition to the 1441 net proved undeveloped drilling locations the company believes that it has available on acreage it controls at least 7000 additional net drilling locations on unproved properties the execution of this new model will be challenging and will result in higher operating expense but the company is committed to improving outcomes through actions such as 1 significantly increasing the company’s focus on well performance by lowering bottomhole pressure 2 accelerating implementation and installation of compressor stations and facilities to lower surface pressure 3 reducing internal and external curtailments of gas sales 4 reducing “lost” gas to the minimum level that can be justified economically and not accepting “unaccounted for” gas and 5 increasing accountability ownership and attention to detail in the field and engineering areas 

  

equitable supply 

  

operational and financial data 

  

   

a   2003 capital expenditures include the purchase of the remaining 31 limited partnership interest in abp 442 million which was separately approved by the board of directors of the company in addition to the total amount originally authorized for the 2003 capital budget program 

  

  

   

equitable supply’s operating income for 2004 totaled 2274 million 16 higher than the 1958 million earned in 2003 the segment’s 2004 net operating revenues were 3904 million 17 higher than the 2003 net operating revenues of 3324 million the increases in equitable supply’s operating income and net operating revenues were primarily the result of a 14 higher average wellhead sales price a 5 increase in sales volumes and a 7 increase in gathering revenues 

  

equitable supply’s average wellhead sales price realized on produced volumes for 2004 was 446 per mcfe compared to 391 per mcfe for 2003 the 055 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price was attributable to higher gas commodity prices increased volumes at higher hedged prices and increased basis over the same period in 2003 the 5 increase in sales volumes was primarily the result of new wells drilled in 2003 and 2004 and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells the 7 increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to a 5 increase in the average gathering rate and higher equitable production sales volumes partially offset by third party customer volume shutins 

  

total operating expenses were 1631 million for 2004 compared to 1366 million for 2003 an increase of 19 the increase in gathering and compression costs was primarily attributable to an increase in compressor station operation and repair costs field labor and related employments costs field line maintenance costs and compressor electricity charges the increase in dda resulted from a 005 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes the increase in severance taxes a tax imposed on the value of gas extracted was primarily attributable to higher gas commodity prices and sales volumes the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily the result of a charge for environmental site assessments and increased property taxes and liability insurance premiums the increase in sga was due to increased franchise taxes in 2004  

  

other income net was the result of a 61 million settlement received from a previously disputed insurance coverage claim offset by a 55 million expense related to the company’s settlement of its prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004 

  

capital expenditures decreased from 2045 million in 2003 to 1417 million in 2004 primarily as a result of a decrease in the level of development drilling in the appalachian holdings to allow equitable supply to concentrate on its core assets and insure a proper level of return on all new projects the capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003 included 915 million and 1260 million respectively for the development of appalachian holdings and 502 million and 343 million respectively for gathering system improvements and extensions 

  

equitable supply had operating income of 1958 million for 2003 compared with 1712 million in 2002 the increase was primarily due to a 044 per mcfe increase in average wellhead sales price a 4 increase in sales volumes and a 10 increase in revenues from gathering partially offset by an increase in operating expenses the net increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in lease operating expenses severance taxes higher dda resulting from a 009 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes 

  

  

and higher gathering and compression expenses mainly attributable to an increase in gathering fees paid to third parties the increase in severance taxes was primarily attributable to higher gas commodity prices the increase in lease operating expenses was primarily the result of an increase in road maintenance and other repair costs due to severe weather and flooding in 2003 and increases in property taxes and liability insurance premiums sga costs remained consistent from 2002 to 2003 as a result of a reduction in legal claims and reserves being offset by a 20 million loss incurred during 2003 on the early termination of an uneconomic sales contract 

  

capital expenditures increased from 1475 million in 2002 to 2045 million in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in the level of development drilling in the appalachian holdings and the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in abp for 442 million the capital expenditures in 2003 and 2002 included 1260 million and 1144 million respectively for the development of appalachian holdings and 343 million and 331 million respectively for gathering system improvements and extensions 

  

equitable production 

  

operational and financial data 

  

   

a   effective january 1 2003 the company adjusted its method for using a natural gas equivalents conversion factor to convert gallons of liquid hydrocarbon sales to equivalent volumes of natural gas sales this change results in an additional 03 bcfe natural gas sales volume and a corresponding reduction to reported company usage and line loss for the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease in company usage and line loss for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to year ended december 31 2003 was primarily due to improved meter calibration on the company’s wells 

  

b   natural gas and oil production represents the company’s interest in gas and oil production measured at the wellhead it is equal to the sum of total sales volumes company usage line loss and natural gas inventory 

  

c   includes volumes in which interests were sold but which the company still operates for third parties for a fee see the esp and angt table in the “sale of gas properties” section for additional information 

  

  

   

equitable production’s total production revenues which are derived primarily from the sale of produced natural gas increased 534 million from 2003 to 2004 the increase was primarily the result of a 14 increase in the average wellhead sales price of 446 per mcfe compared to 391 per mcfe in the prior year and increased sales volumes of 34 bcfe the increase in sales volumes was the result of new wells drilled in 2003 and 2004 reduction in the average line pressure in the gathering system by 13 and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells 

  

production operating revenues were also positively impacted in 2004 by the recognition of a gain of 27 million that resulted from the renegotiation of a processing agreement the company received approximately 33 million from a contract buydown fee related to the renegotiation of a preexisting liquids processing agreement from a makewhole arrangement to a processing fee arrangement under the terms of the new agreement equitable will have increased exposure to liquids prices and will pay a fee on volumes processed this 33 million was partially offset by a 06 million write down of certain plant assets that no longer have future economic value under the new agreement 

  

operating expenses increased 131 million or 15 over the prior year from 902 million to 1033 million this increase was primarily due to a 53 million increase in dda costs a 38 million increase in severance taxes attributable to higher natural gas prices and increased sales volume and a 38 million increase in lease operating expenses the increase in dda was primarily due to a 005 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes the 005 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate was the result of the net development capital additions in 2003 on a relatively consistent proved reserve base the increase in lease operating expenses was due to a charge to earnings for environmental site assessments performed in accordance with the company’s amended spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc compliance plan and increased property taxes and liability insurance premiums in general the higher cost structure reflects the change in the strategy from cost minimization previously addressed 

  

other income net was the result of a 61 million settlement received from a disputed insurance coverage claim offset by a 55 million expense related to the company’s amendment of its prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004 

  

total production revenues increased 369 million from 2002 to 2003 the increase was primarily the result of a 374 million increase in production revenues from 2002 due to a higher average wellhead sales price of 391 per mcfe compared to 347 per mcfe in the prior year and increased sales volumes of 26 bcfe 

  

  

operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 21 as compared to the same period in 2002 this increase was primarily due to a 76 million increase in dda costs 53 million in higher severance taxes attributable to higher natural gas prices and a 33 million increase in lease operating expenses 

  

equitable gathering 

  

operational and financial data 

  

   

a   revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect process and deliver natural gas from the field where it is produced to the trunk or main transmission line many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price in which case the company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components 

  

   

equitable gathering’s total operating revenues increased 46 million or 7 from 698 million in 2003 to 744 million in 2004 the 7 increase in total operating revenues was primarily attributable to a 6 rise in the average gathering fee and a 07 bcf increase in gathered volumes the increase in gathered volumes was the result of higher equitable production sales volumes partially offset by third party customer volume shutins caused by extended maintenance projects on interstate pipelines 

  

total operating expenses increased 133 million or 29 from 464 million in 2003 to 597 million in 2004 the increase resulted from a 104 million increase in gathering and compression costs a 18 million increase in depreciation relating to capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions and a 11 million increase in sga expense the increase in gathering and compression costs was primarily attributable to an increase in compressor station operation and repair costs field labor and related employment costs field line maintenance costs and compressor electricity charges resulting from newly installed electric compressors the additional compression costs resulted from a 24 increase in horsepower hp to approximately 112000 hp in 2004 from approximately 90000 hp in 2003 the increase in field labor was due to an increase in headcount related to equitable gathering’s current strategy to spend more time and resources to aggressively tend to the improvement of the base infrastructure actions taken by equitable gathering to support this strategy such as the installation of compressor stations and facilities to reduce surface pressure and efforts related to reducing the internal curtailment 

  

  

of gas sales have increased compression and field line maintenance costs in 2004 equitable gathering will pursue recovery of the increased cost to provide gathering services through the rates it charges to its customers the increase in sga costs was primarily attributable to an increase in franchise taxes due to an increase in the tax base 

  

equitable gathering’s total operating revenues increased 65 million or 10 from 633 million in 2002 to 698 million in 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to a 8 rise in the average gathering fee billed to equity and third party customers in addition to a 31 bcfe increase in gathered volumes resulting from higher equitable production volumes and new third party customers in southern west virginia 

  

total operating expenses increased to 464 million in 2003 from 434 million in 2002 a 7 increase year over year primarily due to higher third party gathering costs other gathering and compression expense increases and higher depreciation relating to capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions 

  

noresco 

  

noresco provides an integrated group of energyrelated products and services that are designed to reduce its customers’ operating costs and improve their energy efficiency the segment’s activities comprise performance contracting energy efficiency programs combined heat and power and central boilerchiller plant development design construction ownership and operation noresco’s customers include governmental military institutional commercial and industrial endusers 

  

on september 30 2003 the enabling legislation for the performance contracting work that noresco performs for the federal government under the department of energy contracts lapsed on october 28 2004 the president signed legislation extending the contracting period for performance contracting at federal government facilities through october 2006 

  

  

   

   

  

revenues decreased to 1464 million in 2004 from 1707 million in 2003 a decrease of 243 million or 14 this decrease was due primarily to decreased construction activity mainly related to reduced sales during the year gross profit margin decreased to 393 million compared to 410 million in the same period last year gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 27 in 2004 from 24 in 2003 reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year 

  

revenue backlog decreased to 835 million at yearend 2004 from 1342 million at yearend 2003 this decrease in backlog was primarily due to the inability to contract with the federal government between september 30 2003 and october 28 2004 

  

total operating expenses increased by 03 million from 241 million in 2003 to 244 million in 2004 this increase was primarily due to an increase in sga expenses which includes expenses related to the litigation regarding ealeri cogeneration partners lp jamaica included in sga expenses in 2003 was 08 million related to the consolidation of the energy infrastructure and performance contracting groups excluding these isolated items sga expenses were flat compared to prior year 

  

during the second quarter of 2004 several negative circumstances caused the company to evaluate its international investments for additional impairments and to accelerate its plans to exit the international generation business see “equity in nonconsolidated investments” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the 396 million impairment charge recorded in 2004 equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of 12 million in 2004 and 25 million in 2003 reflects noresco’s share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets the decrease in earnings from 2003 was primarily due to the company’s strategy to exit the international generation business 

  

the company began recording minority interest expense upon the consolidation of hunterdon cogeneration lp hunterdon in june 2003 the increase in minority interest expense from 05 million in 2003 to 10 million in 2004 was due to the consolidation of hunterdon for six months in 2003 versus a full calendar year in 2004 

  

revenues decreased to 1707 million in 2003 from 1901 million in 2002 a decrease of 194 million or 10 this decrease was due primarily to decreased construction activity for energy infrastructure projects versus 2002 gross profit margins increased to 24 in 2003 from 21 in 2002 reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year gross profit margin in 2002 included a demand side management program that contributed 24 million in 2002 and was terminated at the end of the year gross profit margins trended upwards over 2002 due to the focus on more profitable performance contracting contracts as contrasted with less profitable energy infrastructure construction 

  

revenue backlog increased to 1342 million at yearend 2003 from 1182 million at yearend 2002 the increase in backlog was primarily due to the award of federal government contracts in 2003 

  

total operating expenses decreased by 64 million from 305 million in 2002 to 241 million in 2003 this decrease was primarily due to the 53 million impairment charge for the jamaica power plant project in 2002 additionally sga expenses decreased to 227 million in 2003 from 235 million in 2002 included in sga expenses in 2003 was 08 million related to the consolidation of the energy infrastructure and performance contracting groups and included in 2002 was 10 million related to office consolidations the remaining 06 million decrease in sga was primarily due to a reduction in labor costs 

  

equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of 25 million in 2003 and 47 million in 2002 reflects noresco’s share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets the decrease in earnings was primarily due to decreased earnings from the petroelectrica de panama ldc panamanian power plant because of the expiration of its power purchase agreement revenue in 2003 from a replacement agreement was lower than that recognized in 2002 earnings were also lower due to the consolidation of hunterdon cogeneration lp hunterdon and plymouth cogeneration lp plymouth in 2003 these consolidations as more fully described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements required noresco to recognize minority interest expense of 05 million in 2003 

  

  

the company reviewed its equity investment related to petroelectrica de panama ldc an independent power plant in panama during the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of the analysis performed an impairment of 111 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 was recorded which represented the full value of noresco’s equity investment in the project

income from discontinued operations 

  

in december 1998 the company sold its natural gas midstream operations a capital loss in connection with the sale was treated as a nondeductible item for tax reporting purposes under the then current treasury regulations embodying the “loss disallowance rule” resulting in additional tax recorded on this sale as a reduction to net income from discontinued operations in may 2002 the internal revenue service irs issued new treasury regulations interpreting the “loss disallowance rule” so as to permit this capital loss to be treated as deductible during june 2002 the company filed amended 1998 tax return filings consequently in the second quarter 2002 the company recorded a 90 million increase in net income from discontinued operations related to this unexpected tax benefit 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

operating activities 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 1764 million in 2004 as compared to 1210 million in 2003 a 554 million increase between years the company had increased collections from customers in 2004 as compared to 2003 driven primarily by increased net operating revenues in the company’s supply segment during the year ended december 31 2003 the company made cash contributions totaling 518 million to its pension plan while the company did not make any such contributions in 2004 these increases in cash flow provided by operating activities were offset by a decrease in cash from operations of 368 million in 2004 resulting from the company’s amendment of the prepaid forward contract in the second quarter of 2004 cash flows from operations were also affected by other working capital changes during 2004 

  

when the company’s two prepaid forward gas sale transactions were originally consummated in january of 2001 the company reviewed the specific facts and circumstances related to these transactions to determine if the appropriate statements of consolidated cash flows presentation would be as an operating activity or a financing activity the company concluded that the appropriate accounting presentation of the prepaid forward gas sales transactions was as an operating cash flow item consistent with the company’s previous presentation the current presentation includes recognition of prepaid forward production revenues in operating activities one of the company’s two prepaid forward gas sales contracts expired on december 31 2003 in june 2004 the remaining prepaid forward contract was amended which resulted in the company repaying the net present value of the portion of the prepayment related to undelivered quantities of natural gas in the original contract as stated previously this amendment resulted in the company repaying 368 million and recognizing a loss of 55 million on the settlement 

  

  

of the prepaid contract as a result of the expiration of one prepaid contract and the amendment of the other there was 453 million less prepaid forward production revenue recognized in 2004 compared to the prior year 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 1210 million in 2003 as compared to 2145 million in 2002 the 935 million decrease in operating cash flows from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of the decrease in cash provided from working capital due to a large increase in inventory during 2003 as compared to a slight decrease in inventory during 2002 the increase in inventory was mainly due to increased natural gas prices and volumes stored in 2003 compared to the prior year in addition the company made 518 million in pension contributions during 2003 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash flows used in investing activities totaled 1579 million in 2004 as compared to 2143 million in 2003 and 1692 million in 2002 

  

the company expended approximately 2024 million in 2004 for capital expenditures as compared to 2657 million in 2003 and 2185 million in 2002 equitable supply spent 1417 million in 2004 of which 915 million was spent on developmental drilling and 502 million was spent on infrastructure projects equitable utilities spent 563 million in 2004 of which 485 million was spent on infrastructure projects 32 million was spent on technology projects and 46 million was spent on business development capital expenditures for equitable supply in 2003 included 442 million used for the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in abp in february 2003 

  

the company also received proceeds of 429 million in 2004 from the sale of 800000 shares of the company’s investment in kerrmcgee 

  

in 2003 the sale of approximately 148 million shares of westport stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 provided 384 million of proceeds in addition proceeds of 44 million were provided by the sale of the company’s 50 interest in an equity investment in october 2003 and proceeds of 66 million were provided by the sale of wells in ohio in february 2003 

  

cash used in 2002 investing activities included 176 million invested in availableforsale securities intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the company selfinsures 

  

cash provided by investing activities in 2002 included 630 million of proceeds from the sale of oildominated fields within equitable supply in december 2001 the company sold its oildominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities the sale resulted in a decrease of 63 bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves these proceeds were held in a restricted cash account at december 31 2001 for use in a potential likekind exchange for certain identified assets during 2002 the restrictions lapsed and the cash was made available for operations 

  

a total of 293 million was authorized for the 2005 capital budget program as previously described in the business segment results the company expects to finance this program with cash generated from operations and with shortterm debt see discussion in the “shortterm borrowings” section below regarding the financing capacity of the company 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash flows used in financing activities totaled 558 million in 2004 as compared to 1129 million of cash flows provided by financing activities in 2003 and 572 million of cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 

  

the increase in cash flows used in financing activities from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to the following items during 2004 and 2003 the company repurchased 24 million and 14 million shares of its outstanding common stock for 1185 million and 552 million respectively resulting in a 633 million increase in cash flows used cash flows used in financing activities also increased due to a 290 million increase in 

  

  

dividends paid in 2004 and a 750 million increase in longterm debt during 2003 due to the issuance of 200 million of notes and the redemption of 125 million of trust preferred securities 

  

the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of increased borrowing in 2003 as compared to 2002 shortterm borrowing activity resulted in a net cash inflow of 936 million in 2003 compared to a net cash outflow of 1694 million in the prior year the increase in cash flows from shortterm borrowing activity in 2003 was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by longterm debt as compared to the prior year the company issued 200 million of notes in february 2003 with a stated interest rate of 515 and a maturity date of march 2018 the proceeds from this issuance were used to retire the company’s 125 million of 735 trust preferred securities on april 23 2003 this provided a net cash increase from the longterm debt issuance of 75 million in 2003 compared to a 200 million increase in 2002 relating to the november 2002 issuance of 515 notes the 200 million longterm debt issuance in november 2002 was used to repay a significant portion of commercial paper and shortterm loans other repayments and retirements of longterm debt were 247 million in 2003 compared to 06 million in 2002 additionally loan proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the sale of contract receivables were 455 million in 2003 compared to 232 million in 2002 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices shortterm loans are used mainly to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season 

  

the company believes that it has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing requirements bank loans and commercial paper supported by available credit are used to meet shortterm financing requirements interest rates on these shortterm loans averaged 17 during 2004 the company maintains with a group of banks a threeyear revolving credit agreement providing 500 million of available credit that expires in 2006 the credit agreement may be used for among other things credit support for the company’s commercial paper program as of december 31 2004 the company has the authority to arrange for a commercial paper program up to 650 million the amount of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2004 is 2955 million 

  

due to continued increases in natural gas prices during 2004 and resulting increases in the company’s net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements the company has borrowed additional amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its margin deposits under its exchangetraded natural gas agreements see further discussion below under “inflation and the effect of changing energy prices” 

  

in july of 2004 the company entered into three 75 year secured variable share forward transactions to hedge cash flow exposure associated with the forecasted future disposal of kerrmcgee shares see note 3 to the company’s consolidated financial statements each transaction permits receipt of an amount up to the net present value of the floor price prior to maturity the economic characteristics of any receipt would be considered that of a borrowing 

  

the company’s credit ratings as determined by either standard  poor’s or moody’s on its noncreditenhanced senior unsecured longterm debt determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit the lower the company’s credit rating the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate as of december 31 2004 the company had not borrowed any amounts against these lines of credit facility fees averaging oneeleventh of one percent in both 2004 and 2003 were paid to maintain credit availability 

  

the company believes that cash generated from operations amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position are more than adequate to meet the company’s reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements 

  

  

financing triggers 

  

the indentures and other agreements governing the company’s indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict the company’s ability to incur indebtedness incur liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions complete acquisitions sell assets and certain other corporate actions the covenants do not contain a rating trigger therefore in the event that the company’s debt rating changes this event would not trigger a default under the indentures and other agreements governing the company’s indebtedness 

  

inflation and the effect of changing energy prices 

  

due to the nature of the company’s operations fluctuations in natural gas prices can significantly impact its operating cash flows and consequently the availability of funds for use in both investing and financing activities as a result of the increase in natural gas prices during the past several months the company’s liquidity position could be negatively affected by further increases the increase in natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs as the demand for well drilling operations continues to increase increased deferral of purchased gas costs for the distribution operations however purchased gas costs are subsequently recoverable from utility customers in future months through gas cost adjustment clauses included in the distribution operation’s filed rate tariffs increased severance taxes as the company is subject to higher severance taxes due to increased volumes of gas extracted from the wells combined with increased value of the gas extracted from the wells increased lease operating expenses due to increased demand for lease operating services and increased exposure to credit losses resulting from potential increases in uncollectible accounts receivable from the distribution operation’s customers the company’s risk management program and available borrowing capacity currently in place provide means for the company to manage these risks furthermore the inventory owned by the company as reserves or in storage increases in value thus increasing the creditworthiness of the company and facilitating its ability to access the credit markets for additional liquidity if needed 

  

due to continued increases in natural gas prices and resulting increases in the company’s net liability position under its natural gas swap agreements the company has borrowed additional amounts through its commercial paper program to fund its margin deposits under its exchangetraded natural gas agreements when the net fair value of any of the swap agreements represents a liability to the company which is in excess of the agreedupon threshold between the company and the financial institution acting as counterparty the counterparty requires the company to remit funds to the counterparty as a margin deposit for the derivative liability which is in excess of the threshold amount the margin deposits are remitted back to the company in part or in full when the excess of the derivative liability over the agreedupon threshold is reduced below the amount deposited the company has recorded such deposits in the amount of 360 million as accounts receivable in its consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2004 

  

commodity risk management 

  

the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices the company hedges natural gas through financial instruments including forward contracts swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements 

  

the fair value of these derivative commodity instruments was a 268 million asset and a 3504 million liability as of december 31 2004 and a 345 million asset and a 1376 million liability as of december 31 2003 these amounts are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as derivative commodity instruments at fair value the net amount of derivative commodity instruments at fair value increased from a net liability of 1031 million at december 31 2003 to a net liability of 3236 million at december 31 2004 primarily as a result of the increase in natural gas prices the absolute quantities of the company’s derivative commodity instruments that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges total 4326 bcf and 3472 bcf as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively and primarily relate to natural gas swaps the open swaps at december 31 2004 have maturities extending through 2011 

  

  

equitable has taken advantage of favorable gas prices to significantly hedge production as of december 31 2004 the approximate volumes and prices of equitable’s hedges and fixedprice contracts for 2005 – 2007 are 

  

   

 the above price is based on a conversion rate of 105 mmbtumcf 

  

with respect to hedging the company’s exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices management’s objective is to provide price protection for the majority of expected production for the years 2005 through 2008 and for over 25 of expected equity production for the years 2009 through 2011 the company’s exposure to a 010 change in average nymex natural gas price is approximately 001 per diluted share in 2005 and 002 to 003 per diluted share for 2006 and 2007 although the company uses derivative instruments that create a price floor in order to provide downside protection while allowing the company to participate in upward price movements through the use of collars and straight floors the preponderance of instruments tend to be fixed price swaps or nymextraded forwards this approach avoids the higher cost of option instruments but limits the upside potential the current high nymex gas prices may cause the company to rely less heavily on natural gas swap agreements and futures contracts the company also engages in basis swaps to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of geographic disparities in commodity prices 

  

investment securities

equity in nonconsolidated investments   certain noresco projects are conducted through nonconsolidated entities that consist of private power generation facilities located in select international locations during the second quarter of 2004 several negative circumstances caused the company to reassess its international investments for additional impairments and to accelerate its plans to exit the international generation business changes in pricing in the electricity power market in panama during the second quarter of 2004 negatively impacted the outlook for operations of igceri pan am thermal generating limited pan am a panamanian electric generation project as a result the company performed an impairment analysis of its equity interest in this project this involved preparing a probabilityweighted cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and comparing this amount to the book value of the equity investment the probabilityweighted cash flows resulted in a lower fair value than the carrying value and an impairment was deemed necessary an impairment of 221 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2004 and represents the full value of noresco’s equity investment in the project

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” fin no 46 fin no 46 required certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity did not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or did not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties prior to fin no 46 an entity was generally consolidated by an enterprise when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity fin no 46 was effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 the company adopted fin no 46 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 as of july 1 2003 the adoption of fin no 46 required the consolidation of plymouth cogeneration limited partnership plymouth a joint venture entered into by noresco and the deconsolidation of ealeri cogeneration partners lp jamaica which is the partnership that holds the jamaican power plant 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued a revision to fin no 46 fin no 46r that modified some of the provisions of fin no 46 and provided exemptions to certain entities from the original guidance the company adopted fin no 46r in the first quarter of 2004 the adoption of fin no 46r required the company to deconsolidate plymouth as of january 1 2004 due to certain modifications of the original fin no 46 provisions

on june 17 2004 the fasb issued an exposure draft “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” the proposed interpretation would clarify that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity that is conditional on a future event is within the scope of fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” a recording of the liability at fair value would be recognized for a conditional asset retirement obligation when the liability is incurred certain factors regarding the timing and method of the settlement which are conditional upon the future events occurring would be factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the recognition of the liability the final rules are expected to be 

  

  

issued in early 2005 and are anticipated to be effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after december 15 2005 the company will evaluate the impact of any change in accounting standard on the company’s financial position and results of operations when the final rules are issued 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company issued a liquidity reserve guarantee to anpi which is subject to certain restrictions and limitations and is secured by the fair market value of the assets purchased by angt the company received a marketbased fee for the issuance of the reserve guarantee as of december 31 2004 the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under the liquidity reserve guarantee is estimated to be 29 million the company has not recorded a liability for this guarantee as the guarantee was issued prior to the effective date of fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin no 45 and has not been modified subsequent to issuance 

  

the company has certain minority investments representing ownership interests in transactions by which natural gas producing properties located in the appalachian basin region of the united states were sold the company has entered into agreements with these entities to provide gathering and operating services to deliver their gas to market in addition the company receives a marketing fee for the sale of gas based on the net revenue for gas delivered the total revenue earned from these fees totaled approximately 249 million for the year ended december 31 2004 revenue from these fees will be affected by the purchase of the 99 limited partnership interest in esp which occurred in january 2005 and is more fully discussed under the section “equitable supply” 

  

in order to accelerate cash collections the noresco segment executes transactions to sell certain contract receivables to a financial institution and a variable interest entity the variable interest entity is a multiseller conduit that purchases contract receivables from several energy companies the company has no ownership interest in or control of the variable interest entity as further described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company does not retain any interest in the contract receivables once the sale is complete for the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 538 million of the contract receivables met the criteria for sales treatment 

  

pension plans 

  

the company made cash contributions totaling 496 million to its pension plan during the first three quarters of 2003 in accordance with current funding guidelines these contributions were designated as 2002 plan year contributions and in the aggregate represent the maximum allowable contribution that the company could make to its pension plan for that plan year in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company made an additional cash contribution totaling 22 million to its pension plan in accordance with current funding guidelines this contribution was designated as a 2003 plan year contribution as a result of the cash contributions the company’s minimum funding requirement was zero for the 2004 plan year the company was not required to and consequently did not make any contribution to its pension plans during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2002 the company expects to make a cash contribution of 103 million to its pension plan during 2005 to fully fund the cash balance participants portion of the pension plan which was settled effective december 31 2004 

  

the following benefit payments which reflect expected future service and the final settlement of the cash balance portion of the pension plan in 2005 are expected to be paid during each of the next five years and the five years thereafter 282 million in 2005 82 million in 2006 81 million in 2007 77 million in 2008 83 million in 2009 and 375 million in the five years thereafter 

  

the reduction in the fair market value of the company’s pension plan assets over the period of 2000 to 2002 coupled with decreases in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and increases in the amount of unrecognized actuarial losses has also contributed to increases in the amount of pension expense recognized by the company total pension expense recognized by the company in 2004 2003 and 2002 excluding special termination benefits onetime settlement expenses and curtailment losses totaled 08 million 51 million and 53 million respectively in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company froze the pension benefit provided through a 

  

  

defined benefit plan to approximately 340 nonrepresented employees the company now provides benefits to these employees under a defined contribution plan that covers all other nonrepresented employees of the company in the fourth quarter of 2004 the company irrevocably committed to settle the pension obligation of those nonrepresented employees whose benefits were frozen in 2003 as a result of this settlement which was accounted for under sfas no 88 “employer’s accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” the company recognized a onetime settlement expense of 134 million as of december 31 2004 the settlement expense that was recognized for these nonrepresented employees was primarily the result of accelerated recognition of approximately 110 million in previously deferred unrecognized losses the accelerated recognition of the previously deferred unrecognized losses along with a reduced number of retirees obtaining benefits in the future will decrease the expected amount of pension expense to be recognized by the company in future years as a result of this settlement the projected benefit obligation of the pension plan is expected to be reduced by approximately 196 million additionally the pension settlement expense is an unallocated expense in deriving total operating income for segment reporting purposes see note 2 to the company’s consolidated financial statements additionally the projected future pension expense is expected to decrease as a result of the settlement of the cash balance portion of the pension plan 

  

incentive compensation 

  

the company continues to shift its compensation focus from stock options to performancebased stock units and timerestricted stock awards management and the board of directors believe that such an incentive compensation approach more closely aligns management’s incentives with shareholder rewards than is the case with traditional stock options the company has long utilized timerestricted stock in its compensation plans but only began issuing performancerestricted units in 2002 and has now fully transitioned to a longterm incentive approach that is limited to performancerestricted stock or units and timerestricted stock no stock options were awarded in 2004 

  

the company recorded the following incentive compensation expense for the periods indicated below 

  

   

much of the 177 million increase from 2003 to 2004 was due directly and indirectly to the culmination of the kerrmcgeewestport merger the longterm incentive compensation expenses are primarily associated with executive performance incentive programs that were instituted starting in 2002 the company currently estimates 2005 total incentive compensation expense of approximately 34 million 

  

on february 23 2005 the compensation committee of the board of directors adopted the 2005 executive performance incentive program 2005 program under the 1999 long term incentive plan the 2005 program was established to provide additional incentive benefits to retain executive officers and certain other employees of the company to further align the interests of the persons primarily responsible for the success of the company with the interests of the shareholders under the program a maximum of 600000 stock units may be granted among a maximum of forty participants the vesting of these stock units will occur on december 31 2008 contingent upon a combination of the level of total shareholder return relative to 29 peer companies and the company’s average absolute return on total capital during the four year performance period as a result zero to 1500000 units 250 of the units available for grant may be distributed in cash or stock the 29 peer companies are identical to the peer group identified for the 2003 executive performance incentive program in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements except for the exclusion of nui corp the 2005 program will be accounted for as a variable plan and expensed over the four year performance period based on anticipated stock price and expected level of performance 

  

federal legislation 

  

as a result of the company’s increased partnership interest in abp in 2002 the company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to abp this resulted in a reduction of the company’s effective tax rate during 2002 the nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002 and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future on november 18 2003 the energy policy act of 2003 hr 6 was passed by the house of representatives this comprehensive energy policy legislation as reported by conferees from the house of representatives and the senate included an extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit for existing qualifying wells and for newly drilled qualifying wells the senate was unable to pass hr 6 before adjourning for 2003 due to a lack of votes needed to avoid a threatened filibuster energy tax legislation continues to be discussed by the senate and house of representatives from time to time but any extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit continues to remain uncertain 

  

on september 30 2003 the enabling legislation for the performance contracting work that noresco performs for the federal government under the department of energy contracts lapsed on october 28 2004 the 

  

  

president signed legislation extending the contracting period for performance contracting at federal government facilities through october 2006 

  

during october 2004 congress passed the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs creation act which the president signed into law on october 22 2004 the jobs creation act is the first major corporate tax act in a number of years some of the key provisions of the jobs creation act include a new domestic manufacturing deduction a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings oil and gas producer incentives not an extension of the nonconventional fuels tax credit new tax shelter penalties restrictions on deferred compensation and numerous other issuespecific provisions aimed at specific transactions the only item in this legislation impacting the company’s consolidated financial statements during 2004 was the temporary incentive to repatriate foreign earnings see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

rate regulation 

  

the company’s distribution operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc and the public service commission of west virginia and to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission the company’s interstate pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc accounting for the company’s regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 71 “accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation” as described in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

schedule of contractual obligations 

  

the following table details the future projected payments associated with the company’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 

  

   

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as a limited amount of equipment in the third quarter of 2003 the company entered into a longterm lease with continental real estate companies continental to occupy office space in a building at the north shore in pittsburgh this action will help consolidate the company’s administrative operations continental is constructing and will own the office building which is expected to be completed in 2005 the term of the lease is 20 years and nine months and the base rent is approximately 2 million per year relocation of operations from locations that utilize space under longterm leases will likely cause additional expense in 2005 the base rent payments of approximately 2 million per year have been included in the table above with payments commencing in 2006 

  

included within the purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately 297 million relating to the company’s natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing longterm contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to eleven years at december 31 2004 approximately 203 million of these costs are believed to be recoverable in customer rates 

  

the other longterm liabilities line represents the total estimated payout for the 2003 executive performance incentive program payable in the first quarter of 2006 see section titled “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding factors that affect the ultimate amount of payout under this program 

  

  

contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

in the ordinary course of business various legal claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company while the amounts claimed may be substantial the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings the company has established reserves for pending litigation which it believes are adequate and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position of the company 

  

after an extended period of troubled operations eri jam llc a subsidiary that holds the company’s interest in ealeri cogeneration partners lp an international infrastructure project located in jamaica filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 in us bankruptcy court delaware in april 2003 in the third quarter 2003 eri jam llc transferred control of the international infrastructure project under the partnership agreement to the other nonaffiliate general partner the international infrastructure project was deconsolidated in accordance with fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” in september 2003 projectlevel counterparties jamaica broilers group limited jbg and energy associated limited eal filed a claim against eri jam llc as debtorinpossession in the chapter 11 case eal an affiliate of jbg is a limited partner in ealeri cogeneration partners lp in october 2003 jbg and eal also filed a multicount complaint seeking damages against equitable and certain of its affiliates in us district court western district of pennsylvania alleging breach of contract tortious interference with contractual relations negligence and a variety of related claims with respect to the operation and management of ealeri cogeneration partners lp equitable filed a motion to dismiss in september 2004 and subsequently agreed in principle with jbg and eal to settle the litigation the parties are currently negotiating the terms of a settlement agreement 

  

the various regulatory authorities that oversee equitable’s operations will from time to time make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the company it is the company’s policy to comply with applicable laws and cooperate when regulatory bodies make requests 

  

the company is subject to various federal state and local environmental and environmentallyrelated laws and regulations these laws and regulations which are constantly changing can require expenditures for remediation and may in certain instances result in assessment of fines the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures the estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued however certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets when recoverable through regulated rates ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material management believes that any such required expenditures will not be significantly different in either their nature or amount in the future and does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations the company has identified situations that require remedial action for which approximately 28 million is included in other longterm liabilities at december 31 2004 

  

at the end of the useful life of a well the company is required to remediate the site by plugging and abandoning the well costs associated with this obligation totaled 07 million 13 million and 07 million during the years ended 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

in the second quarter of 2004 the company established a liability for a guarantee in the amount of 58 million in support of a 50 owned nonrecourse financed energy project in panama the guarantee covers a project loan debt service reserve requirement the guarantee was included as part of the entire impairment charge of 396 million which has been included as international investments primarily impairment on the statements of consolidated income for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

audit committee 

  

the audit committee composed entirely of independent directors meets periodically with equitable’s independent auditors and management to review the company’s financial statements and the results of audit activities the audit committee in turn reports to the board of directors on the results of its review and selects the independent auditors 

  

  

transactions with directors’ affiliated companies 

  

in the course of ordinary business the company may have engaged in transactions with companies and organizations for which an equitable resources director serves as an officer those directors did not have a material interest in any such transactions and none of those transactions exceeded 5 of the gross revenues of either equitable resources or the other organization moreover any such transactions were entered into on armslength terms believed to be fair 

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates   the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon equitable’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable the company applies sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” statement no 144 in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a “critical accounting estimate” as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about cash flows over future years these assumptions affect the amount of an impairment which would have an impact on the income statement management’s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to do so in the future 

  

additionally the company holds several investments in nonconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method accounting principles board no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” apb no 18 requires a company to recognize a loss in the value of an equity method investment which is other than a temporary decline the company analyzes its equity method investments based on its share of estimated future cash flows from the investment to determine whether the carrying amount will be recoverable this is a “critical accounting estimate” for reasons similar to those described above regarding assumptions about future cash flows 

  

during the second quarter of 2004 several negative circumstances caused the company to evaluate its international investments for additional impairments and to accelerate its plans to exit the international generation business see “equity in nonconsolidated investments” in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment analysis performed in the second quarter of 2004 

  

goodwill beginning in fiscal year 2002 goodwill was required to be evaluated annually for impairment in accordance with statement no 142 this statement requires that a twostep process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired step one is to test for potential impairment which requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value if the fair value is higher than the book value no impairment occurs if the fair value is lower than the book value step two must be performed step two requires measurement of the amount of impairment loss if any and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill the resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment must be recorded 

  

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill impairment is a “critical accounting estimate” because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and these changes could cause a material impact to the income statement management’s assumptions about discount rates inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions such as expected growth rate require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and anticipated future revenues additionally statement no 142 requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 

  

as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements goodwill recorded was analyzed for impairment with the implementation of statement no 142 in 2002 the fair value of the company’s goodwill all of which related to noresco was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information based on the analysis the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value recorded for the goodwill therefore the company recognized an impairment during the first quarter of 2002 the implied fair value of the goodwill using the discounted cash flows methodology was 517 million the carrying value of the goodwill was 572 million resulting in an after tax impairment charge of 55 million in the fourth quarters of 2004 2003 and 2002 the company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts   the company’s utility division equitable gas company encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable as such equitable gas company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision equitable gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable “writeoffs” as a percentage of total revenue this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis for 2004 the monthly provision was established at 4 of residential sales periodically the reserve is reviewed for reasonableness the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather both of these items ultimately impact the customers’ ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the pass through of purchased gas costs to the customers 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a “critical accounting estimate” because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the changes in the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital the actual weather commodity prices and other internal and external economic conditions such as the mix of the customer base between residential commercial and industrial may vary significantly from management’s assumptions and may impact expected operating income the regulatory environment allows certain customers to enter into longterm payment arrangements the ultimate collectibility of which is difficult to determine additionally management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time 

  

performance plan the company accounts for stockbased compensation awards under apb no 25 the company treats its 2003 executive performance incentive program 2003 plan under which grants were awarded in 2003 as a variable plan 

  

the actual cost to be recorded for the plan is not known until the measurement date which is in december 2005 for the 2003 plan requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized the number of shares to be awarded in the plan is dependent upon attainment of certain total shareholder return performance goals relative to the performance of a peer group in the current period the company estimated that the performance measures would be met at 167 of the full value of the shares for the 2003 plan and that the estimated end of 2005 share price would be 6250 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the performance plan is a “critical accounting estimate” because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the shares and the performance of the peer group additionally the impact on the statement of consolidated income of these changes could be material management’s assumptions about future stock price and the amount of the payment to ultimately be made requires significant judgment due to the volatility of the stock market 

  

pension plans   the calculation of the company’s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plan pension plan requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be “critical accounting estimates” changes in these

  

  

assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts and actual experience can differ from these assumptions the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 

  

the expected longterm rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability the company establishes the expected longterm rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time including the pension plan’s investment mix and the historical and forecasted rates of return on these types of securities the pension plan’s investment mix as of january 1 2004 and 2005 approximated 60 equity securities and 40 fixed income securities any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” statement no 87 although the longterm rate is intended to be fairly consistent the company has reevaluated and reduced the rate at the beginning of both 2003 and 2004 the expected longterm rate of return determined by the company was 825 at both january 1 2004 and 2005 pension expense increases as the expected longterm rate of return decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return by 05 from 825 to 775 as of january 1 2005 would increase the company’s projected net periodic pension expense by approximately 06 million 

  

the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled in estimating that rate statement no 87 requires and the company looks to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of 600 and 625 as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the company’s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 05 from 600 to 550 would increase the company’s projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2004 by approximately 43 million additionally had the company’s discount rate decreased to 550 as of december 31 2004 the company’s net periodic pension expense for 2005 would be projected to increase by approximately 02 million as a significant portion of the pension plan’s participants are retirees 

  

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” statement no 109 statement no 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse please read note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a “critical accounting estimate” because the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements requires the company to estimate the income tax expense in each jurisdiction in which the company operates this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities and reserves together with assessing the tax effect of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as intangible drilling costs other comprehensive income and depreciation of other fixed assets for tax and accounting purposes these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 

  

the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that it is believed to be more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance must be established the company considers all available evidence both positive and negative to determine whether based on the weight of the evidence a valuation allowance is needed evidence used includes information about the company’s current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as all currently available information about future years including the company’s anticipated future performance the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the statements of consolidated income significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 

  

the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from alternative minimum tax credits deferred revenues and expenses and state net operating loss carryforwards the company has established a 

  

  

valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards as it is believed that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not all be realized no other valuation allowances have been established as it is believed that future sources of taxable income reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these assets any change in the valuation allowance would impact the company’s income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas which can affect the operating results of equitable through the equitable supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the equitable utilities segment the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses simple nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company also enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit the exposure to shifts in market prices the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

for commodity price derivatives used to hedge forecasted company production equitable sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk these financial instruments include forward contracts swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements the level of price exposure is limited by the value at risk limits allowed by this policy management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted in general equitable’s strategy is to become more highly hedged for production over the next several years at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels the company believes that prices between 300 and 350 per mcf are sustainable in the longterm above this range nontraditional supplies become economically feasible furthermore the company expects price volatility to result in prices significantly higher and lower than this range the company attempts to take advantage of these price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when prices are much higher than the range and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below the range however the company has typically not hedged material volumes unless the natural gas prices exceed 400 per mcf the goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility 

  

for commodity price derivatives held for trading purposes the marketing group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits these financial instruments include forward contracts swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements 

  

with respect to the energy derivatives held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2004 the company continued to execute its hedging strategy by utilizing price swaps of approximately 3149 bcf of natural gas these derivatives have hedged varying levels of expected equity production through 2011 a decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2004 levels would increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately 1858 million an increase of 10 in the market price of natural gas would decrease the fair market value by the same amount 

  

with respect to derivative contracts held by the company for trading purposes as of december 31 2004 a decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2004 level would decrease the fair market value by approximately 01 million an increase of 10 in market price of natural gas from the december 31 2004 level would increase the fair market value the same amount 

  

the company determined the change in the fair value of the natural gas instruments using a method similar to its normal change in fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2004 the price change was then applied to the natural gas instruments recorded on the company’s balance sheet resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the energy derivatives held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with 

  

  

commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term the energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and as applicable anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

the disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions if the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the energy derivatives a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

in the third quarter of 2004 the company entered into three variable share forward contracts to hedge cash flow exposure associated with the forecasted future disposal of kerrmcgee shares the variable share forward contracts which contain collars meet the requirements of sfas no 133 implementation issue g20 “assessing and measuring the effectiveness of an option used in a cash flow hedge” and have been designated as cash flow hedges under this guidance complete hedging effectiveness is assumed and the entire fair value of the collar is recorded in other comprehensive income these variable share forward contracts provide tax efficient monetization alternatives for the now limited downside in the underlying kerrmcgee shares while continuing to maintain considerable exposure to potential upside in the value of kerrmcgee the three tranches of contracts represent the hedging of 60 million of the kerrmcgee shares received as merger consideration and were allocated among three different counterparties in a bidding process designed to maximize the pricing of the collars while providing an opportunity to minimize any counterparty credit exposure the remaining unhedged kerrmcgee shares owned by the company and not committed to the foundation after entering into these contracts is approximately 10 million shares the company is currently evaluating whether it can utilize the value of the unhedged shares effectively in a similar variable forward contract structure or whether a sale or other course of action would constitute the best use of this asset 

  

the company has variable rate shortterm debt as such there is some limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the company under its current capital structure the company maintains fixed rate longterm debt that is not subject to fluctuating interest rates 

  

the company may enter into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to future changes in interest rates but as of december 31 2004 the company had no such instruments outstanding 

  

the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts this credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value nymex traded futures contracts have minimal credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties the company manages the credit risk of the other derivative contracts by limiting dealings to those counterparties who meet the company’s criteria for credit and liquidity strength

part iv 

  




 item 1    business 

  

equitable resources inc equitable resources or equitable or the company is an integrated energy company with an emphasis on appalachian area natural gas supply activities including production and gathering natural gas distribution and transmission and energy efficiency solutions nationally but primarily in the eastern and western coastal regions of the united states the company and its subsidiaries offer energy natural gas and a limited amount of crude oil and natural gas liquids products and services to wholesale and retail customers through three business segments equitable utilities equitable supply and noresco the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1400 employees at the end of 2003 

  

the company was formed under the laws of pennsylvania by the consolidation and merger in 1925 of two constituent companies the older of which was organized in 1888 in 1984 the corporate name was changed to equitable resources inc 

  

the company makes certain filings with the securities and exchange commission sec including its annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments and exhibits to those reports available free of charge through its website wwweqtcom as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the sec the filings are also available through the sec at the sec’s public reference room at 450 fifth street nw washington dc 20549 or by calling 1800sec0330 also these filings are available on the internet at wwwsecgov the company’s annual report to shareholders press releases and recent analyst presentations are also available on its website 

  

equitable utilities 

  

equitable utilities contains both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated group consists of the distribution and interstate pipeline operations while the nonregulated group is involved in the nonjurisdictional marketing of natural gas risk management activities for equitable utilities and equitable supply and the sale of energyrelated products and services equitable utilities generated approximately 40 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2003 

  

natural gas distribution 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution operations are carried out by equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory for equitable gas includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales also referred to as “farm tap” service as the customer is served directly from a well or gathering pipeline in eastern kentucky the distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 274500 customers comprising 255500 residential customers and 19000 commercial and industrial customers 

  

equitable gas’ natural gas supply portfolio includes shortterm purchases purchases to be delivered in one month or less mediumterm purchases purchases to be delivered in less than one year but more than one month and longterm purchases purchases to be delivered in more than one year these natural gas supply contracts are obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the southwest united states purchases from local producers in the appalachian area and purchases from gas marketers equitable gas’ supply purchases include various pricing mechanisms ranging from fixed prices to several different index related prices these supply purchase contracts qualify as “normal purchases and normal sales” of natural gas 

  

because most of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 70 of calendar year 2003 revenues occurring during the winter heating season january–march november–december significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during offpeak season to accommodate higher customer demand during the winter heating season 

  

 

interstate pipeline 

  

the interstate pipeline operations of equitable utilities include the natural gas transmission storage and gathering activities of equitrans lp equitrans and carnegie interstate pipeline company carnegie pipeline the interstate pipeline division offers gas transportation storage gathering and related services to its affiliates and others in the northeastern united states including but not limited to dominion resources inc public service electric and gas company keyspan corporation nisource inc peco energy and amerada hess corporation in 2003 approximately 67 of transportation volumes and approximately 78 of revenues are from affiliates 

  

in the second quarter 2002 equitrans filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to merge its assets and operations with the assets and operations of carnegie pipeline in order to create operating efficiencies in july 2003 equitrans received an order from the ferc approving the merger of equitrans and carnegie pipeline on january 1 2004 the merger of equitrans and carnegie pipeline was effectuated with equitrans surviving the merger 

  

the present regulatory environment is designed to increase competition in the natural gas industry this environment has created a number of opportunities for pipeline companies to expand services and serve new markets the company has taken advantage of selected market opportunities by concentrating on equitrans’ underground storage facilities and the location of its pipeline system which allows interconnects with five major interstate pipelines – texas eastern transmission columbia gas transmission national fuel gas supply tennessee gas pipeline and dominion transmission the storage facilities and pipeline system are located adjacent to natural gas markets in the northeastern united states these interconnecting pipelines provide ample opportunities for equitrans to access natural gas markets in the northeastern united states the company believes that servicing local distribution companies in the northeast to meet their load demands for the winter months presents growth opportunities 

  

energy marketing 

  

equitable utilities’ unregulated marketing operations equitable energy llc equitable energy purchases stores and sells natural gas at both the retail and wholesale level primarily in the appalachian and midatlantic regions services and products offered by the marketing operations include commodity procurement and delivery physical natural gas management operations and control and customer support services to the company’s natural gas customers energy marketing manages equitable gas’ supply needs as permitted by the performancebased rate incentives described below 

  

the company also engages in trading and risk management activities with the objective of limiting exposure to shifts in market prices and optimizing the use of assets described above equitable energy uses prudent asset management to hedge projected production to optimize storage capacity assets through trading activities and to perform outsourced risk management services for large industrial customers 

  

the company continues to reduce its trading activities which are limited to trading derivative commodity instruments the company’s trading activity as of december 31 2003 had a marktomarket value of approximately 02 million this amount is insignificant relative to the consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows of the company 

  

rates and regulation 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution rates terms of service contracts with affiliates and issuance of securities are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pennsylvania public utility commission pa puc the distribution rates terms of service and contracts with affiliates are also subject to comprehensive regulation by the public service commission of west virginia and the distribution rates are subject to regulation by the kentucky public service commission pipeline safety is generally regulated by the rules of the federal department of transportation andor by the state regulatory commission the occupational safety and health administration osha also imposes certain additional safety regulations on the operations of equitable utilities 

  

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas the interstate transportation and the sale for resale of natural gas including transportation rates storage tariffs and various other 

  

 

matters are subject to federal regulation primarily by the ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation the ferc’s regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas some of the trading activities of the energy marketing operations are subject to regulation by among others the commodity futures trading commission cftc the ferc and the pa puc 

  

the pipeline operations of equitrans and carnegie pipeline are subject to rate regulation by the ferc in 1997 equitrans filed a general rate change application rate case the rate case was resolved through a ferc approved settlement among all parties the settlement provided with certain limited exceptions that equitrans not file a general rate increase with an effective date before august 1 2001 and must file a general rate case application to take effect no later than august 1 2003 in the second quarter 2002 equitrans filed with the ferc to merge its assets and operations with the assets and operations of carnegie pipeline in april 2003 equitrans filed a proposed settlement with the ferc related to the application to merge its assets with the assets of carnegie pipeline the settlement also provided for a deferral to april 2005 of the august 1 2003 rate case filing requirement this proposed settlement was broadly supported by most parties on july 1 2003 equitrans received an order from the ferc approving the merger of equitrans and carnegie pipeline but denying the request for deferral of the requirement to file a rate case by august 1 2003   in response to the july 1 2003 order equitrans filed for and received an extension of time for its rate case filing deadline from august 1 2003 until december 1 2003 also in response to the july 1 2003 order on january 1 2004 the merger of equitrans and carnegie pipeline was effectuated with equitrans surviving the merger 

  

equitrans timely filed its rate case application on december 1 2003 on december 31 2003 in accordance with the natural gas act the ferc issued an order accepting in part and rejecting in part equitrans’ general rate application certain of equitrans’ proposed tariff sheets have been accepted subject to a 5month suspension period but equitrans’ requests for revenue relief were denied the increase was rejected in large part because equitrans did not provide cost and revenue data for carnegie pipeline equitrans is planning to assemble cost and revenue data for carnegie pipeline and refile its rate case application in the first quarter of 2004 consistent with the company’s original december 1 2003 filing equitrans’ upcoming rate case application will address several issues including establishing an appropriate return on the company’s capital investments addressing the company’s pension funding levels accruing for postretirement benefits other than pensions and restructuring its storage services the company’s request for rate relief is expected to be approximately 180 million in conjunction with the company’s application for rate relief equitrans filed a rehearing request on january 30 2004 seeking reconsideration of the ferc’s december 31 2003 order equitrans will continue to explore and evaluate settlement options throughout the pendency of the case 

  

for additional discussion of regulatory matters involving equitable utilities see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda and note 11 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

competitive environment 

  

over the last three years equitable gas has been working with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performancebased rate making in 2001 equitable gas received approval from the pa puc to implement a performancebased incentive that provides to customers a purchased gas cost credit which is fixed in amount while enabling equitable gas to retain all revenues in excess of the credit through more effective management of upstream interstate pipeline capacity during the third quarter 2002 the pa puc approved a oneyear extension of this program through september 2004 in that same order the pa puc approved a second performancebased initiative related to balancing services this initiative runs through 2005 during the second quarter of 2003 equitable gas reached a settlement with all parties to extend its performancebased purchased gas cost credit incentive through september 2005 the settlement also included a new performancebased incentive which allows equitable to retain 25 of any revenue generated from a new service designed to increase the recovery of capacity costs from transportation customers a pa puc order approving the settlement was issued in september 2003 

  

in the third quarter 2002 the pa puc issued an order approving equitable gas’ request for a delinquency reduction opportunity program the program gives incentives to eligible customers to make payments exceeding their current bill amount and to receive additional credits from equitable gas to reduce the customer’s delinquent balance the program will be fully funded through customer contributions and a surcharge in rates 

  

 

in the second quarter 2002 the pa puc authorized equitable gas to offer a sales service that would give residential and small business customers the alternative to fix the unit cost of the commodity portion of their rate the program was developed in response to customer requests for a method to reduce the fluctuation in gas costs this “first of its kind” program in pennsylvania is another in a series of serviceenhancing initiatives implemented by equitable gas a competitor dominion retail inc appealed the pa puc order authorizing the new service to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania in september 2003 the commonwealth court of pennsylvania issued an order affirming the pa puc decision granting equitable gas authority to implement the new fixed sales service to date equitable gas has not offered fixed sales service but will continue to analyze the feasibility of a fixed sales service in the future 

  

equitrans will be experiencing significant competitive challenges influenced by the ultimate resolution of the rate case over the next few years as 22 of the pipeline’s firm contracts expire in calendar year 2004 and another 73 expire in 2005 despite these challenges equitrans believes that servicing local distribution companies in the northeastern united states presents growth opportunities 

  

the large industrial market is extremely competitive resulting in very low realized margins despite the continued national economic downturn experienced during 2002 the industrial activity and volumes increased in 2002 compared to 2001 however the activity and volumes decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to high gas prices fluctuations in industrial demand do not have a significant impact on the company’s financial results 

  

equitable supply 

  

prior to 2002 equitable supply was referred to as equitable production in 2002 the company changed the name of the segment to equitable supply because the segment consists of two activities production and gathering this change does not impact the yeartoyear comparability of the business segment 

  

equitable’s production business develops produces and sells natural gas and to a limited extent crude oil and its associated byproducts with operations in the appalachian region of the united states its natural gas gathering business engages in gathering the company’s and third party gas and in the limited processing and sale of natural gas liquids equitable supply generated approximately 54 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2003 

  

production 

  

equitable’s production business operating through equitable production company and several smaller affiliates referred to collectively as “equitable production” is the largest owner of proved natural gas reserves in the appalachian basin the oldest and geographically one of the largest natural gas producing regions in the united states equitable production currently operates approximately 12000 producing wells in the appalachian basin as of december 31 2003 the company estimated its total proved reserves to be 2067 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe including proved undeveloped reserves of 484 bcfe 

  

the company’s reserves are located entirely in the appalachian basin the appalachian basin is characterized by wells with comparatively low rates of annual decline in production wells generally produce for periods longer than 50 years low production costs per well and high british thermal unit btu or energy content for operational and commercial reasons some of the gas produced is processed to allow heavier hydrocarbon propane butane and ethane streams to be stripped and sold separately within certain limits the company can vary the amount of the hydrocarbons extracted this can cause the conversion rate between energy content measured in btu to volumes measured in million cubic feet equivalent mmcfe to vary once drilled and completed wells in the appalachian basin typically have low ongoing operating and maintenance requirements and require minimal capital expenditures these rates of production are low in comparison to other geographic locations in the united states many of the company’s wells in these areas have been producing for decades and in some cases since the early 1900’s reserve estimates for properties with long production histories are generally more reliable than estimates for properties with shorter production histories 

  

virtually all of the company’s wells are low risk development wells drilled to relatively shallow depths ranging from 1000 to 7000 feet below the surface many of these wells are completed in more than one producing formation including coal formations in certain areas and production from these formations may be mixed or commingled commingled production lowers producing costs on a per unit basis compared to isolated zone completions 

  

 

in the appalachian basin during 2003 equitable production drilled 401 gross wells at a success rate of 100 this drilling was concentrated within the core areas of southwest virginia southern west virginia and southeast kentucky this activity resulted in 278 million cubic feet mmcf per day of gas sales and proved developed reserve additions of 120 bcfe the 120 bcfe of proved developed reserve additions include approximately 32 billion cubic feet bcf of proved developed extensions discoveries and other additions that were not previously classified as undeveloped the remaining 88 bcfe relate to proved undeveloped reserves that were transferred to proved developed reserves 

  

equitable production currently has an inventory of 36 million gross acres of which approximately 73 is considered undeveloped as of december 31 2003 the company estimated the proved undeveloped reserves of the underlying leases and fee interests to be 484 bcfe from approximately 1616 proved undeveloped drilling locations in the last three years equitable production has completed substantially all of the wells it has drilled additionally given the fact that the company has developed proved undeveloped reserves of 88 bcfe and 85 bcfe during 2003 and 2002 respectively and that the company’s plans include developing similar levels of proved undeveloped reserves going forward the company believes that the 484 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves will be developed in a reasonable period of time currently estimated to be five years 

  

gathering 

  

equitable gathering is comprised of kentucky west virginia gas company llc equitable field services llc equitable gathering llc and the gathering operations of equitable production referred to collectively as “equitable gathering” equitable gathering derives its revenues from the largest gas gathering and production pipeline system in the appalachian basin the system includes approximately 10000 miles of pipeline located throughout west virginia eastern kentucky southwestern virginia eastern ohio and portions of pennsylvania over 80 of the volumes through the pipeline system interconnect with three major interstate pipelines columbia gas transmission east tennessee natural gas company and dominion transmission the system also maintains interconnects with equitrans the company’s interstate transmission affiliate that affords access to the pittsburgh market area for gathered gas maintaining these interconnects provides the company with access to multiple markets and the flexibility to redirect deliveries when flow interruptions occur flow management through these connections also allows the company to optimize operating conditions for these gathering assets 

  

gathered sales volumes for 2003 totaled 1267 bcf of which approximately 47 related to affiliate sales volumes primarily the gathering of equitable production’s equity sales volumes 36 related to third party volumes and the remainder related to volumes in which interests were sold by the company but which the company still operates for a fee approximately 69 of the company’s 2003 gathering revenues were from affiliates the company is currently charging below market rates to certain of its third party gathering customers and is continuing to make efforts to raise those rates to market 

  

in july 2001 equitrans filed an application with the ferc to transfer all of its natural gas pipeline gathering systems located in west virginia and pennsylvania to equitable gathering on february 14 2002 the ferc approved the application resulting in the transfer of gathering systems the transfer was effective january 1 2002 for segment reporting purposes the systems transferred consisted of approximately 1200 miles of low pressure small diameter pipeline and related facilities used to gather gas from wells in the region total system throughput is approximately 131 bcf annually generating annual revenues of approximately 40 million the effect of this transfer was not material to the results of operations or financial position of the equitable utilities or equitable supply segments therefore segment results have not been restated for this transfer 

  

prepaid natural gas sales 

  

in december 2000 the company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales contracts for a total of approximately 527 mmcf of reserves the company is required to deliver certain fixed quantities of natural gas during the term of the contracts the first contract was for five years with net proceeds of 1040 million and has two years remaining the second contract was for three years with net proceeds of 1048 million and was completed at the end of 2003 these contracts were recorded as prepaid forward sales and are recognized in income as deliveries occur 

  

 

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

in december 2001 the company sold its oildominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities the sale resulted in a decrease of 63 bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately 60 million the field produced approximately 4 bcfe annually although the company no longer operates these properties it continues to gather and market the natural gas produced for a fee during 2003 and 2002 these fees were approximately 17 million and 15 million respectively 

  

in february 2003 the company sold approximately 500 of its lowproducing wells within two of its nonstrategic districts in two separate transactions the sales resulted in a decrease of approximately 13 bcf of net reserves for proceeds of approximately 66 million the wells produced approximately 10 bcf in 2002 the company did not recognize a gain or a loss as a result of this disposition 

  

in february 2003 the company purchased the remaining 31 limited partner interest in appalachian basin partners lp abp from the minority interest holders for 442 million the abp partnership was formed in november 1995 when the company monetized appalachian gas properties qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit the company retained a partnership interest in the gas properties that increased substantially based on the attainment of a performance target which was met near the end of 2001 the company consequently consolidated the partnership starting in 2002 and the remaining portion not owned by the company was recorded as minority interest the 31 limited partner interest purchased by the company represents approximately 602 bcf of reserves 

  

competitive environment 

  

equitable supply’s commercial operations are focused on selling a commodity at a high level of reliability of delivery equitable supply does not actively engage in any activities to differentiate its products in an extremely competitive market and therefore receives market based pricing equitable supply’s commercial operations are located in the appalachian basin because the appalachian basin is geographically located in the northeastern united states gas prices are generally higher than those prices for gas located in the gulf region of the country given the differences in supply and demand of natural gas in those areas this location provides equitable supply a price advantage over those companies located in the gulf region of the country 

  

the company has noticed some relative value erosion of midatlantic basis in recent months as a result of new base load gas supplies if the rate of supply growth exceeds the midatlantic region’s growth in demand there may be further weakening in basis especially in the summer months at this time this erosion has not had a significant impact on the company’s results 

  

the combination of its longlived production low drilling costs high drilling completion rates at shallow depths and proximity to natural gas markets has had a substantial impact on the development of the appalachian basin resulting in a highly fragmented operating environment in 2003 kentucky virginia and west virginia had approximately 4500 independent operators and approximately 100000 producing natural gas and oil wells also the historical availability of tax incentives has resulted in extensive drilling in the shallow formations with these low technical risk characteristics 

  

hedging activities 

  

equitable has historically entered into hedging contracts with respect to forecasted natural gas production and third party purchases and sales at specified prices for a specified period of time the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

 

noresco 

  

noresco provides an integrated group of energyrelated products and services that are designed to reduce its customers’ operating costs and improve their energy efficiency the segment’s activities are comprised of performance contracting energy efficiency programs combined heat and power and central boilerchiller plant development design construction ownership and operation noresco’s customers include governmental military institutional commercial and industrial endusers in 2003 approximately 41 of noresco’s operating revenues were from the federal government noresco also develops constructs and operates facilities in the united states and operates private power plants in selected international countries noresco provided approximately 6 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2003 

  

the segment’s performance contracting group provides a “turnkey” solution for clients to implement energy efficiency and conservation projects guaranteed energy savings are used to pay for installation of new energyefficient equipment and systems within the performance contracting solution noresco provides engineering analysis project management construction financing operations and maintenance and energy savings measurement and verification this is a growing market primarily in the public sector typically at any given time noresco has a range of 60 to 100 ongoing construction contracts depending on the size and mix of the projects and approximately 150 to 250 ongoing operations and maintenance projects 

  

the segment’s energy infrastructure group provides clients with development construction and operation and maintenance services for cogeneration central plant and private power generation facilities in the united states noresco also operates private power plants in selected international countries these projects serve a diverse clientele including governmental institutional commercial and industrial customers and utilities noresco’s capabilities offer a “turnkey” approach to energy infrastructure programs including project development equipment selection fuel procurement environmental permitting construction financing and operations and maintenance some of these projects are held through equity in nonconsolidated investments 

  

revenue backlog increased to 1342 million at yearend 2003 from 1182 million at the end of 2002 a substantial portion of the backlog is expected to be constructed within the next eighteen months 

  

competitive environment 

  

noresco operates in a highly competitive market segment with a significant number of competitors including affiliates of large energy companies that have entered this market in recent years noresco’s focus is on larger contracts in core performance contracting and energy infrastructure markets 

  

many energy infrastructure and performance contracting projects require that noresco provide a surety bond in advance of being awarded a contract noresco’s continued ability to obtain adequate bonding could affect noresco’s business 

  

on september 30 2003 the enabling legislation for the performance contracting work that noresco performs for the federal government under the department of energy contracts lapsed and is pending extension in congress until this issue is resolved the noresco segment’s ability to sign new contracts under the department of energy master agreements is affected however the department of defense has informed noresco that it is not interpreting the statutory lapse as prohibiting new awards under existing master agreements 

  

foreign operations 

  

the noresco segment has investments in nonconsolidated partnerships located in foreign countries specifically in jamaica panama and costa rica these investments represent equity ownership interests in independent power plant projects the projects were constructed and two currently operate as the result of specific needs of private or governmental entities to secure power that is more cost effective and reliable than existing sources of power these projects consist of energy production plants that have been financed using nonrecourse financing at the project level typically longterm power purchase agreements are signed with the customer in the host country whereby the customer agrees to purchase the energy generated by the plant once initial contracts expire the projects attempt to secure new power capacity contracts the economic environment and market price 

  

 

for power in these countries directly impacts new power capacity contracts and any power sold on the open market these market prices have adversely impacted our equity earnings in these projects 

  

the noresco projects are held through equity in nonconsolidated entities all earnings in these projects are reported through the statement of consolidated income as equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments see further information at note 9 to the consolidated financial statements noresco has not made any international investments since april 2001 and does not expect to make any international investments in 2004 noresco has a total cumulative investment in these two projects of 273 million as of december 31 2003 and noresco’s ownership share of the earnings for 2003 2002 and 2001 related to the total investments was 25 million 47 million and 76 million respectively the company is currently investigating all possible alternatives related to these international projects 

  

the company reviewed its equity investment related to petroelectrica de panama ldc an independent power plant project in panama during the fourth quarter of 2003 as the project was unsuccessful in securing power capacity contracts moreover the market prices for power supply in panama make it uneconomical to operate the plant as a result the plant was shut down during january 2004 the company is evaluating various options including the closing of the plant both temporarily and permanently and the sale of the plant as part of the impairment analysis the company performed a probability cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and compared this amount to the book value of the equity investment the probability cash flows resulted in a lower fair value than the carrying value and an impairment was deemed necessary an impairment of 111 million was recorded in 2003 and represents the full value of noresco’s equity investment in the project further noresco also had an investment in a power plant in jamaica which was impaired in 2002 and deconsolidated in 2003

 item 7    management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates   

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon equitable’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies relate to the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable the company applies sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” statement no 144 in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a “critical accounting estimate” as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about cash flows over future years these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment which would have an impact on the income statement management’s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to do so in the future 

  

the company reviewed its assets relating to a jamaican power plant project during the second quarter of 2002 as the project had not been operating at expected levels and repeated remediation efforts were unsuccessful additionally the future projections demonstrated that the losses associated with the assets were likely to continue the company determined through its analysis that an impairment existed as part of the impairment analysis the company performed a probability cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and compared this amount to the carrying value of the asset the probability cash flows resulted in a lower fair value than the carrying value and an impairment was deemed necessary an impairment of 53 million was recorded in 2002 

  

additionally the company holds several investments in nonconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method accounting principles board no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” apb no 18 requires a company to recognize a loss in the value of an equity method investment which is other than a temporary decline the company analyzes its equity method investments based on its share of estimated future cash flows from the investment to determine whether the carrying amount will be recoverable this is a “critical accounting estimate” for similar reasons as those above regarding assumptions about future cash flows 

  

the company reviewed its equity investment related to petroelectrica de panama ldc an independent power plant project in panama during the fourth quarter of 2003 as the project was unsuccessful in securing power capacity contracts moreover the market prices for power supply in panama make it uneconomical to operate the plant as a result the plant was shut down during january 2004 the company is evaluating various options including the closing of the plant both temporarily and permanently and the sale of the plant as part of the impairment analysis the company performed a probability cash flow analysis using the undiscounted future cash flows and compared this amount to the book value of the equity investment the probability cash flows resulted in a lower fair value than the carrying value and an impairment was deemed necessary an impairment of 111 million was recorded in 2003 and represents the full value of noresco’s equity investment in the project 

  

the company also reviewed its equity investment in igceri panam thermal generating limited igceri another independent power plant project in panama during the fourth quarter of 2003 based on the analysis performed the investment was not deemed to be impaired igceri will compete to sign new longterm power purchase agreements with customers in the second and third quarters of 2004 the outcome of these contracts will affect the future cash flows of igceri and could impact a future impairment analysis the company 

  

 

will reassess the impairment analysis in late 2004 should the outcome be significantly different than currently anticipated the book value of the company’s investment in igceri is 217 million at december 31 2003 

  

goodwill beginning in fiscal year 2002 goodwill was required to be evaluated annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” statement no 142 this statement requires a twostep process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired step one is to test for potential impairment which requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value if the fair value is higher than the book value no impairment occurs if the fair value is lower than the book value step two must be performed step two requires measurement of the amount of impairment loss if any and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill the resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill an impairment must be recorded

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill impairment is a “critical accounting estimate” because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and these changes could cause a material impact to the income statement management’s assumptions about discount rates inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions such as expected growth rate require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and anticipated future revenues additionally statement no 142 requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 

  

as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements goodwill recorded was analyzed for impairment with the implementation of statement no 142 in 2002 the fair value of the company’s goodwill all of which relates to noresco was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information based on the analysis the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value recorded for the goodwill therefore the company recognized an impairment during the first quarter of 2002 the implied fair value of the goodwill using the discounted cash flows methodology was 517 million the carrying value of the goodwill was 572 million resulting in an after tax impairment charge of 55 million in the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002 the company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required 

  

asset retirement obligations the company adopted sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” statement no 143 during fiscal year 2003 and its primary impact was to change the method of accruing for well plugging and abandonment costs statement no 143 requires that the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company will increase the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation depletion and amortization dda and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset retirement obligation is a “critical accounting estimate” because the underlying assumptions used for the value of the retirement obligation and related capitalized costs can change from period to period these assumptions include the estimated future retirement costs and the assumed creditadjusted risk free interest rate additionally the estimated depletion rates of the related assets determine the period over which the capitalized costs are charged to expense 

  

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company recorded an aftertax charge to earnings of 36 million as a cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 upon the adoption of statement no 143 and an asset retirement obligation at adoption of 287 million 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts the company’s utility division equitable gas encounters risks associated with the collection of its accounts receivable as such equitable gas records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision equitable gas primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivable “writeoffs” as a percentage of total revenue this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis for 2003 the monthly provision was established at 4 of residential sales periodically the reserve is reviewed for reasonableness the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices or a significant change in the weather both of these items ultimately impact the customers’

  

  

ability to pay and the rates that are charged to the customers due to the pass through of purchased gas costs to the customers 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a “critical accounting estimate” because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital the actual weather commodity prices and other internal and external economic conditions such as the mix of the customer base between residential commercial and industrial may vary significantly from management’s assumptions and may impact expected operating income additionally management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis using the assumptions that apply at that time 

  

due to the increase in gas commodity rates in 2003 and the colder than prior year weather customer bills increased from 2002 as a result of this increase equitable gas increased its allowance for doubtful accounts for the first quarter 2003 the provision recorded amounted to approximately 5 of residential revenues for 2003 

  

performance plan the company accounts for stockbased compensation awards under accounting principles board opinion no 25 apb no 25 the company treats its performance plans under which grants were awarded in 2003 and 2002 as variable plans

  

the actual cost to be recorded for the plans will not be known until the measurement date which is in december 2005 for the 2003 plan and december 2004 for the 2002 plan requiring the company to estimate the total expense to be recognized the number of shares to be awarded in each plan is dependent upon attainment of certain relative total shareholder return performance goals relative to the performance of a peer group in the current period the company estimated that the performance measures would be met at 130 of the full value of the shares for the 2003 plan and for 200 of the full value of the shares for the 2002 plan 

  

the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the performance plan is a “critical accounting estimate” because it is likely to change from period to period based on the market price of the shares the performance of the peer group and the level of performance by the employees involved additionally the impact on the statement of consolidated income of these changes could be material management’s assumptions about future stock price and the amount of stock to ultimately be awarded requires significant judgment due to the volatility of the stock market 

  

pension plans   the calculation of the company’s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plan pension plan requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be “critical accounting estimates” changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts and actual experience can differ from these assumptions the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate

  

the expected longterm rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plan to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability the company establishes the expected longterm rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time including the pension plan’s investment mix and the historical and forecasted rates of return on these types of securities the pension plan’s investment mix as of january 1 2003 and 2004 approximated 60 equity securities and 40 fixed income securities any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” statement no 87 although the longterm rate is intended to be fairly consistent the company has reevaluated and reduced the rate in both 2003 and 2004 the expected longterm rates of return determined by the company as of january 1 2003 and 2004 totaled 875 and 825 respectively pension expense increases as the expected longterm rate of return decreases therefore had the company assumed an expected longterm rate of return of 825 as of january 1 2003 the company’s pension expense for 2003 excluding the effect of any settlements paid during this period would have been approximately 05 million higher than the amount recorded 

  

the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled in estimating that rate statement no 87 requires and the company looks to rates of return on high quality fixed 

  

 

income investments the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of 625 and 700 as of december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the company’s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 05 from 625 to 575 would increase the company’s projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2003 by approximately 50 million additionally had the company’s discount rate decreased to 575 as of december 31 2003 the company’s net periodic pension expense for 2004 would be projected to increase by approximately 02 million as a significant portion of the pension plan’s participants are retirees 

  

variable interest entities on july 1 2003 the company adopted fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” fin no 46 fin no 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties the determination of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary requires an analysis of expected losses and expected residual returns by the variable interest entity this analysis must be made upon adoption and when certain triggering events occur

  

the company believes that the accounting estimates related to the calculations of expected losses and expected residual returns are “critical accounting estimates” because they require assumptions about cash flows over future years management’s assumptions about discount rates growth rates and other internal and external economic conditions require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and anticipated future results these assumptions impact whether the variable interest entity is consolidated which would have an impact on the financial statements 

  

the adoption of fin no 46 required the consolidation of plymouth cogeneration limited partnership plymouth a joint venture entered into by noresco and the deconsolidation of ealeri cogeneration partners lp jamaica which is the partnership that holds the jamaican power plant 

  

the consolidation of plymouth removed the equity investment in plymouth of 01 million and increases minority interest by 07 million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2003 the company consolidated 47 million in assets and 41 million in total liabilities including nonrecourse longterm debt of 40 million of which 02 million was current 

  

upon adoption of fin no 46 it was determined that jamaica was a variable interest entity and that the company was not the primary beneficiary as a result the company deconsolidated jamaica effective july 1 2003 the deconsolidation of jamaica removed 178 million of assets and 180 million of total liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet including nonrecourse project financing of 159 million all of which was current the company did not establish an equity method investment in jamaica upon deconsolidation as the amount of such investment would be less than zero and there is no recourse against the company beyond its investment in jamaica 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

equitable’s consolidated income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for 2003 was 1736 million or 274 per diluted share compared with 1506 million or 236 per diluted share for 2002 and 1518 million or 230 per diluted share for 2001 

  

the 2003 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change increased 15 from 2002 due to an increase in average natural gas prices gains on the sale of westport stock increased equity earnings in westport prior to the company’s change in accounting treatment for its investment in westport an increase in sales volumes from production less minority interest expense recognized in 2003 associated with the company’s ownership in abp and an impairment of the company’s jamaica power plant recognized in 2002 the improved 2003 earnings were partially offset by an impairment of an equity investment in an independent power plant project located in panama costs associated with the 2003 executive performance incentive program higher depreciation depletion and amortization expense resulting from an increase in production volumes and the unit depletion rate an increase in production and leasehold expenses primarily the result of an increase in severance taxes attributable to higher average natural gas prices and an increase in maintenance and other repairs an increase in interest expense primarily due to a net increase in the amount of outstanding debt an increase in benefit and insurance costs and the establishment of a community giving foundation 

  

 

the 2002 income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased 1 from 2001 due to the decreased equity earnings in nonconsolidated investments primarily related to the dilution of the company’s ownership percentage in westport as a result of stock offerings and mergers and acquisitions completed by westport during the year lower realized selling prices increased benefit costs and an impairment on the jamaica power plant project these factors were mostly offset by reduced expenses from 2001 initiatives and process improvements lower income tax expense increased drilling production enhancements cooler weather and increased commercial and industrial sales 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the company’s consolidated results based on operating income equity in earnings of nonconsolidated investments excluding westport and minority interest interest charges and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis headquarter costs are billed to the operating segments based upon a fixed allocation of the headquarters’ annual operating budget differences between budget and actual headquarters’ expenses are not allocated to the operating segments certain performancerelated incentive costs and administrative costs totaling 204 million 54 million and 80 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively were not allocated to business segments the increase in 2003 is primarily related to the 2003 executive performance incentive program more fully described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

equitable utilities 

  

equitable utilities’ operations comprise the sale and transportation of natural gas to customers at stateregulated rates interstate pipeline transportation and storage of natural gas subject to federal regulation the unregulated marketing of natural gas and limited trading activities 

  

natural gas distribution 

  

the local distribution operation of equitable gas provides natural gas services in southwestern pennsylvania and to municipalities and other customers in northern west virginia in addition equitable gas provides field line sales also referred to as “farm tap” service as the customer is served directly from a well or gathering pipeline in eastern kentucky equitable gas is subject to rate regulation by state regulatory commissions in pennsylvania west virginia and kentucky 

  

over the last three years equitable gas has been working with state regulators to shift the manner in which costs are recovered from traditional cost of service rate making to performancebased rate making performancebased rate making allows the customer and the company to share in the benefit derived from increased efficiency in 2001 equitable gas received approval from the pa puc to implement a performancebased incentive that provides customers a purchased gas cost credit which is fixed in amount while enabling equitable gas to retain all revenues in excess of the credit through more effective management of upstream interstate pipeline capacity during the third quarter 2002 the pa puc approved a oneyear extension of this program through september 2004 in that same order the pa puc approved a second performancebased initiative related to balancing services this initiative runs through 2005 during the second quarter of 2003 equitable gas reached a settlement with all parties to extend its performancebased purchased gas cost credit incentive through september 2005 the settlement also included a new performancebased incentive which allows equitable to retain 25 of any revenue generated from a new service designed to increase the recovery of capacity costs from transportation customers a pa puc order approving the settlement was issued in september 2003 

  

in the third quarter of 2002 the pa puc issued an order approving equitable gas’ request for a delinquency reduction opportunity program the program gives incentives to eligible delinquent customers to make payments exceeding their current bill amount and to receive additional credits from equitable gas to reduce the customer’s balance the program will be fully funded through customer contributions and a surcharge in rates 

  

in the second quarter 2002 the pa puc authorized equitable gas to offer a sales service that would give residential and small business customers the alternative to fix the unit cost of the commodity portion of their rate 

  

 

the program was developed in response to customer requests for a method to reduce the fluctuation in gas costs this “first of its kind” program in pennsylvania is another in a series of serviceenhancing initiatives implemented by equitable gas a competitor dominion retail inc appealed the pa puc order authorizing the new service to the commonwealth court of pennsylvania in september 2003 the commonwealth court of pennsylvania issued an order affirming the pa puc decision granting equitable gas authority to implement the new fixed sales service to date equitable gas has not offered fixed sales service but will continue to analyze the feasibility of a fixed sales service in the future 

  

equitable gas completes quarterly purchased gas cost filings with the pa puc that are subject to quarterly reviews and annual audits by the pa puc the pa puc completed its most recent audit in 2001 which approved the company’s purchased gas costs through 1999 the pa puc audit bureau has commenced an audit of the 20002001 purchased gas period the onsite audit concluded in the fourth quarter of 2003 a final audit report for the 20002001 period is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2004 the company’s purchased gas costs for 20002003 are currently unaudited by the pa puc but have received a final prudency review by the pa puc through 2002 in which no material issues have been noted 

  

interstate pipeline 

  

the interstate pipeline operations of equitrans and carnegie pipeline are subject to rate regulation by the ferc in 1997 equitrans filed a general change application rate case the rate case was resolved through a ferc approved settlement among all parties the settlement provided with certain limited exceptions that equitrans not file a general rate increase with an effective date before august 1 2001 and must file a general rate case application to take effect no later than august 1 2003 in the second quarter 2002 equitrans filed with the ferc to merge its assets and operations with the assets and operations of carnegie pipeline in april 2003 equitrans filed a proposed settlement with the ferc related to the application to merge its assets with the assets of carnegie pipeline the settlement also provided for a deferral to april 2005 of the august 1 2003 rate case filing requirement this proposed settlement was broadly supported by most parties on july 1 2003 equitrans received an order from the ferc approving the merger of equitrans and carnegie pipeline but denying the request for deferral of the requirement to file a rate case by august 1 2003 in response to the july 1 2003 order equitrans filed for and received an extension of time for its rate case filing deadline from august 1 2003 until december 1 2003 also in response to the july 1 2003 order on january 1 2004 the merger of equitrans and carnegie pipeline was effectuated with equitrans surviving the merger 

  

equitrans timely filed its rate case application on december 1 2003 on december 31 2003 in accordance with the natural gas act the ferc issued an order accepting in part and rejecting in part equitrans’ general rate application certain of equitrans’ proposed tariff sheets have been accepted subject to a 5month suspension period but equitrans’ requests for revenue relief were denied the increase was rejected in large part because equitrans did not provide cost and revenue data for carnegie pipeline equitrans is planning to assemble cost and revenue data for carnegie pipeline and refile its rate case application in the first quarter of 2004   consistent with the company’s original december 1 2003 filing equitrans’ upcoming rate case application will ad dress several issues including establishing an appropriate return on the company’s capital investments addressing the company’s pension funding levels accruing for postretirement benefits other than pensions and restructuring its storage services the company’s request for rate relief is expected to be approximately 180 million in conjunction with the company’s application for rate relief equitrans filed a rehearing request on january 30 2004 seeking reconsideration of the ferc’s december 31 2003 order equitrans will continue to explore and evaluate settlement options throughout the pendency of the case

  

energy marketing 

  

equitable utilities’ unregulated marketing operations equitable energy provides commodity procurement and delivery risk management and customer services to energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial and institutional endusers equitable energy’s primary focus is to provide products and services in those areas where the company has a strategic marketing advantage usually due to geographic coverage and ownership of physical or contractual assets 

  

the company also engages in limited trading activity with the objective of limiting exposure to shifts in market prices equitable energy uses prudent asset management to optimize the company’s assets through trading activities 

  

 

historically equitable utilities’ marketing affiliate purchased and resold a portion of equitable supply’s production beginning january 1 2003 these marketing activities have been recorded directly in equitable supply the change did not have a significant impact on the company as a whole however there was a significant reduction in the marketing revenues and purchased natural gas costs for the unregulated marketing activities recorded in equitable utilities 

  

capital expenditures 

  

equitable utilities forecasts 2004 capital expenditures to be approximately 58 million a 3 decrease over actual capital expenditures of approximately 60 million for 2003 the 2004 capital expenditures are expected to include 2003 capital commitments totaling 16 million the total 2004 capital budget includes 43 million for utilities infrastructure improvements 4 million for technology enhancements and 5 million for new business development the infrastructure improvements include improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines as well as storage enhancements the technology expenditures are primarily related to mobilization initiatives as well as systems enhancements and integration the new business capital is planned for distribution extension projects the company expects to finance its authorized 2004 expenditure program with cash generated from operations and with shortterm financing 

  

early in 2004 equitable gas successfully implemented a new customer information and billing system for which it incurred 118 million of capital expenditures from project inception through december 31 2003 total capital expenditures for this project significantly exceeded the original estimate though the project exceeded the original estimate no impairment has been recognized as the company believes that all costs related to the project are appropriate and will have future benefit to the company the system will be depreciated over a fifteen year period beginning in 2004

results of operations 

  

equitable utilities 

  

in 2002 the company classified all gains and losses associated with its energy trading activities to a net presentation for all periods presented in accordance with eitf no 023 

  

   

 

equitable utilities had operating income of 1099 million for 2003 compared with 1019 million for 2002 the increase is primarily attributable to colder weather in the first quarter of 2003 offset somewhat by warmer weather in the second and fourth quarters of 2003 additionally equitable marketing experienced an increase in wholesale volumes and margins in both the third and fourth quarters of 2003 these items were offset by an increase in provisions for doubtful accounts and a decrease in storage related revenues in the pipeline operations the distribution operations also experienced increased operating costs in the first quarter 2003 related to the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls incurred due to the cold weather 

  

capital expenditures decreased 98 million to 604 million in 2003 from 702 million in of 2002 the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in new business development spending and mainline replacement 

  

operating income for 2002 was 1019 million compared with 790 million for 2001 the improved results for 2002 are primarily due to higher revenues resulting from cooler weather in the fourth quarter 2002 nonrecurring 2001 charges related to pipeline operations workforce reductions and compressor station automation and an incremental credit related reserve of 70 million in 2001 

  

capital expenditures increased 317 million to 702 million in 2002 from 385 million in 2001 due to increased infrastructure improvement and technological enhancement projects 

  

distribution operations 

  

   

a   a heating degree day is computed by taking the average temperature on a given day in the operating region and subtracting it from 65 degrees fahrenheit each degree by which the average daily temperature falls below 65 degrees represents one heating degree day

  

b   om is defined for this calculation as the sum of operating expenses total operating expenses excluding depreciation less other taxes other taxes for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 totaled 24 million 30 million and 32 million respectively in 2003 2002 and 2001 there were approximately 274500 customers 275000 customers and 273000 customers respectively

  

 

   

net operating revenues for 2003 were 1652 million compared to 1561 million in 2002 heating degree days were 5695 in 2003 which is 8 cooler than the 5258 degree days in 2002 the colder weather had a positive yearoveryear impact on net operating revenues of approximately 63 million the additional increase in commercial and industrial net operating revenues of 17 million is primarily due to increased delivery margins during the first second and fourth quarters despite the 4 decrease in related volumes the related volumes decreased primarily due to low margin industrial usage and therefore had minimal impact on net operating revenues 

  

operating expenses increased by 59 million in 2003 from 761 million in 2002 the primary cause for the increase in expenses is due to an increase of 43 million in the provision for doubtful accounts which was recorded at approximately 5 of residential revenues combined with higher coldweather related maintenance costs from the first quarter 2003 for the repair of leaks and increased emergency calls these increases were offset by ongoing cost reduction initiatives 

  

net revenues for 2002 were 1561 million compared to 1546 million in 2001 heating degree days were 5258 for 2002 which is 4 cooler than the 5059 degree days recorded in 2001 and 12 warmer than the 30year normal of 5968 as of 2002 the colder weather had a positive yearoveryear impact on net revenues of approximately 22 million which was partially offset by a decrease in late fee revenue due to improved accounts receivable collections commercial and industrial volumes increased 22 from 2001 primarily due to the increased sales to steel industry customers despite the increase in commercial and industrial volumes net operating revenues did not proportionately increase due to the relatively low margins on industrial customer volumes 

  

operating expenses decreased 81 million in 2002 or 10 from 843 million in 2001 the decrease is attributable to a 70 million charge for incremental creditrelated reserves recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 the operating expenses were also favorably impacted by reduced operations and maintenance expenses related to continued process improvement initiatives and reduced collection related costs the reduced operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by increases in pension and post retirement benefit costs 

  

 

pipeline operations 

  

   

total transportation throughput increased 28 million mmbtu or 4 in 2003 over the prior year due primarily to colder than normal weather in the first quarter of 2003 that caused many of the firm transportation contract customers to use the full capacity of the pipeline those volumes were partially offset by decreased throughput due to warmer than prior year weather in the second and third quarters of 2003 because the margin from these firm transportation contracts is generally derived from fixed monthly fees regardless of the volumes transported the increased throughput did not positively impact net operating revenues 

  

net operating revenues from pipeline operations in 2003 decreased to 529 million from 567 million in 2002 the change in net operating revenues is due almost entirely to a decrease in storage related revenue as a result of firm customer delivery demands in the first quarter of 2003 from colder weather and higher gas prices in addition the high gas prices and lower demand in the second third and fourth quarters of 2003 resulted in the inability to take advantage of commercial opportunities that typically exist 

  

operating expenses decreased by 15 million to 232 million in 2003 the decrease is primarily due to planned maintenance charges related to a pipeline maintenance program recognized in the third quarter of 2002 combined with ongoing cost reduction initiatives 

  

net operating revenues from pipeline operations decreased to 567 million in 2002 from 621 million in 2001 the decrease is related to the transfer of all of its natural gas pipeline gathering systems to the equitable supply segment effective january 1 2002 the transfer resulted in a reduction of 36 million in net revenues and 31 million in operating costs the remainder of the decrease in net revenues is due to extraction revenues from the sale of the facilities and unfavorable transportation margins due to competition 

  

operating expenses decreased by 85 million in 2002 from 332 million in 2001 the decreased operating expenses are primarily due to the june 2001 and september 2001 charges for workforce reductions and process improvements related to compressor automation totaling 60 million the cost reductions from the 2001 charges and continued process improvement initiatives favorably impacted the 2002 expenses these cost savings were offset by the company’s decision to accelerate a pipeline maintenance program total operating expenses were also reduced by 31 million from the previously mentioned transfer of gathering systems 

  

 

energy marketing 

  

   

net operating revenues in 2003 increased to 270 million from 206 million in 2002 or 31 as a result of increased sales for resale off the equitable utilities’ systems increased unit marketing margins and the continued focus on high margin sales through storage optimization and asset management the equitable supply segment assumed the direct marketing of a substantial portion of its operating volumes at the beginning of 2003 which had previously been marketed by equitable marketing these volumes totaling approximately 138000 billion british thermal units bbtu in 2003 had been marketed by equitable marketing at very low margins although the assumption of these volumes by equitable supply did not have a significant impact on equitable marketing’s net operating revenues for the yearended december 31 2003 it was the primary reason for the significant increase in the unit marketing margins during that same period 

  

operating expenses decreased by 13 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the recovery of a bankrupt customer’s balance in 2003 that was reserved for in 2002 and a reduction in bad debt expense as well as continued cost reduction initiatives associated with the company’s decision to deemphasize low margin tradingoriented activities 

  

net revenues for energy marketing operations increased 66 million in 2002 or 47 from 140 million in 2001 this increase in net revenues and in unit marketing margins versus 2001 is a result of the company’s decision to focus on storage and asset management activities and continued deemphasis on the low margin trading oriented activities this decision resulted in the 21 reduction in marketed gas sales volumes in 2002 these increases were partially offset by losses of 26 million on transactions marked to market in 2001 

  

operating expenses decreased 527 from 2001 to 2002 the decline in operating expenses is associated with a reduction in workforce due to reduced trading activities in 2002 decreased provisions for bad debts attributable to lower gas prices compared to 2001 and reduced costs associated with retail marketing activities 

  

equitable supply 

  

equitable supply consists of two activities production and gathering with operations in the appalachian basin region of the united states equitable production develops produces and sells natural gas and minor amounts of associated crude oil and its associated byproducts equitable gathering engages in natural gas gathering and the processing and sale of natural gas liquids 

  

equitable supply completed several transactions which affect the comparability of the financial data between 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

prepaid natural gas sales 

  

during 2000 the company utilized two prepaid natural gas sales transactions to limit the company’s exposure to commodity volatility to reduce its counterparty risk and to raise capital these contracts are based upon energy content or btu the company converts these to their volumetric equivalents or mcfe using a factor of 105 mmbtu per mcfe 

  

 

in december 2000 equitable sold approximately 261 bcf of future production for proceeds of 1040 million this natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability under the terms of this sales contract the company must deliver approximately 14300 mcf per day for five years starting january 1 2001 the company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered 

  

in december 2000 equitable sold approximately 266 bcf of future production for proceeds of 1048 million this natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability under the terms of this sales contract the company was required to deliver approximately 24300 mcf per day for three years starting january 1 2001 and ending december 31 2003 the company recognized the revenue from this sale as natural gas was gathered and delivered 

  

the following table details the specifics of the company’s various prepaid transactions the gathering fee and wellhead price listed are for 2003 the gathering fee received for 2002 and 2001 relating to each transaction was 071 per mcf the wellhead price received for 2002 and 2001 was 328 per mcf and 323 per mcf for the five and three year contracts respectively 

  

   

sale of oil properties 

  

in december of 2001 the company sold its oildominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities the sale resulted in a decrease of 63 bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves and generated proceeds of approximately 60 million the field produced approximately 4 bcfe annually 

  

sales of gas properties 

  

occasionally the company enters into a sale of gas properties in order to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility to reduce counterparty risk to eliminate production risk and to raise capital while providing the company marketbased fees associated with the gathering marketing and operation of these producing properties 

  

in june 2000 equitable sold properties with 660 bcfe of reserves qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership eastern seven partners lp esp for proceeds of approximately 1222 million and a retained interest in the partnership this sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years the company retained an interest in the partnership that is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the consolidated balance sheet under the equity method of accounting under the terms of the transaction the company’s equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals the company separately negotiated armslength marketbased rates for gathering marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver the partnership’s natural gas to the market the underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term as the operator of the gas properties in the partnership the company may from time to time have receivables outstanding from esp of up to 10 million as of december 31 2003 and 2002 the company had receivables outstanding from esp totaling 01 million and 02 million respectively 

  

in december 2000 equitable sold properties with 1333 bcfe of reserves to a trust appalachian natural gas trust angt for proceeds of approximately 2558 million and a retained interest in the trust this sale of gas properties reduced the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years the company retained an interest in the trust which is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments on the consolidated balance sheet under the equity method of accounting under the terms of the transaction the company’s equity interest will increase under certain circumstances upon achieving certain production goals the company separately negotiated armslength marketbased rates for gathering marketing and operating fees with the trust in order to deliver the trust’s natural gas to the market the underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal as the operator of the gas properties and as a result of a separate agreement the company receives 

  

 

a marketbased fee for providing a restricted line of credit to the trust that is limited by the fair market value of the trust’s remaining reserves 

  

below is a table that details information associated with the company’s sales of gas properties in 2000 to esp and angt as of december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

in february 2003 the company sold approximately 500 of its lowproducing wells within two of its nonstrategic districts in two separate transactions the sales resulted in a decrease of approximately 13 bcf of net reserves for proceeds of approximately 66 million the wells produced an aggregate of approximately 10 bcf in 2002 the company did not recognize a gain or a loss as a result of this disposition 

  

appalachian basin partners lp 

  

in november 1995 the company monetized appalachian gas properties qualifying for the nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership appalachian basin partners lp abp the company recorded the proceeds as deferred revenue which was recognized as production occurred the company retained a partnership interest in the properties that increased substantially at the end of 2001 based on the attainment of a performance target beginning in 2002 the company no longer included abp volumes as monetized sales but instead as equity production sales as a result monetized sales volumes decreased by approximately 88 bcf from 2001 to 2002 while net equity sales volumes increased by the same amount the company consolidated the partnership starting in 2002 and the remaining portion not owned by the company was recorded as minority interest 

  

as a result of the company’s increased partnership interest in abp in 2002 the company began receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit attributable to abp this resulted in a reduction of the company’s effective tax rate during 2002 the nonconventional fuels tax credit expired at the end of 2002 and it is currently unclear whether legislation will be enacted to allow this tax benefit to exist in the future 

  

in february 2003 the company purchased the remaining 31 limited partnership interest in abp from the minority interest holders for 442 million the 31 limited partnership interest represented approximately 602 bcf of reserves as a result effective february 1 2003 the company no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with abp which totaled 09 million and 71 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively this transaction was approved by the company’s board of directors separate from equitable supply’s original 2003 capital budget program and was financed through shortterm financing 

  

capital expenditures 

  

equitable supply forecasts its 2004 capital expenditures to be approximately 138 million this includes 85 million for the development of appalachian holdings and 53 million for improvements and extensions to gathering system pipelines the 410 million decrease in the development of appalachian holdings from 2003 to 2004 is to allow equitable supply to concentrate on its core assets and insure a proper level of return related to all new projects the evaluation of new development locations market forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering system investments the company expects to finance its authorized 2004 expenditure program with cash generated from operations and with shortterm financing capital expenditures increased from 1475 million in 2002 to 2045 million in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in the level of development drilling in the appalachian holdings and the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in abp for 442 million the capital expenditures in 2003 and 2002 included 1260 million and 1144 million respectively for the development of appalachian holdings and 343 million and 331 million respectively for gathering system improvements and extensions 

  

 

other 

  

on october 15 2003 the company and the paper alliedindustrial chemical and energy workers industrial union local 5512 reached agreement on a new fiveyear contract the union workforce provides pipeline and compression services and contract well tending services to equitable supply in kentucky the terms of the contract mandated increased wages and pension benefits which will be offset in the company’s results of operations by decreases in overtime 

  

in 2004 equitable supply will focus on four main objectives to increase production and sales of natural gas these four objectives are 1 reducing bottom hole pressure in each well to the minimum level possible to eliminate impediments to natural gas flow 2 lowering field pressure to the minimum level that can be economically justified 3 reducing “lost” gas to the minimum level that can be justified economically and not accepting “unaccounted for” gas and 4 drilling the company’s remaining undeveloped acreage quickly and efficiently to deliver the company’s gas reserves to market

equitable supply’s average wellhead sales price realized on produced volumes for 2003 was 391 per mcfe compared to 347 per mcfe for 2002 the 044 per mcfe increase in the average wellhead sales price was attributable to higher gas commodity prices increased volumes at higher hedged prices and increased basis over the same period in 2002 the 5 increase in equity volumes was primarily the result of new wells drilled in 2002 and 2003 and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells and the company’s sale in february 2003 of approximately 500 of its lowproducing wells within two of its nonstrategic districts those wells produced an aggregate of approximately 10 bcf in 2002 the 10 increase in revenues from gathering fees was attributable to an 8 increase in the average gathering rate billed to equity and third party customers in addition to an increase in the segment’s equity and third party gathered volumes 

  

total operating expenses were 1366 million for 2003 compared to 1178 million for 2002 the 16 increase was primarily attributable to an increase in lease operating expenses severance taxes higher depreciation depletion and amortization expenses dda resulting from a 009 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate and increased production volumes and higher gathering and compression expenses mainly attributable to an increase in gathering fees paid to third parties the increase in severance taxes is primarily attributable to higher gas commodity prices the increase in lease operating expenses is primarily the result of an increase in road maintenance and other repair costs due to severe weather and flooding in 2003 and increases in property taxes and liability insurance premiums 

  

the decrease in minority interest expense of 62 million from 71 million in 2002 is due to the purchase of the remaining 31 limited partnership interest in abp from the minority interest holders in february 2003 beginning in 2002 the company consolidated abp with the portion not owned by the company being recorded as minority interest as a result of the company’s purchase of the remaining 31 limited partnership interest in abp effective february 1 2003 equitable supply no longer recognizes minority interest expense associated with abp 

  

equitable supply had operating income of 1712 million for 2002 compared with 1780 million in 2001 the lower results for 2002 are primarily due to a 025 per mcfe reduction in the average wellhead sales price partially offset by an increase in gathering revenues and a net reduction in operating expenses the net reduction in operating expenses is the result of a decrease in the severance tax component of production and leasehold expenses attributable to lower gas commodity prices reduced welltending expenses lower leasehold costs resulting from improved acreage management and lower gathering and compression expenses the total of which was partially offset by a 23 million increase in sga expenses 

  

sga costs remained consistent from 2002 to 2003 as a result of a reduction in legal claims and reserves being offset by a 20 million loss incurred during 2003 on the early termination of an uneconomic sales contract sga expenses for 2002 increased from the same period in 2001 due to 35 million of costs associated with legal claims and reserves partially offset by productivity improvements 

  

total sales volumes for 2003 have increased 26 bcfe compared to 2002 while total sales volumes have increased the amount of the increase has not met the company’s expectations primarily due to volume shortfalls in the southern west virginia region some of the shortfall versus the company’s expectations is related to well performance issues caused by wells drilled in 2002 in less productive areas of the region and negative impacts related to new automation technology and well surveillance the remaining shortfall is due to more pipeline system curtailments than were forecasted and delays in the timing of pressure optimization and production enhancement projects as a result the company has executed organizational changes that include assigning more engineers directly to operating districts to address production and performance issues through well surveillance initiatives and a reengineered predictive maintenance program in addition the company has taken actions in the form of adding more firm transportation on the interstate pipeline systems implementing new pipeline projects to increase the pipeline take away capacity and reliability and performing historical pipeline and measurement studies to help the company track and target future shortfalls on an accelerated basis the company has also shifted drilling capital to areas where overall results are more predictable and has reduced the overall level of capital in the 2004 capital budget related to the development of its appalachian holdings as compared to 2003 to allow equitable supply to concentrate on its core assets and ensure a proper level of return related to all new projects 

  

 

equitable production 

  

operational and financial data 

  

   

a   effective january 1 2003 the company adjusted its method for using a natural gas equivalents conversion factor to convert gallons of liquid hydrocarbon sales to equivalent volumes of natural gas sales this change results in an additional 03 bcfe natural gas sales volume and a corresponding reduction to reported company usage and line loss for the year ended december 31 2003

  

b   volumes sold associated with the company’s two prepaid natural gas sales contracts and the abp partnership discussed above

  

c   natural gas and oil production represents the company’s interest in gas and oil production measured at the wellhead it is equal to the sum of total sales volumes company usage line loss and natural gas inventory

  

d   includes volumes in which interests were sold but which the company still operates for thirdparties for a fee see the esp and angt table in the “sale of gas properties” section for additional information

  

 

   

equitable production’s total production revenues which are derived primarily from the sale of produced natural gas increased 369 million from 2002 to 2003 the increase is primarily the result of a 374 million increase in the total of net equity and monetized sales from 2002 due to a higher average wellhead sales price of 391 per mcfe compared to 347 per mcfe in the prior year 285 million and increased sales volumes 89 million the increase in sales volumes is the result of new wells drilled in 2002 and 2003 and production enhancements partially offset by the normal production decline in the company’s wells and the company’s sale in february 2003 of approximately 500 of its lowproducing wells within two of its nonstrategic districts in two separate transactions the wells sold produced an aggregate of approximately 10 bcf in 2002 the company did not recognize a gain or loss as a result of this disposition 

  

operating expenses increased 158 million or 21 over the prior year from 744 million to 902 million this increase was primarily due to increased dda costs 76 million higher severance taxes attributable to higher natural gas prices 53 million and increased lease operating expenses 33 million the increase in dda was due to a 009 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate 62 million and increased production volumes and other depreciation 14 million the 009 per mcfe increase in the unit depletion rate is comprised of a 003 per mcfe increase from 2002 drilling costs a 003 per mcfe increase due to the february 2003 acquisition of the abp limited partnership interest and a 003 per mcfe increase due to the january 1 2003 adoption of statement no 143 the increase in lease operating expenses is primarily the result of higher road maintenance due to severe weather and flooding in 2003 and other repair costs 15 million an increase in property taxes and liability insurance premiums 11 million and an increase in well maintenance and well surveillance costs 04 million 

  

total production revenues decreased 150 million from 2001 to 2002 the decrease in total production revenues is due primarily to lower effective commodity prices 153 million and sales of oil properties 170 million partially offset by increased production from new drilling 155 million and production enhancements 14 million 

  

operating expenses for the period ended december 31 2002 decreased 60 as compared to the same period in 2001 this decrease was primarily due to a 170 decrease in lease operating expense resulting from reduced welltending expenses and a 237 decrease in severance taxes which was primarily due to declines in the market commodity sales price land and leasehold maintenance costs were also lower as a result of lower delay rental costs due to improved acreage management 

  

 

equitable gathering 

  

operational and financial data 

  

   

a   revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect process and deliver natural gas from the field where it is produced to the trunk or main transmission line many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price in which case the company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components

  

   

equitable gathering’s total operating revenues increased 65 million or 103 from 633 million in 2002 to 698 million in 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to an 8 rise in the average gathering fee billed to equity and third party customers in addition to a 31 bcfe increase in gathered volumes resulting from higher equitable production volumes and new third party customers in southern west virginia 

  

total operating expenses increased to 464 million in 2003 from 434 million in 2002 a 7 increase year over year primarily due to higher third party gathering costs 15 million other gathering and compression increases 05 million and higher depreciation 05 million relating to capital expenditures for gathering system improvements and extensions 

  

equitable gathering revenues increased 27 from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a 157 increase in gathered volumes offset by a 121 decrease in the average gathering fee per mcfe the increase in gathered volumes is primarily due to the transfer of the equitrans gathering pipeline system from the equitable utilities segment the decrease in average gathering fees per mcfe is a result of a below market rate on the equitrans gathering pipeline system resulting from the ferc approved spin down 

  

total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased 38 from the same period in 2001 despite the 157 increase in gathered volumes this decrease was mainly attributable to a 61 decrease in gathering and compression costs primarily due to a reduction in third party gathering costs 

  

 

noresco 

  

noresco provides an integrated group of energyrelated products and services that are designed to reduce its customers’ operating costs and improve their energy efficiency the segment’s activities are comprised of performance contracting energy efficiency programs combined heat and power and central boilerchiller plant development design construction ownership and operation noresco’s customers include governmental military institutional commercial and industrial endusers noresco also develops constructs and operates facilities in the united states and operates private power plants in selected international countries 

  

   

   

revenues decreased to 1707 million in 2003 from 1901 million in 2002 a decrease of 194 million or 102 this decrease is due primarily to decreased construction activity of energy infrastructure projects versus the prior year gross profit margins increased to 240 in 2003 from 212 in 2002 reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year gross profit margin in 2002 included a demand side management program termination of 24 million gross profit margins trended upwards over the last year due to the focus on more profitable projects especially in the performance contracting contracts and away from less profitable energy infrastructure construction 

  

revenue backlog increased to 1342 million at yearend 2003 from 1182 million at yearend 2002 the increase in backlog was primarily due to the award of federal government contracts in 2003 

  

total operating expenses decreased by 64 million from 305 million in 2002 to 241 million in 2003 this decrease was primarily due to the 53 million impairment charge for the jamaica power plant project in 2002 as more fully discussed below additionally sga expenses decreased to 227 million in 2003 from 235 million in 2002 included in sga expenses in 2003 was 08 million related to the consolidation of the energy infrastructure and performance contracting groups and included in 2002 was 10 million related to office consolidations the remaining 06 million decrease in sga is primarily due to a reduction in labor costs 

  

equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of 25 million in 2003 and 47 million in 2002 reflects noresco’s share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets the decrease in earnings was 

  

 

primarily due to decreased earnings from the petroelectrica de panama ldc panamanian power plant because of the expiration of its power purchase agreement revenue in 2003 from a replacement agreement has been lower than that recognized in 2002 earnings were also lower due to the consolidation of hunterdon cogeneration lp hunterdon and plymouth cogeneration lp plymouth in the current year these consolidations as more fully described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements required noresco to recognize minority interest of 05 million in 2003 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company reviewed its equity investment in petroelectrica de panama ldc an independent power plant project in panama for impairment see “critical accounting policies involving significant estimates” for discussion of the analysis which resulted in an impairment charge for the full value of the investment of 111 million 

  

revenues increased to 1901 million in 2002 from 1574 million in 2001 an increase of 327 million or 208 this increase was due primarily to increased construction activity versus the prior year gross profit margins decreased to 212 in 2002 from 220 in 2001 reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year gross profit margins decreased due to competitive pressures and focus on larger projects with lower gross margins 

  

revenue backlog decreased to 1182 million at yearend 2002 from 1283 million at yearend 2001 the decrease in backlog was primarily attributable to delays in the awarding of government contracts 

  

total operating expenses increased to 305 million in 2002 from 291 million 2001 during the second quarter 2002 the company reviewed the jamaica power plant project related to the noresco operating segment for impairment as the project had not been operating to expected levels and repeated remediation efforts were unsuccessful the company owned 912 of the equity in the project and therefore consolidated the project in its financial statements for 2002 as a result of the company’s review an impairment loss of 53 million was recorded in 2002 to adjust the project assets to their fair value during the first quarter of 2003 the plant shut down its engines and terminated most of the staff in order to preserve available cash while discussions among the various parties involved in the project continued seeking a global settlement in april of 2003 eri jam llc owner of the company’s interest in the jamaica power plant project filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 in us bankruptcy court delaware in the third quarter 2003 eri jam llc transferred control under the partnership agreement to the other general partner upon adoption of fin no 46 it was determined that jamaica was a variable interest entity and that the company was not the primary beneficiary as a result the company deconsolidated jamaica effective july 1 2003 

  

partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses from the impairment charge depreciation depletion and amortization expense decreased from 2001 to 2002 by 43 million primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization of 37 million in accordance with statement no 142 sga expenses increased slightly to 235 million in 2002 from 231 million in 2001 included in sga expenses in both 2002 and 2001 were 10 million related to office consolidations 

  

equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of 47 million in 2002 and 76 million in 2001 reflects noresco’s share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets the decrease in earnings was primarily due to decreased earnings in a power plant in panama and another one in rhode island 

  

other income statement items 

  

   

in the first quarter of 2003 the company established a community giving foundation to facilitate the company’s charitable giving program for approximately 10 years the foundation was funded through a 

  

 

contribution of 905000 shares of westport resulting in a charge of 93 million to earnings with a onetime tax benefit of approximately 71 million see note 6 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

the company reported 36 million in equity earnings from its minority ownership in westport during the first quarter 2003 at the end of the first quarter of 2003 the company’s ownership position in westport decreased below 20 as a result of the decreased ownership the company changed the accounting treatment for its investment from the equity method to the available for sale method effective march 31 2003 

  

during the fourth quarter 2003 the company sold approximately 148 million shares of westport resulting in a capital gain of 140 million as of december 31 2003 the company owned 1153 million shares of westport 

  

interest expense 

  

   

interest expense increased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the issuance of 200 million of notes in november 2002 and the issuance of 200 million of notes in february 2003 the stated interest rate for both issuances is 515 the increase was partially offset by the redemption of 125 million of 735 trust preferred capital securities on april 23 2003 as well as lower interest rates on shortterm debt 

  

interest expense decreased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to the decrease in interest rates on shortterm debt this decrease was partially offset by the higher interest expense associated with the new longterm notes issued in november 2002 

  

average annual interest rates on the company’s shortterm debt were 12 18 and 41 for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

other items 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change 

  

effective january 1 2003 the company adopted statement no 143 which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized by the company at the time the obligation is incurred the adoption of statement no 143 by the company resulted in an aftertax charge to earnings of 36 million which is reflected as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the company’s statement of consolidated income for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

in accordance with the requirements of statement no 142 the company tested its goodwill for impairment as of january 1 2002 the company’s goodwill balance as of january 1 2002 totaled 572 million and was entirely related to the noresco segment the fair value of the company’s goodwill was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information as a result of the impairment test the company recognized an impairment of 55 million net of tax to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value as the level of future cash flows from the noresco segment were expected to be less than originally anticipated in accordance with statement no 142 this impairment adjustment was reported as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the company’s statement of consolidated income for the year ended december 31 2002 in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 the company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and no further impairment was required 

  

income from discontinued operations 

  

in april 1998 management adopted a formal plan to sell the company’s natural gas midstream operations a capital loss in connection with the sale was treated as a nondeductible item for tax reporting purposes under the then current treasury regulations embodying the “loss disallowance rule” resulting in additional tax recorded on this sale as a reduction to net income from discontinued operations in may 2002 the irs issued new treasury regulations 

  

 

interpreting the “loss disallowance rule” that permitted this capital loss to be treated as deductible during june 2002 the company filed amended 1998 tax return filings consequently in the second quarter 2002 the company recorded a 90 million increase in net income from discontinued operations related to this unexpected tax benefit the amended tax return filings are being reviewed during an ongoing regular examination by the irs of the company’s tax filings for the 1998 tax year 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

operating activities 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 1210 million in 2003 as compared to 2145 million in 2002 the 935 million decrease in operating cash flows from 2002 to 2003 is primarily the result of the decrease in cash provided from working capital due to a large increase in inventory during 2003 as compared to a slight decrease in inventory during 2002 the increase in inventory was mainly due to increased natural gas prices and volumes stored in the current year compared to prior year in addition the company made 518 million in pension contributions during 2003 

  

these decreases were partially offset by an increase in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change as adjusted to net cash provided by operating activities primarily due to the performance of the company’s operating segments as previously described current taxes were lower as a result of an increase in drilling and development costs for which deferred taxes were provided 

  

when the prepaid gas forward sale transactions were consummated the company reviewed the specific facts and circumstances related to these transactions to determine if the appropriate statement of cash flows presentation would be as an operating activity or a financing activity the company concluded that the appropriate accounting presentation of the prepaid gas forward sales transactions was as an operating cash flow item consistent with the company’s previous presentation the current presentation includes recognition of monetized production revenues related to prepaid forward gas sales in operating activities the amount for the both the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 is 557 million 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 2145 million in 2002 compared to 1299 million in 2001 the 846 million increase in operating cash flows from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of the company’s increased partnership interest in abp in 2002 in addition to a 369 million increase in cash flows from income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change excluding undistributed earnings from nonconsolidated investments minority interest and an impairment of longlived assets the combined change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues inventory and accounts payable did not significantly impact the net amount of cash provided by operating activities 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash flows used in investing activities totaled 2143 million in 2003 as compared to 1692 million in 2002 and 1258 million in 2001 

  

the company expended approximately 2657 million in 2003 for capital expenditures as compared to 2185 million in 2002 and 1327 million in 2001 equitable supply spent 2045 million in 2003 of which 1259 million was spent on developmental drilling 344 million was spent on infrastructure projects and 442 million was used for the purchase of the remaining limited partnership interest in abp in february 2003 the abp transaction was approved by the company’s board of directors separately from the capital expenditure program and was financed through shortterm financing equitable utilities spent 604 million in 2003 of which 424 million was spent on infrastructure projects 133 million was spent on technology projects 41 million was spent on business development and 06 million on other capital items 

  

also in 2003 there were several investing activities that provided cash the sale of approximately 148 million shares of westport stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 provided 384 million of proceeds in addition proceeds of 44 million were provided by the sale of the company’s 50 interest in an equity investment in october 2003 and proceeds of 66 were provided by the sale of wells in ohio in february 2003 these proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the funding of the company’s pension contribution during 2003 

  

 

cash used in 2002 investing activities included 176 million invested in availableforsale securities intended to fund plugging and abandonment and other liabilities for which the company selfinsures 

  

cash provided by investing activities in 2001 included 630 million of proceeds from the oildominated field sale within equitable supply these proceeds were held in a restricted cash account at december 31 2001 for use in a potential likekind exchange for certain identified assets during 2002 the restrictions lapsed and the cash was made available for operations 

  

a total of 221 million was authorized for the 2004 capital budget program as previously described in the business segment results the company expects to finance this program with cash generated from operations and with shortterm debt see discussion in the “shortterm borrowings” section below regarding the financing capacity of the company 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled 1129 million in 2003 as compared to 572 million of cash flows used in financing activities in 2002 and 265 million of cash flows used in financing activities in 2001 

  

the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities from 2002 to 2003 is primarily the result of increased borrowing in the current year shortterm borrowing activity resulted in a net cash inflow of 936 million in 2003 compared to a net cash outflow of 1694 million in the prior year in 2002 the 200 million longterm debt issuance in november 2002 was used to repay a significant portion of commercial paper and shortterm loans the increase in cash flows from shortterm borrowing activity was partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by longterm debt as compared to the prior year the company issued 200 million of notes in february 2003 with a stated interest rate of 515 and a maturity date of march 2018 the proceeds from this issuance were used to retire the company’s 125 million of 735 trust preferred securities on april 23 2003 this provided a net cash increase from the longterm debt issuance of 75 million in 2003 compared to a 200 million increase in 2002 relating to the november 2002 issuance of 515 notes other repayments and retirements of longterm debt were 247 million in 2003 compared to 06 million in 2002 additionally loan proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the sale of contract receivables were 455 million in 2003 compared to 232 million in 2002 

  

other items impacting cash flows from financing activities for 2003 and 2002 include the company’s purchase of shares of its outstanding stock proceeds from the issuance of employee stock options and the payment of dividends through the use of cash provided by operating activities during 2003 and 2002 the company repurchased 14 million and 29 million shares of its outstanding common stock for 552 million and 970 million respectively of the 188 million total shares authorized for repurchase the company has repurchased approximately 167 million shares through december 31 2003 proceeds from the issuance of employee stock options were 391 million in 2003 compared to 285 million in 2002 and 69 million in 2001 additionally during 2003 2002 and 2001 the company paid dividends on its common shares totaling 604 million 418 million and 404 million respectively 

  

the increase in cash used in financing activities from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of an 822 million reduction of proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the sale of contract receivables during 2002 offset by the net of the proceeds from issuance of 200 million of longterm debt in the fourth quarter of 2002 to pay down commercial paper and 1426 million reduction in shortterm loans the additional payments on the proceeds received from financial institutions associated with the transfer of contract receivables is primarily the result of the significant amount of transfers done in 2001 and the fact that certain of the company’s debt covenants limit the amount of contract receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time the 200 million of longterm debt issued in 2002 has a stated interest rate of 515 and is due in november 2012 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices shortterm loans are used to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season 

  

  

the company has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing requirements bank loans and commercial paper supported by available credit are used to meet shortterm financing requirements interest rates on these shortterm loans averaged 12 during 2003 during 2003 the company maintained with a group of banks a threeyear revolving credit agreement providing 250 million of available credit and a 364day credit agreement providing 250 million of available credit that expired in 2005 and 2003 respectively on october 30 2003 the company replaced its existing credit agreements with a 500 million 364 day credit facility which will automatically extend to a three year facility upon receipt of an approval of the pa puc the company received the pa puc approval in the january 2004 the 2003 credit agreement may be used for among other things credit support for the company’s commercial paper program as of december 31 2003 the company has the authority to arrange for a commercial paper program up to 650 million commercial paper of 1996 million is outstanding at december 31 2003 

  

the company’s credit ratings as determined by either standards  poor’s or moody’s on its noncreditenhanced senior unsecured longterm debt determine the level of fees associated with its lines of credit in addition to the interest rate charged by the counterparties on any amounts borrowed against the lines of credit the lower the company’s credit rating the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate as of december 31 2003 the company had not borrowed any amounts against these lines of credit facility fees averaging oneeleventh of one percent in both 2003 and 2002 were paid to maintain credit availability 

  

the company believes that cash generated from operations amounts available under its credit facilities and amounts which the company could obtain in the debt and equity markets given its financial position are more than adequate to meet the company’s reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements 

  

financing triggers 

  

the indentures and other agreements governing the company’s indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict the company’s ability to incur indebtedness incur liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions complete acquisitions sell assets and certain other corporate actions the covenants do not contain a rating trigger therefore in the event that the company’s debt rating changes this event would not trigger a default under the indentures and other agreements governing the company’s indebtedness 

  

risk management 

  

the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of falling commodity prices the company hedges natural gas through financial instruments including forward contracts swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements 

  

equitable has taken advantage of favorable gas prices to significantly hedge production as of december 31 2003 the approximate volumes and prices of equitable’s hedges and fixedprice contracts for 2004 – 2006 are

equity in nonconsolidated investments 

  

westport 

  

the company owns approximately 1153 million shares or 171 of westport which decreased from 208 at the end of 2002 the company does not have operational control of westport the decrease in the company’s ownership in westport is a result of the company’s donation of 905000 shares of westport stock to a community giving foundation on march 31 2003 the sale of approximately 1260000 shares on november 24 2003 and the sale of 220000 shares on december 22 2003 the proceeds from these sales were used to fund contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plan the foundation was established by the company and is projected to facilitate the company’s charitable giving program for approximately 10 years the contribution resulted in charitable contribution expense of 93 million with a corresponding tax benefit of approximately 71 million see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

as a result of the decreased ownership the company changed the accounting treatment for its investment in the first quarter of 2003 from the equity method to availableforsale effective march 31 2003 the change in accounting method eliminated the inclusion of westport’s results subsequent to march 31 2003 in the company’s earnings also the company’s investment in westport was reclassified to investments availableforsale as of march 31 2003 and was adjusted to fair market value in accordance with statement no 115 the equity investment at the time it was reclassified totaled 1341 million as of june 30 2003 the company recorded a reclassification adjustment of 529 million to reduce accumulated other comprehensive income and increase common stock to reflect the increases in the book basis of the company’s investment in westport from previous westport capital transactions therefore the total marktomarket basis of the westport investment was unchanged as of june 30 2003 but the increase in common stock value will prospectively reduce any realized gains on the sale of westport stock by the company due to the increase in book basis to 1653 per share from 1025 per share 

  

the fair market value of the company’s investment in westport was 3442 million as of december 31 2003 and was calculated based upon the quoted market price of westport stock on that date if the company were to immediately liquidate its investment position in westport it would likely be at some discount to the quoted market price the adjusted cost basis of the investment as of december 31 2003 is 1906 million the increase in the carrying value of the investment of 1537 million represents an unrealized gain on the investment which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable tax adjustments 

  

equitable has announced its desire to sell additional shares so that the aggregate number of shares of westport common stock sold in the six months subsequent to october 2003 equals approximately 3000000 the additional sales may occur through an underwritten offering a registered negotiated transaction additional rule 144 transactions or as otherwise permitted under the registration rights agreement equitable is engaged in discussions with westport regarding appropriate means of effecting these additional sales the foregoing is subject

the company owns a 50 interest in another panamanian electric generation project igceri panam thermal generating limited igceri the loan agreement required the project company to retrofit the plant to conform to panamanian environmental noise standards by a target date of august 31 2001 unforeseen events delayed the final completion date of the required retrofits and the project obtained an extension from the panamanian government while the government evaluated a land acquisitionrezoning proposal which if accepted and executed would eliminate the need for a retrofit requirement in september and october 2002 the panamanian government adopted two resolutions that affected the plant’s compliance requirements—by suspending the noise mitigation deadline while the company achieved the objectives of the land acquisition and rezoning proposal and by modifying the noise standards applicable to the plant by making them less stringent in june 2003 the supreme court of panama found unconstitutional the compliance requirement that modified the noise standards applicable to the plant a health ministry decree applying the less restrictive noise standard in a manner the company believes does not violate the june 2003 supreme court capitalized ruling was issued in january 2004 in october 2003 the creditor sponsor advised the project company that if the less restrictive noise standards are made applicable to the plant the project company should execute portions of the land acquisitionrezoning proposal and work with a noise control contractor to achieve a partial technical resolution to the noise condition if the plant is made compliant with 

  

  

the less restrictive noise standard the creditor sponsor has indicated that it will issue a waiver from the loan agreement requirement andor deem the borrower to be in compliance in view of the january 2004 decree the project company expects to execute the land acquisitionrezoning plan in consultation with the creditor sponsor the expected cost to the project company of achieving resolution of this issue is not expected to exceed 15 million and would be funded by project funds 

  

additionally igceri experienced poor financial performance during 2002 due to adverse weather abnormally high rainfall other adverse marketrelated conditions and reduced plant availability related to planned and unplanned outages these factors depressed revenues causing a drop below the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant of the nonrecourse loan document the project company has been actively coordinating with the creditor sponsor on this matter and during the second half of 2002 and year ended 2003 experienced improvement in operational and financial performance despite the debt service coverage ratio issues 2004 cash flows are expected to cover operating expenses and debt service requirements for igceri the company performed an impairment analysis of its equity interest in this project as of december 31 2003 no impairment was required   igceri will compete to sign new longterm power purchase agreements with customers in the second and third quarters of 2004 the outcome of these contracts could impact the value of the company’s investment the company will reassess the impairment analysis late in 2004 the value of the company’s investment in igceri is 217 million at december 31 2003 

  

finally in 2003 igceri inadvertently violated a covenant in the project loan agreement which restricts contracting for certain power sales the violation was disclosed to the creditor sponsor the power sales contract that created the violation expired december 31 2003

newly adopted accounting standards 

  

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” statement no 143 statement no 143 was adopted by the company effective january 1 2003 and its primary impact was to change the method of accruing for well plugging and abandonment costs these costs were formerly recognized as a component of depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense with a corresponding credit to accumulated depletion in accordance with sfas no 19 “financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies” statement no 19 at the end of 2002 the cumulative credit included within accumulated depletion totaled approximately 209 million statement no 143 requires that the fair value of the company’s plugging and abandonment obligations be recorded at the time the obligations are incurred which is typically at the time the wells are drilled upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation the company will increase the carrying amount of the longlived asset by the same amount as the liability over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to dda and the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets 

  

the adoption of statement no 143 by the company resulted in an aftertax charge to earnings of 36 million or 006 per diluted share which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the company’s statement of consolidated income for the year ended december 31 2003 in addition to the charge to earnings the depletion rate in the company’s supply segment increased by 003 per mcfe the company also recognized a 287 million other longterm liability and a 23 million longterm asset upon adoption of statement no 143 the longterm obligation represents the net present value of the estimated future expenditures required to plug and abandon the company’s approximately 12000 wells in appalachia significant portions of which are not projected to occur for over 40 years 

  

the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of the company’s asset retirement obligations the company does not have any assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling these obligations 

  

 

  

assuming retroactive application of the change in accounting principle as of january 1 2002 the pro forma effect of applying this new accounting principle on a retroactive basis would not materially change reported net income for the year ended december 31 2002 longterm liabilities assuming retroactive application of the change in accounting principle as of january 1 2002 and december 31 2002 would have increased by 269 million and 287 million respectively

pension plans

on september 30 2003 the enabling legislation for the performance contracting work that noresco performs for the federal government under the department of energy contracts lapsed and is pending extension in congress until this issue is resolved the noresco segment’s ability to sign new contracts under the department of energy master agreements is affected however the department of defense has informed noresco that it is not interpreting the statutory lapse as prohibiting new awards under existing master agreements 

  

rate regulation 

  

the company’s distribution operations are subject to comprehensive regulation by the pa puc the public service commission of west virginia and to rate regulation by the kentucky public service commission the company’s interstate pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the ferc accounting for the company’s regulated operations is performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 71 “accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation” as described in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through the regulatory process the company believes that it will continue to be subject to rate regulation that will provide for the recovery of the deferred costs 

  

schedule of certain contractual obligations 

  

the following table details the future projected payments associated with the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 

  

   

the indentures and other agreements governing the company’s longterm debt contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict the company’s ability to incur indebtedness incur liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions complete acquisitions sell assets and perform certain other corporate actions the covenants do not contain a rating trigger therefore in the event that the company’s debt rating changes this event would not trigger a default under the indentures and other agreements governing the company’s indebtedness 

  

operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and warehouse buildings as well as a limited amount of equipment in the third quarter of 2003 the company signed a longterm lease for office space with continental real estate companies which will own and construct the building in which the office space will be located plans call for the building to be complete in late 2004 or early 2005 the office space is located at the north shore in pittsburgh pennsylvania and will allow equitable to consolidate its pittsburgh office operations and increase efficiencies the term of the lease is 20 years and nine months and the base rent is approximately 2 million per year relocation of operations from locations that utilize space under longterm leases will likely cause additional expense late in 2004 and 2005 the base rent payments of approximately 2 million per year have been included in the table above with payments commencing in 2005 

  

included within the purchase obligations amount in the table above are annual commitments of approximately 245 million relating to the company’s natural gas distribution and production operations for demand charges under existing longterm contracts with pipeline suppliers for periods extending up to nine years at december 31 2003 approximately 195 million of these costs are recoverable in customer rates 

  

 

contingent liabilities and commitments 

  

there are various claims and legal proceedings against the company arising in the normal course of business although counsel is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome management and counsel believe that the company has significant and meritorious defenses to any claims and intends to pursue them vigorously the company has provided adequate reserves and therefore believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the financial position of the company the reserves recorded by the company do not include any amounts for legal costs expected to be incurred it is the company’s policy to recognize any legal costs associated with any claims and legal proceedings against the company as they are incurred 

  

after an extended period of troubled operations eri jam llc a subsidiary that holds the company’s interest in ealeri cogeneration partners lp an international infrastructure project filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 in us bankruptcy court delaware in april 2003 in the third quarter 2003 eri jam llc transferred control of the international infrastructure project under the partnership agreement to the other general partner the international infrastructure project was deconsolidated in accordance with fin no 46 in september 2003 projectlevel counterparties jamaica broilers group limited jbg and energy associated limited eal filed a claim against eri jam llc as debtorinpossession in the chapter 11 case eal is a limited partner in ealeri cogeneration partners lp in october 2003 jbg and eal also filed a multicount complaint against equitable and certain of its affiliates in us district court western district of pa equitable and its affiliates intend to vigorously defend this litigation which they view as without merit resolution within the chapter 11 proceedings pursuant to a global settlement is sought 

  

the various regulatory authorities that oversee equitable’s operations will from time to time make inquiries or investigations into the activities of the company the company has received informal requests for information from the cftc regarding the reporting of prices to industry publications during 2001 2002 and 2003 the company has cooperated fully with the cftc in this matter as the company always does when regulatory bodies make requests the company has investigated this matter thoroughly internally and uncovered no evidence to date that any of its employees ever intentionally reported any false information to any industry publication 

  

in july 2002 the united states epa published a final rule that amends the oil pollution prevention regulation the effective date of the rule was august 16 2002 under the final rule ownersoperators of existing facilities were to revise their spcc plans on or before february 17 2003 and were required to implement the amended plans as soon as possible but not later than august 18 2003 on april 17 2003 the epa extended the deadline to adopt a plan amendment to august 17 2004 and the deadline to comply with the amended plan to february 18 2005 there is currently active litigation regarding the final rule and management anticipates that the regulation will be modified nonetheless the company is studying and is preparing to implement its plan of compliance the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation and any regulatory modification may affect the company’s ability to timely comply and will affect the total costs of compliance currently expected to be 180 million approximately twothirds of which are expected to be capitalized but were not approved as part of the 2004 capital budget 

  

in addition to the spcc requirement the company is subject to other federal state and local environmental and environmentallyrelated laws and regulations these laws and regulations which are constantly changing can require expenditures for remediation and may in certain instances result in assessment of fines the company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures the estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued however certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets when recoverable through regulated rates ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements have not been material management believes that any such required expenditures will not be significantly different in either their nature or amount in the future and does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have a material effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

  

any estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued with certain costs deferred as regulatory assets as applicable the company has identified situations that require remedial action for which approximately 44 million is included in other longterm liabilities at december 31 2003 

  

 

at the end of the useful life of a well the company is required to remediate the site by plugging and abandoning the well costs associated with this obligation totaled 13 million 07 million and 08 million during the years ended 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

inflation and the effect of changing energy prices 

  

the rate of inflation in the united states has been less than moderate over the past several years and has not significantly affected the profitability of the company in prior periods of high general inflation oil and natural gas prices generally increased at comparable rates however there is no assurance that this will be the case in the current environment or in possible future periods of high inflation regulated utility operations may be required to file a general rate case in order to recover higher costs of operations margins in the energy marketing business in the equitable utilities segment are highly sensitive to competitive pressures and may not reflect the effects of inflation the results of operations in the company’s three business segments will be affected by future changes in oil and natural gas prices and the interrelationship between oil natural gas and other energy prices to help mitigate the effect of any future changes in natural gas prices the company has entered into hedging contracts with respect to forecasted natural gas production at specified prices for a specified period of time the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding the derivative instruments used are outlined in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

audit committee 

  

the audit committee composed entirely of independent directors meets periodically with equitable’s independent auditors and management to review the company’s financial statements and the results of audit activities the audit committee in turn reports to the board of directors on the results of its review and selects the independent auditors 

  

transactions with directors’ affiliated companies 

  

in the course of ordinary business the company may have engaged in transactions with companies and organizations for which an equitable resources director serves as an officer those directors did not have a material interest in any such transactions and none of those transactions exceeded 5 of the gross revenues of either equitable resources or the other organization moreover any such transactions were entered into on armslength terms believed to be fair 

  

 




 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas which can affect the operating results of equitable through the equitable supply segment and the unregulated marketing group within the equitable utilities segment the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the company uses simple nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

for commodity price derivatives used to hedge forecasted company production equitable sets policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk these financial instruments include forward contracts swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements the level of price exposure is limited by the value at risk limits allowed by this policy management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted in general equitable’s strategy is to become more highly hedged for production over the next several years at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels the company believes that prices between 300 and 350 per mcf are sustainable above this range nontraditional supplies become economically feasible furthermore the company expects price volatility to result in prices significantly higher and lower than this range the company attempts to take advantage of these price fluctuations by hedging more aggressively when prices are much higher than the range and by taking more price risk when prices are significantly below the range however the company has typically not hedged material volumes unless the natural gas prices exceed 400 per mcf the goal of these actions is to earn a return above the cost of capital and to lower the cost of capital by reducing cash flow volatility 

  

for commodity price derivatives held for trading positions the marketing group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits these financial instruments include forward contracts swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements 

  

with respect to the energy derivatives held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2003 the company continued to execute its hedging strategy by utilizing price swaps of approximately 2194 bcf of natural gas these derivatives have hedged varying levels of expected equity production through 2010 a decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2003 levels would increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately 1084 million an increase of 10 in market price of natural gas would decrease the fair market value by the same amount with respect to derivative contracts held by the company for trading purposes as of december 31 2003 a decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2003 level would decrease the fair market value by approximately 005 million an increase of 10 in market price of natural gas from the december 31 2003 level would increase the fair market value the same amount the company determined the change in the fair value of the natural gas instruments using a method similar to its normal change in fair value as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company assumed a 10 change in the price of natural gas from its levels at december 31 2003 the price change was then applied to the natural gas instruments recorded on the company’s balance sheet resulting in the change in fair value 

  

the above analysis of the energy derivatives held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term 

  

 

the energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and as applicable anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

the disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions if the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the energy derivatives a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

the company has variable rate shortterm debt as such there is some limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the company under its current capital structure the company maintains fixed rate longterm debt that is not subject to fluctuating interest rates 

  

the company may enter into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to future changes in interest rates but as of december 31 2003 the company had no such instruments outstanding 

  

the company is exposed to market risk associated with its holdings in westport which is accounted for as an investment available for sale the company does not attempt to reduce this risk through the use of derivatives

 item 1 business   

equitable resources inc equitable or the company is an integrated energy company with emphasis on appalachian area natural gas production and gathering natural gas distribution and transmission and energy infrastructure and efficiency solutions primarily in the northeastern section of the united states and in selected international markets the company also has an interest in another public company with oil and gas exploration and production properties in the gulf of mexico and rocky mountain areas the company and its subsidiaries offer energy natural gas crude oil and natural gas liquids products and services to wholesale and retail customers through three business segments equitable utilities equitable production and noresco the company and its subsidiaries had 1500 employees at the end of 2001 

  

the company was formed under the laws of pennsylvania by the consolidation and merger in 1925 of two constituent companies the older of which was organized in 1888 in 1984 the corporate name was changed to equitable resources inc 

  

equitable utilities 

  

equitable utilities contains both regulated and nonregulated operations the regulated group consists of the distribution and interstate pipeline operations while the unregulated group is involved in nonjurisdictional marketing and trading of natural gas risk management activities and the sale of energyrelated products and services equitable utilities generated 41 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2001 

  

natural gas distribution 

  

equitable utilities’ distribution operations are carried out by equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory for equitable gas includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern west virginia and field line sales in eastern kentucky the distribution operations provide natural gas services to approximately 273000 customers comprising 255000 residential customers and 18000 commercial and industrial customers 

  

equitable gas’ natural gas supply portfolio includes shortterm mediumterm and longterm natural gas supply contracts obtained from various sources including purchases from major and independent producers in the southwest united states purchases from local producers in the appalachian area purchases from gas marketers and third party underground storage fields 

  

because many of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes equitable gas’ revenues are seasonal with approximately 65 of calendar year 2001 revenues occurring during the winter heating season januarymarch novemberdecember significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground storage inventory during offpeak season to accommodate higher customer demand during the winter heating season 

  

interstate pipeline 

  

the interstate pipeline operations of equitable utilities include the natural gas transmission and storage activities of equitrans lp equitrans and carnegie interstate pipeline company which are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc the pipeline division offers gas transportation storage and related services to its affiliates and others in the northeast united states 

  

 

the regulatory environment is designed to increase competition in the natural gas industry which has created a number of opportunities for pipeline companies to expand services and serve new markets the company has taken advantage of selected market expansion opportunities by concentrating on equitrans’ underground storage facilities and the location of its pipeline system as a link between the country’s major longline natural gas pipelines 

  

the pipeline operations consist of approximately 2800 miles of transmission storage and gathering lines and interconnections with five major interstate pipelines equitrans also has 15 natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 500 million cubic feet mmcf per day of peak delivery capability equitrans has 59 bcf of storage capacity of which 27 bcf is working gas 

  

energy marketing 

  

equitable utilities’ unregulated marketing operation equitable energy llc purchases stores and markets natural gas at both the retail and wholesale level primarily in the appalachian and midatlantic regions services and products offered by the marketing division include commodity procurement and delivery physical natural gas management operations and control and customer support services to the company’s energy customers to manage the price exposure risk of its marketing operations the company engages in risk management activities including the purchase and sale of financial energy derivative products because of this activity the energy marketing division is also able to offer energy price risk management services to its larger industrial customers 

  

in conjunction with these activities the company also engages in limited trading activity equitable energy uses prudent asset management to hedge projected production and optimize storage capacity assets through trading activities trading activities are entered into with the objective of limiting exposure to shifts in market prices 

  

rates and regulation 

  

equitable’s distribution rates terms of service contracts with affiliates and issuance of securities are regulated primarily by the pennsylvania public utility commission puc along with the kentucky public service commission and the public service commission of west virginia pipeline safety is generally regulated by the rules of the federal department of transportation andor by the state regulatory commission the occupational safety and health administration osha also imposes certain additional safety regulations 

  

the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation including transportation rates storage tariffs and various other matters primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation the ferc’s regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas for additional discussion of regulatory matters involving equitable utilities see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” mda 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

in december 1999 equitable acquired the distribution transmission and production operations of carnegie natural gas company and subsidiaries carnegie for 400 million including transaction costs the carnegie utility operations have been fully integrated into equitable gas the acquisition of carnegie added approximately 8000 new distribution customers see note d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the carnegie acquisition 

  

competitive environment 

  

various regulatory and market trends have combined to promote competition in markets served by equitable gas in addition equitable gas faces price competition with other energy forms the changes precipitated by the ferc restructuring of natural gas transmission in order no 636 have significantly increased competition in the natural gas industry in the restructured marketplace competition is increasing to provide natural gas sales to 

  

 

commercial and residential customers however since equitable gas has been managing transportation service and gas supply risk for a number of years the transition to a more competitive environment under order no 636 has not had a significant impact on its operations equitable gas has responded to this competitive environment by offering a variety of firm and interruptible services including natural gas transportation supply pooling balancing and brokering to industrial and commercial customers 

  

the large industrial market is extremely competitive resulting in very low realized margins the national economic downturn experienced during 2001 has resulted in a significant reduction in industrial activity and volumes particularly related to the domestic steel industry 

  

gas industry competition at the retail level is receiving increased attention from both regulators and legislators in june 1999 pennsylvania enacted into law the natural gas choice and competition act the act which required local natural gas distribution companies to extend the availability of natural gas transportation service to residential and commercial customers by july 1 2000 pursuant to a pucapproved plan the company filed a revised tariff after which a negotiated settlement was reached and approved becoming effective july 1 2001 in 2001 equitable gas made progress on its initiative with the puc to provide for performancebased rates pbr on september 26 2001 the puc issued a final order that provides a guaranteed purchased gas cost credit to customers while enabling equitable gas to share in any cost savings from more effective management of capacity release and offsystem sales revenues this order is effective from october 1 2001 through september 30 2003 

  

the company’s forward plan for pbr which will require puc approval forecasts a phased implementation that will advance new incentive mechanisms for managing commodity costs reducing operating expense optimizing cost of capital and reducing gas line loss 

  

equitable production 

  

equitable production develops produces and sells natural gas and crude oil with operations in the appalachian region of the united states it also engages in natural gas gathering and the processing and sale of natural gas and natural gas liquids equitable production generated approximately 53 of the company’s net operating revenues in 2001 

  

equitable production is the largest owner of proved natural gas reserves in the appalachian basin the oldest and geographically one of the largest natural gas producing regions in the united states equitable production currently owns 7184 net producing wells in appalachia as of december 31 2001 the company estimates the total proved reserves to be 2082 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe including undeveloped reserves of 583 bcfe 

  

the areas in which the company’s appalachian properties are located are characterized by wells with comparatively low rates of annual decline in production low production costs and high british thermal unit btu or energy content for operational and commercial reasons the gas is processed to allow heavier hydrocarbons propane butane and ethane streams to be stripped and sold separately within certain limits the company can vary the amount of the hydrocarbons extracted this can cause the conversion rate between energy content measured in btu to volumes measured in mcfe to vary somewhat once drilled and completed wells in the appalachian basin typically have low ongoing operating and maintenance requirements and require minimal capital expenditures these formations are characterized by slow recovery of the reserves in place low rates of production and wells that generally produce for longer than 20 years and often more than 50 years many of the company’s wells in these areas have been producing for many years in some cases since the early 1900’s reserve estimates for properties with long production histories are generally more reliable than estimates for properties with shorter histories 

  

substantially all of the appalachian wells are relatively shallow with depths ranging from 1000 to 7000 feet below the surface many of these wells are completed in more than one producing zone and production from these zones may be mixed or commingled commingled production lowers producing costs on a per unit basis compared to isolated zone completions 

  

 

in the appalachian region during 2001 equitable production drilled 316 gross wells at a success rate of 100 this drilling was concentrated within the core areas of southwest virginia west virginia and southeast kentucky this activity resulted in an incremental 30 mmcf per day of gas sales and developed reserve additions of 117 bcfe 

  

equitable production currently has an inventory of 36 million gross acres of which approximately 71 has not been developed as of december 31 2001 the company estimated the proved undeveloped reserves of the underlying leases to be 583 bcfe from 1800 proved undeveloped drilling locations in the last three years equitable production has completed substantially all of the wells it has drilled in appalachia 

  

in july 2001 equitrans filed an order with the ferc to transfer five natural gas pipeline gathering systems located in west virginia and pennsylvania to the equitable production business segment on february 13 2002 the ferc approved the order that resulted in the transfer of gathering systems the transfer will be effective january 1 2002 for segment reporting purposes the systems transferred consist of approximately 1300 miles of low pressure small diameter pipeline and related facilities used to gather gas from wells in the region the effect of this transfer is not material to the results of operations or financial position of equitable utilities or equitable production 

  

in december 1999 the unregulated production properties and well operations of equitable utilities’ equitrans interstate pipeline division were transferred to equitable production these properties included 800 producing natural gas wells and 389 bcfe of proved developed reserves 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

in february 2000 the company acquired the appalachian production assets of statoil energy inc statoil for 630 million plus working capital adjustments for a total of 677 million statoil’s operations consisted of approximately 1200 billion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves and 6500 gross natural gas wells in west virginia kentucky virginia pennsylvania and ohio 

  

in april 2000 the company merged its gulf of mexico operations with westport oil and gas company for 50 million in cash and 15236 million shares or approximately 49 interest in the combined company named westport resources corporation westport in october 2000 westport completed an initial public offering ipo of its shares equitable sold 1325 million shares in this ipo for an aftertax gain of 43 million this ipo reduced the company’s ownership to approximately 36 interest in westport on august 21 2001 westport resources completed a merger with belco oil  gas company equitable continues to own 13911 million shares which now represents approximately 27 of westport’s total shares outstanding at december 31 2001 the book value of equitable’s equity in westport was 1481 million as of december 31 2001 

  

in june 2000 the company sold properties previously acquired from statoil with reserves of 660 bcfe that qualified for nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership for proceeds of 1222 million in cash and a retained minority interest in this partnership the proceeds received were used to pay down shortterm debt associated with the statoil acquisition prior to this transaction the company entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a 70 million pretax charge recorded as other loss in june 2000 the company accounts for its remaining 262 million investment under the equity method of accounting during 2001 and 2000 the company received 89 million and 49 million respectively in fees for operating the wells gathering the production and marketing the gas on behalf of the purchaser additionally the company estimates that it will receive approximately 85 million in fees for the performance of the same services in 2002 based on expected production volumes 

  

in december 2000 the company sold gas properties previously acquired from statoil with reserves of 1333 bcfe to a trust for proceeds of 2558 million and a retained minority interest in this trust in anticipation of this transaction the company had previously entered into financial hedges removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a 577 million charge that completely offset the gain recognized on the sale of these properties the proceeds received were used to pay down shortterm debt associated with the statoil acquisition the company accounts for its 362 million investment under the equity method of accounting during 2001 the 

  

 

company received 161 million in fees for operating the wells gathering the production and marketing the gas on behalf of the purchaser no fees were generated in 2000 related to this sale additionally the company estimates that it will receive approximately 146 million in fees for the performance of the same services in 2002 based on expected production volumes 

  

in december 2000 the company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales contracts for a total of approximately 527 mmcf of reserves the company is required to deliver certain fixed quantities of natural gas during the term of the contracts the first contract is for five years with net proceeds of 1040 million the second contract is for three years with net proceeds of 1048 million these contracts were recorded as prepaid forward sales and are being recognized in income as deliveries occur the proceeds received were used to pay down shortterm debt associated with the statoil acquisition 

  

in december 2001 the company sold its oildominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities the sale resulted in a decrease of 63 bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately 60 million the field produced approximately 37 bcfe annually the proceeds are shown in the balance sheet as restricted cash see note f for additional information related to the restricted cash although the company will no longer operate these properties it will continue to gather and market the natural gas produced for a fee these fees are estimated to be approximately 13 million in 2002 

  

see notes c and d to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the company’s acquisitions and divestitures 

  

competitive environment 

  

the combination of its longlived production low drilling costs high drilling completion rates at shallow depths and proximity to natural gas markets has had a substantial impact on the development of the appalachian basin resulting in a highly fragmented operating environment in 2001 kentucky and west virginia had approximately 4500 independent operators and 100000 producing natural gas and oil wells also the historical availability of tax incentives has resulted in extensive drilling in the shallow formations with these low technical risk characteristics 

  

hedging activities 

  

equitable has historically entered into hedging contracts with respect to forecasted natural gas production at specified prices for a specified period of time the company’s hedging strategy and information regarding derivative instruments used are outlined below in item 7a “qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk” and in note b to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies involving significant estimates   

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon equitable’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities the following critical accounting policies affect the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

revenue recognition revenues for regulated natural gas sales to retail customers are recognized as service is rendered including an accrual for unbilled revenues from the date of each meter reading to the end of the accounting period revenue is recognized for exploration and production activities when deliveries of natural gas crude oil and natural gas liquids occur revenues from natural gas transportation and storage activities are recognized in the period the service is provided revenues from energy marketing activities are recognized when deliveries occur revenues from activities classified as energy trading are recognized immediately 

  

the company recognizes revenue from shared energy savings contracts as energy savings are measured and verified revenue received from customer contract termination payments is recognized when received revenue from other longterm contracts including energy savings performance contracts such as turnkey contracts is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis determined using the costtocost method see below for expanded discussion of this method any maintenance revenues are recognized as related services are performed 

  

oil  gas properties  successful efforts method equitable uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities the successful efforts method has only the cost of successful drilling capitalized as oil and gas properties costs of exploratory dry holes geological and geophysical delay rentals and other property carrying costs are charged to expense all general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred depreciation depletion and amortization of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are computed using the unitofproduction method by aggregation of properties 

  

the costs of unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed on a fieldbyfield basis if unproved properties are determined to be productive the related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if unproved properties are determined not to be productive or if the value has been otherwise impaired the excess carrying value is charged to expense 

  

for purposes of determining whether proved oil and gas properties have been impaired equitable utilizes forward market prices including estimates of forward market prices for periods that extend beyond those with quoted market prices as of the evaluation date in estimating the future cash flows from the oil and gas properties this forward market price information is consistent with that generally used in drilling and acquisition planning and decision making in the impairment calculation these market prices for future periods are used to value the estimated production from proved reserves for the corresponding periods in arriving at future cash flows no changes in production from the profile included in the yearend reserve report are assumed 

  

the carrying value of the company’s proved oil and gas properties are reviewed on a fieldbyfield basis for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable in order to determine whether impairment has occurred equitable estimates the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from the company’s proved oil and gas properties and compares them to their respective carrying values the estimated future cash flows used to test those properties for recoverability are based 

  

 

on proved reserves utilizing our assumptions about the use of the asset and forward market prices for oil and gas proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of undiscounted future cash flows are deemed unrecoverable those properties are then written down to fair value which is estimated using assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value in developing estimates of fair value the company used forward market prices for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 the company did not recognize impairment charges on oil and gas properties 

  

percentage of completion method of accounting noresco recognizes revenue and profit as work on longterm contracts progresses using the percentage of completion method of accounting the method relies on estimates of total expected costs noresco follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates which are assessed continually during the term of the contract recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known accordingly favorable changes in estimates result in additional profit recognition and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profits when estimates indicate a loss under a contract cost of sales is charged with a provision for such loss as work progresses under a loss contract revenues continue to be recognized and a portion of the contract costs incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve the company had no loss contracts as of december 31 2001 

  

hedging and derivatives    equitable’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas the company uses a variety of techniques to minimize this exposure which includes sales of gas properties other monetizations and prepaid natural gas sales the company also uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effect of this volatility the company’s strategy is to become more highly hedged at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels the company uses simple nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose credit worthiness is continually monitored the corporate risk committee and board of directors approved a set of policies that guides the use of these derivative financial instruments equitable’s use of these derivatives is further explained in note b to the consolidated financial statements and in part ii item 7a “qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk”  

  

with respect to hedging the company’s exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices under current market conditions management’s objective is to reduce its exposure to commodity price changes to 001 of earnings per diluted share per 010 change in the average nymex natural gas price for 2002 003 per diluted share for 2003 and less than 004 per diluted share for 2004 through 2008 in addition to monetizations the company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure the company has relied almost exclusively on fixed price swaps to accomplish the remainder of this objective during 2001 due to the increased market volatility 

  

equitable also conducts trading activities through an unregulated marketing group the function of the trading business is to contribute to earnings by taking market positions within defined limits subject to the company’s corporate risk management policy these derivatives include forward contracts which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the difference between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements the company’s management made a strategic decision to limit trading activities during 2001 

  

newly issued accounting standards   in july 2001 the fasb issued statement no 141 business combinations and statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets both of which are effective for fiscal year 2002 statement no 141 eliminates the poolingofinterests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 and further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill under statement no 142 goodwill and indefinite intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives the company has recorded goodwill of 574 million at december 31 2001 

  

 

application of the nonamortization provisions of statement no 142 is expected to result in an increase in annual net income of approximately 37 million during 2002 the company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and therefore has not yet determined the effect these tests will have on the earnings and financial position of the company 

  

in august 2001 the fasb issued statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations which will be effective for fiscal year 2003 this statement requires asset retirement obligations to be measured at fair value and to be recognized at the time the obligation is incurred during 2002 management will assess the impact if any of this pronouncement on the earnings and financial position of the company 

  

in october 2001 the fasb issued statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which will be effective for fiscal year 2002 statement 144 provides a single accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as heldforsale based on current circumstances the company believes the application of the new rules will not have a material impact on the earnings and financial position of the company 

  

consolidated results of operations 

  

equitable’s consolidated net income from continuing operations for 2001 was 1518 million or 230 per diluted share compared with 1062 million or 160 per diluted share for 2000 and 691 million or 101 per diluted share for 1999 

  

the improved 2001 earnings are due to higher realized selling prices incremental natural gas production attributable to a full year of production from the acquired statoil appalachian oil and gas properties and lower operating expenses throughout the organization due to continuing process improvement efforts in all significant business units the improved 2001 earnings were partially offset by unusually warm weather resulting in reduced throughput volumes 

  

earnings for 2000 increased over 1999 as a result of increased natural gas production increased throughput in the regulated distribution operations primarily due to colder weather lower exploration costs and lower operating and administrative expenses throughout the organization 

  

business segment results 

  

business segment operating results are presented in the segment discussions and financial tables on the following pages results for the investment in westport are not attributed to a business segment headquarters’ operating expenses are billed to operating segments based on a fixed allocation of the annual operating budget differences between budget and actual expenses are not allocated to operating segments certain performancerelated incentive costs and administrative costs totaling 80 million and 112 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively were not allocated prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 

  

equitable utilities 

  

equitable utilities’ operations comprise the sale and transportation of natural gas to customers at stateregulated rates interstate pipeline transportation and storage of natural gas subject to federal regulation and the unregulated marketing of natural gas and limited trading activities 

  

natural gas distribution 

  

the local distribution operations of equitable gas company equitable gas a division of the company provides natural gas services in southwestern pennsylvania and to municipalities in northern west virginia in addition equitable gas provides field line sales in eastern kentucky equitable gas is subject to rate regulation by state regulatory commissions in pennsylvania west virginia and kentucky 

  

gas industry competition at the retail level is receiving increased attention from both regulators and legislators in june 1999 pennsylvania enacted into law the natural gas choice and competition act the act which required local natural gas distribution companies to extend the availability of natural gas transportation 

  

 

service to residential and commercial customers by july 1 2000 pursuant to a pucapproved plan the company filed a revised tariff after which a negotiated settlement was reached and approved becoming effective july 1 2001 in 2001 equitable gas made progress with the puc to provide for performancebased rates pbr in 2001 on september 26 2001 the puc issued a final order that provides a guaranteed purchased gas cost credit to customers while enabling equitable gas to share in any cost savings from more effective management of capacity release and offsystem sales revenues this order is effective from october 1 2001 through september 30 2003 

  

interstate pipeline 

  

the pipeline operations of equitrans lp equitrans and carnegie interstate pipeline carnegie pipeline subsidiaries of the company are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under present rates a majority of the annual costs are recovered through fixed charges to customers equitrans filed a rate case in april 1997 which addressed the recovery of certain stranded plant costs related to the implementation of ferc order no 636 the requested rates were placed into effect in august 1997 subject to refund pending the issuance of a final order on april 29 1999 the ferc approved without modification the joint stipulated settlement agreement resolving all issues in the proceeding 

  

the approved settlement provided for prospective collection of increased gathering charges in addition the settlement provided equitrans the opportunity to retain all revenues associated with interruptible transportation and negotiated rate agreements as well as moving its gathering charge toward a costbased rate in the second quarter of 1999 equitrans recorded the final settlement of the rate case the final settlement includes the adjustment of the prior provisions for refund and recognition of the previously deferred revenues and costs related to the stranding of certain gathering facilities 

  

during 1999 the company owned a third interstate pipeline three rivers pipeline company which was interconnected with equitrans on november 29 1999 equitrans filed an application with the ferc to acquire and operate the assets of three rivers pipeline company that was granted by an order dated april 13 2000 

  

in july 2001 equitrans filed an order with the ferc to transfer five natural gas pipeline gathering systems located in west virginia and pennsylvania to the equitable production business segment in february 2002 the ferc approved the order that resulted in the transfer of gathering systems the transfer will be effective january 1 2002 for segment reporting purposes the systems transferred consist of approximately 1300 miles of low pressure small diameter pipeline and related facilities used to gather gas from wells in the region the effect of this transfer is not material to the results of operations or financial position of equitable utilities or equitable production and therefore the results have not been restated for this transfer 

  

energy marketing 

  

equitable utilities’ unregulated marketing entity provides commodity procurement and delivery risk management and customer services to energy consumers including large industrial utility commercial institutional and residential endusers this division’s primary focus is to provide products and services in those areas where the company has a strategic marketing advantage usually due to geographic coverage and ownership of physical or contractual assets 

  

in conjunction with these activities the company also engages in limited trading activity equitable energy uses prudent asset management to optimize the company’s assets through trading activities trading activities are entered into with the objective of limiting exposure from shifts in market prices 

  

capital expenditures 

  

equitable utilities forecasts 2002 capital expenditures to be approximately 80 million a significant increase over capital expenditures of 385 million for 2001 the 2002 capital expenditures include 2001 capital commitments totaling 45 million and planned expenditures from 2002 commitments totaling 35 million the total 2002 expenditures include 46 million for utilities infrastructure improvements 23 million for technology enhancements and 11 million for new business development the infrastructure improvements include maintenance and improvements to existing distribution and transmission lines as well as storage enhancements the technology expenditures are related to mobilization and automation initiatives while the new business capital is planned for distribution extension projects 

  

 

equitable utilities 

  

   

equitable utilities had operating income of 790 million for 2001 compared with 930 million for 2000 the lower results for 2001 are primarily due to reduced revenues resulting from warm weather charges related to pipeline operations workforce reductions and a charge related to a decision to add a 70 million incremental creditrelated reserve 

  

operating income for equitable utilities increased 153 from 1999 to 2000 the increase in 2000 is a result of higher net revenues due principally to the carnegie acquisition and cooler weather during the heating season results for the 2000 period include 09 million for the recovery of stranded costs in rates from the previously mentioned equitrans rate case settlement which was partially offset by charges of 15 million for improvement of utility segment operating processes and consolidation of facilities results for 1999 benefited from the recognition of the settlement of equitrans’ rate case which included stranded cost recovery that had a positive net result of 38 million this benefit was partially offset by charges of 30 million for improvement of utility segment operating processes and consolidation of facilities excluding the impact of the rate case settlement and process improvement charges in both periods operating income increased 138 million or 173 over the 797 million in 1999 

  

distribution operations 

  

   

   om is defined for this calculation as the sum of operating and maintenance and selling general and administrative expenses excluding other taxes

  

 

   

net revenues for 2001 were 1546 million compared to 1599 million in 2000 heating degreedays were 5059 for 2001 which is 10 warmer than the 5596 degree days recorded in 2000 and 15 warmer than the 30year normal of 5968 the warmer weather had a negative yearoveryear impact on net revenues of approximately 78 million which was partially offset by increased delivery margins commercial and industrial volumes declined 25 from prior year primarily due to the economic decline in the domestic steel industry the negative net revenue impact from warm weather was partially mitigated by an increase in industrial demand charge revenues from new customers and reduced gas costs for nonregulated commercial and industrial customers particularly in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

total operating expenses increased 58 million or 7 from 785 million in 2000 the increase is attributable to a 70 million charge for incremental creditrelated reserves in the fourth quarter of 2001 the increased operating expenses were partially offset by reduced operations and maintenance expenses related to continued process improvement initiatives 

  

net revenues for the distribution operations increased 103 from 1999 to 2000 the increase in net revenues for 2000 is due principally to the total system throughput increase from the carnegie gas acquisition and the impact of weather that was 2 colder than the prior year weather in the distribution service territory during 2000 was 6 warmer than the 30year average 

  

operating expenses for the distribution operations for 2000 increased 72 from 1999 the increase in 2000 is due principally to the acquisition of carnegie gas increased provision for performancerelated bonuses and higher administrative costs 

  

pipeline operations 

  

   

net revenues from pipeline operations increased to 621 million from 611 million in 2000 pipeline revenues in 2000 include 38 million for the recovery of stranded costs in rates from the previously mentioned equitrans’ rate case settlement excluding the 38 million from the settlement in 2000 the net revenues increased 8 from the prior year this increase is largely associated with the storagerelated service revenues resulting from improved asset utilization the 2001 transportation throughput decline in 2001 from prior year of 13 is primarily due to the reduced residential throughput resulting from the warmer weather than prior year and 30year average 

  

 

operating expenses increased by 42 million from 290 million in 2000 the increased operating expenses are due to the june 2001 and september 2001 charges for workforce reductions and process improvements related to compressor automation totaling 60 million the onetime charges were partially offset by reduced operations and maintenance costs associated with the current year workforce reductions and continued process improvement initiatives 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses for 2000 included 29 million of amortization expense related to the recovery of stranded costs in rates excluding the amortization expense from 2000 total depreciation and amortization expenses increased minimally due to the 2001 capital expenditure program 

  

net revenues for the pipeline operations decreased 166 from 1999 to 2000 pipeline revenues in 2000 include 38 million for the recovery of stranded costs in rates from the previously mentioned equitrans’ rate case settlement revenues in 1999 include 172 million related to recognition of the rate settlement passthrough of stranded costs and passthrough of ferc surcharges and products extraction costs excluding the impact of the rate settlement net revenues increased 12 million primarily due to the increased throughput from the carnegie interstate pipeline acquisition and increased gathering and storage services 

  

operating expenses for the pipeline operations decreased 109 from 1999 to 2000 the operating expenses for 2000 include 29 million of amortization expense related to the recovery of stranded costs in rates operating expenses for 1999 include 116 million of amortization expense related to the recovery of stranded costs 40 million for utility segment process improvements and 17 million of passthrough products extraction costs excluding the impact of these items in both periods operating expenses of 360 million for 2000 increased by 24 million the increase in operating expenses for 2000 excluding these items in both periods was principally due to the acquisition of carnegie interstate pipeline and increased provisions for performancerelated bonuses 

  

energy marketing 

  

   

net revenues for energy marketing operations decreased 25 million or 15 from 165 million in 2000 the decrease was due to lower per unit margins and an 11 reduction in volumes the decline in volume is in line with the company’s strategic decision to reduce its trading activities which generally generate low margins and as a result are not a significant component of operating income 

  

operating expenses decreased 11 from 2000 to 2001 the decline in operating expenses is associated with a reduction in workforce due to the strategic decision to limit trading activities in 2001 and from increased investment costs in asset management and retail marketing activities 

  

net revenues for energy marketing operations increased 713 from 1999 to 2000 the increase in net revenues is attributable to greater sales volumes associated with asset management activities and higher unit margins in addition the sale of gas in storage during the first quarter of 2000 allowed the company to benefit from the increasing natural gas prices 

  

operating expenses increased 501 from 1999 to 2000 the increase in expenses is due principally to the increased investment in the segment’s asset management and retail marketing activities 

  

 

equitable production 

  

equitable production develops produces and sells natural gas and crude oil with operations in the appalachian region of the united states it also engages in natural gas gathering and the processing and sale of natural gas and natural gas liquids in april 2000 the company merged its equitable production — gulf business with westport oil and gas company to form westport resources corporation westport in which the company retains an equity interest  the operations of equitable production — gulf through the date of the merger are presented after the operations of equitable production appalachian 

  

equitable production appalachian 

  

during calendar 2000 equitable production completed several transactions which affects the comparability of the financial data between 2000 and 2001 

  

in february 2000 equitable production acquired the appalachian production assets of statoil for 630 million plus working capital adjustments for a total of 677 million statoil’s operations consisted of approximately 1200 billion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves and 6500 natural gas wells in west virginia kentucky virginia pennsylvania and ohio 

  

monetizations 

  

in december of 2001 the company sold its oildominated fields in order to focus on natural gas activities the sale resulted in a decrease in 63 bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and 5 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for proceeds of approximately 60 million the field produced approximately 37 bcfe annually the proceeds are shown in the balance sheet as restricted cash see note f for additional information related to the restricted cash 

  

prepaid natural gas sales 

  

during 2000 the company utilized two prepaid natural gas sales transactions in order to limit its exposure to commodity volatility to reduce counterparty risk and to raise capital these contracts are based upon energy content or btu the company converts these to their volumetric equivalents or mcfe using a factor of 105 btu per mcfe 

  

in december 2000 equitable sold approximately 261 bcf of future production for proceeds of 104 million this natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability under the terms of this sales contract the company must deliver approximately 14300 mcf per day for five years starting january 1 2001 the company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered 

  

in december 2000 equitable sold approximately 266 bcf of future production for proceeds of 105 million this natural gas advance sales contract is treated as a prepaid forward sale and is recorded as a liability under the terms of this sales contract the company must deliver approximately 24300 mcf per day for three years starting january 1 2001 the company recognizes the revenue from this sale as natural gas is gathered and delivered 

  

below is a table that details the specifics of the company’s various prepaid transactions as of december 31 2001 and 2000 

  

   

  

sales of gas properties 

  

occasionally the company enters into a sale of gas properties in order to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility to reduce counterparty risk eliminate production risk and to raise capital while providing the company marketbased fees associated with the gathering marketing and operation of these producing properties 

  

in june 2000 equitable sold properties with approximately 660 bcfe of reserves to a partnership eastern seven partners lp esp for proceeds of 122 million and a retained interest in the partnership this sale of gas properties reduces the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years the company retained an interest in the partnership which is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments under the equity method of accounting the transaction contains a provision under certain circumstances for the company’s equity interest to increase the company separately negotiated armslength marketbased rates for gathering marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver their natural gas to the market the underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term as the operator of the gas properties in the partnership the company may from time to time have receivables outstanding from esp of up to 10 million 

  

in december 2000 equitable sold properties with approximately 1333 bcfe of reserves to a trust appalachian natural gas trust anpi for proceeds of 256 million and a retained interest in the trust this sale of gas properties will reduce the natural gas production revenue and reserves reported in subsequent years the company retained an interest in the trust which is recorded as equity in nonconsolidated investments under the equity method of accounting the transaction contains a provision under certain circumstances for the company’s equity interest to increase the company separately negotiated armslength marketbased rates for gathering marketing and operating fees with the partnership in order to deliver their natural gas to the market the underlying contracts associated with these fees are subject to annual renewal after an initial term as the operator of the gas properties and as a result of a separate agreement the company receives a marketbased fee for providing a restricted line of credit to the trust that is limited by the fair market value of their remaining reserves 

  

below is a table that details the specifics of the company’s various sales of gas properties as of december 31 2001 and 2000 

  

   

in november 1995 the company monetized appalachian gas properties qualifying for nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership appalachian basin partners abp the company recorded the proceeds as deferred revenue which was recognized as production occurred the company retained a partnership interest in the properties that increases substantially based on the attainment of a performance target the performance target was met at the end of 2001 beginning in 2002 the company will no longer include abp volumes as monetized sales but instead as equity production sales as a result monetized volumes sold will decrease by approximately 89 bcf while equity production will increase by the same amount the company will consolidate the partnership starting in 2002 and the remaining portion not owned by the company will result in a minority interest the company will also begin receiving a greater percentage of the nonconventional fuels tax credit based on its increased ownership 

  

capital expenditures 

  

equitable production forecasts the 2002 capital budget to be approximately 107 million this includes 84 million for development of appalachian holdings 16 million for improvements to gathering system pipelines and 7 million for technology initiatives this forecasted level of development drilling is designed to allow for supply volumes to remain consistent with 2001 levels the evaluation of new development locations market forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering system investments 

  

  

equitable production appalachian 

operational and financial data 

  

 

a   volumes sold associated with the company’s two prepaid natural gas sales contracts and the abp partnership discussed above 

b   revenues associated with the use of pipelines and other equipment to collect process and deliver natural gas from the field where it is produced to the trunk or main transmission line many contracts are for a blended gas commodity and gathering price in this case the company utilizes standard measures in order to split the price into its two components 

c   includes equity volumes monetized volumes and volumes in which interests were sold but which the company still operates for a fee 

d   includes operated volumes plus volumes gathered for third parties 

  

   

 

revenues from production which are derived primarily from the sale of produced natural gas increased slightly from 2000 to 2001 the increase in revenues from production of 4 million from 2000 to 2001 is due primarily to higher effective commodity prices offset by the june and december 2000 sale of gas properties 203 bcfe increases in sales volumes due to a full year ownership of the statoil assets 43 bcfe and production from wells shut in or damaged during a fourth quarter 2000 work stoppage 14 bcfe equitable production’s average selling prices for natural gas increased 28 over the same period the revenue from gathering fees increased 15 primarily due to the increase in gathered volumes consistent with the increase in sales volumes noted above from the statoil assets and absence of a work stoppage in 2001 the gathering fee increases were not offset by the june and december 2000 asset sales as the production from these wells is still gathered and compressed by the company other revenues increased by 13 due to increased service fees from the 2000 sales of gas properties 

  

operating expenses for the period ended december 31 2001 decreased 26 from the same period in 2000 this decrease was primarily due to the reduction in operating costs related to the sale of gas properties to a partnership and a trust discussed above additional positive items included the absence of strikerelated expenses incurred in 2000 lower depletion expense and operating improvements in the kentucky west pipeline unit offset by increased operating expenses due to full year ownership of statoil assets gathering and compression expenses per mcfe decreased 15 due to operating improvements in the kentucky west pipeline unit and lower cost gathering on the acquired assets general and administrative expenses per mcfe declined 13 due to ongoing synergies from the acquisition and increase in gathering system throughput depletion expense was reduced both in total and on a perunit basis as a result of the production asset sales in calendar 2000 

  

revenues from production increased 1436 from 1999 to 2000 the increase in revenues from production of 1331 million from 1999 to 2000 is due primarily to increases in sales volumes related to the statoil acquisition and higher effective commodity prices the statoil acquisition added 321 bcfe of sales in 2000 equitable production’s average selling prices for natural gas increased 330 over the same period the increase in revenues realized was reduced by the recognition of 776 million in hedge losses the revenue from gathering fees increased 826 primarily due to the increase in gathered volumes related to the statoil acquisition other revenues increased by 60 million due to the sale of nonconventional fuels tax credits acquired from statoil and from service fee recoveries 

  

operating expenses for the period ended december 31 2000 totaled 1685 million an increase of 830 million from the same period in 1999 with the increase due primarily to the statoil acquisition gathering and compression expenses per mcfe decreased 182 due to lower cost gathering on the acquired assets general and administrative expenses per mcfe declined 303 due to initial synergies from the acquisitions severance taxes per mcfe increased due to increased natural gas sales prices 

  

on december 10 2000 a labor situation involving the kentucky west virginia unit of the equitable production segment and members of the local pace labor union was settled after a 56day strike which had curtailed production in the region the agreement reached between the company and the union resulted in a decrease in the represented work force in this unit by 85 people this reduction from 152 to 67 employees resulted in a fourth quarter charge of 187 million recorded as operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated income statement cost savings from the labor settlement were approximately 50 million in 2001 

  

equitable production—gulf 

  

as described above the equitable production – gulf operations were merged into westport effective april 1 2000 as such there is no activity for the production – gulf operation in 2001 the following description includes results prior to the merger during 2000 seven gross wells were drilled at a success rate of 86 

  

in the gulf region during 1999 153 gross wells were drilled at a success rate of 82 this activity resulted in additions of 485 bcfe the increase was the result of successful development of the west cameron block 180 and 198 fields and south marsh island 39 field equitable production – gulf operated both fields 

  

equitable production also participated in exploratory activity during 1999 including a successful well at south timbalier 196 in which equitable production had a 50 working interest unsuccessful exploratory activity during 1999 on the west cameron 575 and the eugene island 44 blocks resulted in dry hole expense of approximately 25 million in 1999 

  

  

production – gulf operation 

  

   

results of operations for the gulf in 2000 include only the first quarter during that period revenues per mcfe increased 18 over the full year 1999 average due to increased commodity prices sales volumes decreased due to the faster decline of gulf production and decreased drilling during 2000 operating expenses per unit were essentially unchanged from 1999

revenue backlog increased to 1283 million at yearend 2001 from 910 million at yearend 2000 the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to an increase in federal government contracts substantially all the backlog is expected to be completed within the next 18 months 

  

total construction completed during 2001 was 1030 million versus 851 million in 2000 an increase of 179 million over 2000 this increase was primarily due to the increased construction backlog at the beginning of 2001 versus the beginning of 2000 

  

revenues increased from 2000 to 2001 by 228 million or 169 due primarily to the increase in construction backlog at the beginning of 2001 versus the beginning of 2000 gross margins decreased to 220 in 2001 from 248 in 2000 reflecting a change in the mix of projects constructed during the year gross margins have trended downwards slightly over the past three years due to competitive pressures the gross margin in 1999 was 215 

  

sga expenses were flat from 2000 to 2001 included in sga expenses in 2001 were 14 million related to office consolidations in the third quarter included in sga expenses in 2000 were 10 million related to the decision to discontinue developing international energy infrastructure projects and 04 million of additional costs related to the closing of three unprofitable energy services contracting offices in the northwest united states 

  

depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense increased from 2000 to 2001 by 06 million or 122 this increase is primarily due to increased dda for power plant projects 

  

equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments of 76 million in 2001 and 51 million in 2000 reflects noresco’s share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets the increase in earnings was primarily due to improved earnings in the power plants in panama 

  

revenue backlog increased to 910 million at yearend 2000 from 710 million at yearend 1999 the increase in backlog was attributable to an increase in the energy infrastructure project backlog 

  

total construction completed during 2000 was 851 million versus 1517 million a decrease of 666 million over 1999 this decrease was primarily due to a 45 million decrease in construction of energy infrastructure projects in 1999 

  

revenues decreased from 1999 to 2000 by 350 million or 206 primarily caused by low construction backlog at the beginning of 2000 versus the beginning of 1999 gross margins increased to 248 in 2000 from 215 in 1999 reflecting a focus on higher margin products and services and a gross profit increase in a few operational energy services projects 

  

 

sga expenses increased from 1999 to 2000 by 30 million increases during 2000 included 10 million related to the decision to discontinue developing international energy infrastructure projects and the costs associated with the integrating of this division with the energy services contracting division other costs include 04 million of additional costs related to the closing of three unprofitable energy services contracting offices in the northwest united states 

  

depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense decreased from 1999 to 2000 by 08 million or 127 this decrease was primarily due to a writedown of computer software development in 1999 

  

equity income from nonconsolidated investments of 51 million in 2000 and 29 million in 1999 reflects noresco’s share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant assets primarily a 50 megawatt facility in panama which is 50 owned by the company a 96 megawatt facility in panama and a 7 megawatt facility in providence ri were brought on line in late 1999 

  

other income statement items 

  

other income 

  

   

equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments increased in 2001 due to the favorable performance of the noresco segment’s investments in several independent power plant projects equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments increased in 2000 primarily due to the equity earnings from the company’s ownership in westport resources corporation westport in october 2000 westport completed an initial public offering ipo of its shares equitable sold 1325 million shares in this ipo for an aftertax gain of 43 million this reduced the company’s ownership to approximately 36 interest in westport on august 21 2001 westport resources completed a merger with belco oil  gas equitable continues to own 13911 million shares which now represents approximately 27 of westport’s total shares outstanding at december 31 2001 equitable’s equity in westport was 1481 million as of december 31 2001 

  

on june 30 2000 equitable sold a substantial portion of gas properties which qualified for nonconventional fuels tax credit to a partnership which netted 1222 million in cash and retained a minority interest in the partnership in anticipation of this transaction the company had previously entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a 70 million pretax charge recorded as other loss 

  

interest charges 

  

   

interest costs decreased in 2001 as a result of a 472 million decrease in average shortterm debt outstanding due to the reduction in short term debt originally extended to finance the statoil acquisition in february of 2000 and subsequently extinguished with the proceeds from the two prepaid natural gas sales and the sale of natural gas properties discussed above 

  

 

interest costs increased in 2000 as a result of the statoil acquisition which increased average debt outstanding by 580 million the outstanding debt was reduced significantly during the fourth quarter by the proceeds received from the two prepaid gas forward sales the sale of gas properties interest expense also increased as a result of higher interest rates in 2000 compared to 1999 

  

average annual interest rates on shortterm debt were 41 64 and 52 for 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

operating activities 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities were 1299 million in 2001 compared to 3612 million in 2000 and 1543 million in 1999 excluding the 2093 million cash received in december 2000 from the two prepaid natural gas sales cash flows from operations decreased 220 million net income increased 456 million over 2000 which was attributed to higher commodity prices throughout the first three quarters of 2001 depletion expense was lower than prior year primarily due to the two term interest sales of oil and gas properties in 2000 while deferred income tax expense was slightly higher over prior year in addition increased monetized production revenue recognition was included in net income that did not affect operating cash flows 

  

equitable utilities distribution and energy marketing operations had decreased accounts receivable and deferred purchased gas costs due to the warmer weather reduced trading activity and lower commodity prices late in 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 this positive operating cash flow effect was partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable and the increase in inventory also attributable to the circumstances mentioned above 

  

as discussed above the company entered into two prepaid natural gas sales during 2000 and a monetization in 1995 revenue is recognized from these transactions as the natural gas is delivered to the purchasing parties as the actual cash receipts for these transactions took place at the contract inception any amounts recognized in income are a noncash item and is included as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities these amounts were 845 million 137 million and 130 million as of december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively 

  

investing activities 

  

cash flows used in investing activities were 1258 million in 2001 compared to 3630 million in 2000 and 1375 million in 1999 cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of 630 million of proceeds from the oildominated fields sale at yearend the 630 million proceeds remained in a restricted escrow account which offset the cash inflow cash used in investing activities in 2000 primarily includes the acquisition of statoil properties for 677 million and the increase in equity in nonconsolidated investments due to the westport merger partially offset by the net proceeds received from the sales of producing properties and from the gulf asset merger with westport 

  

the company expended approximately 1327 million in 2001 compared to 1237 million in 2000 and 1020 million in 1999 for capital expenditures these expenditures in all years represented growth projects in the equitable production segment and replacements improvements and additions to plant assets in the equitable utilities and noresco units equitable production expended 939 million in 2001 primarily for development of the appalachian region gathering system pipeline improvements and technology initiatives noresco expended 03 million for leasehold improvements and equipment additions and replacements the equitable utilities segment expended 385 million primarily for distribution plant additions and replacements and technology improvements

financing activities 

  

cash flows used in financing activities were 265 million in 2001 compared to cash flows provided of 358 million in 2000 and cash flows used of 1012 million in 1999 throughout 2001 equitable reduced its shortterm debt and bought back shares of its outstanding common stock as further described below with cash provided by operating activities in addition noresco received projectfinancing loans of 1054 million against its current construction contracts it is expected that many of the contracts underlying this financing will be sold in 2002 

  

during the first quarter of 2001 a jamaican energy infrastructure project which is among the consolidated subsidiaries experienced defaults relating to various loan covenants consequently the company reclassified the nonrecourse project financing from longterm debt to current liabilities the company is currently working on various alternatives to refinance or restructure the debt or to pursue strategic alternatives for the potential transfer or sale of the company’s project interests

in july 1999 the company repaid 750 million of 712 debentures using cash proceeds received in 1998 from the sale of its natural gas midstream operations 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature of the company’s natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices shortterm loans are used to support working capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is sold during the heating season 

  

the company has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing requirements bank loans and commercial paper supported by available credit are used to meet shortterm financing requirements interest rates on these shortterm loans averaged 41 during 2001 the company maintains a revolving credit agreement providing 325 million of available credit and a 364day credit agreement providing 325 million of available credit with a group of banks that expire in 2003 and 2002 respectively as of december 31 2001 the company has the authority and credit backing to support a 650 million commercial paper program

risk management 

  

the company’s overall objective in its hedging program is to protect earnings from undue exposure to the risk of falling commodity prices since it is primarily a natural gas company this leads to different approaches to hedging natural gas than for crude oil and natural gas liquids 

  

with respect to hedging the company’s exposure to changes in natural gas commodity prices under current market conditions management’s objective is to reduce its exposure to commodity price changes to 001 per diluted share per 010 change in the average nymex natural gas price for 2002 003 per diluted share for 2003 and less than 004 per diluted share for 2004 through 2008 in addition to monetizations the company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure the company has relied almost exclusively on fixed price swaps to accomplish the remainder of this objective during 2001 due to the increased market volatility

the company’s primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas which can affect the operating results of equitable through the equitable production segment and the unregulated marketing group within the equitable utilities segment the company’s use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is described in note b to the consolidated financial statements the company uses simple nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company’s use of these derivative financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the company’s corporate risk committee and board of directors 

  

for commodity price derivatives used to hedge forecasted company production equitable sets policy limits relative to expected production and sales levels which are exposed to price risk the level of price exposure is limited by the value at risk limits allowed by this policy volumes associated with future activities such as new drilling recompletions and acquisitions are not eligible for hedging management monitors price and production levels on a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as warranted in general equitable’s strategy is to become more highly hedged at prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels 

  

for commodity price derivatives held for trading positions the marketing group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit the net positions to specific value at risk limits in general this marketing group considers profit opportunities in both physical and financial positions and equitable’s policies apply equally thereto these financial instruments include forward contracts which may involve physical delivery of an energy commodity swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements 

  

with respect to the energy derivatives held by the company for purposes other than trading as of december 31 2001 the company continued to execute its hedging strategy by utilizing price swaps with volumes of approximately 1964 bcf of natural gas these derivatives have hedged expected equity production through 2008 a decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2001 levels would increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately 693 million 

  

with respect to derivative contracts held by the company for trading purposes as of december 31 2001 a decrease of 10 in the market price of natural gas from the december 31 2001 level would increase the fair market value by approximately 42 million 

  

the above analysis of the energy derivatives held by the company for purposes other than trading does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the company and its subsidiaries’ physical sales of natural gas the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the same time periods furthermore the energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term the energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk and as applicable anticipated transactions occur as expected 

  

the disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions if the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the energy derivatives a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first 

  

the company has variable rate shortterm debt as such there is some limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings of the company under its current capital structure

item 1 business

       equitable resources inc equitable or the company is an integrated
energy company with emphasis on appalachian area natural gas production and
transportation natural gas distribution and transmission and energy services
marketing in the northeastern section of the united states the company also has
an interest in another public company with exploration and production interests
in the gulf of mexico and rocky mountain areas and energy service management
projects in selected united states and international markets the company and
its subsidiaries offer energy natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil
products and services to wholesale and retail customers through three primary
business segments equitable utilities equitable production and noresco the
company and its subsidiaries had 1614 employees at the end of 2000

       the company was formed under the laws of pennsylvania by the
consolidation and merger in 1925 of two constituent companies the older of
which was organized in 1888 in 1984 the corporate name was changed to
equitable resources inc


equitable utilities

       equitable utilities contains both regulated and nonregulated operations
the regulated group consists of the distribution and interstate pipeline
operations while the unregulated group is involved in nonjurisdictional
marketing and trading of natural gas risk management activities and the sale of
energyrelated products and services equitable utilities generated 41 of the
companys net operating revenues in 2000


     natural gas distribution

       equitable utilities distribution operations are carried out by equitable
gas company equitable gas a division of the company the service territory
for equitable gas includes southwestern pennsylvania municipalities in northern
west virginia and field line sales in eastern kentucky the distribution
operations provide natural gas services to more than 275000 customers
comprised of 257000 residential customers and 18000 commercial and industrial
customers

       equitable gas natural gas portfolio includes shortterm mediumterm and
longterm natural gas supply contracts obtained from various sources including
purchases from major and independent producers in the southwest purchases from
local producers in the appalachian area purchases from gas marketers and third
party underground storage fields

       because many of its customers use natural gas for heating purposes
equitable gas revenues are seasonal with approximately 65 of calendar year
2000 revenues occurring during the winter heating season from november through
march significant quantities of purchased natural gas are placed in underground
storage inventory during offpeak season to accommodate higher customer demand
during the winter heating season


     interstate pipeline

       the interstate pipeline operations of equitable utilities include the
natural gas transmission and storage activities of equitrans lp equitrans
and carnegie interstate pipeline company which are regulated by the federal
energy regulatory commission ferc the pipeline division offers gas
transportation storage and related services to its affiliates and end users in
the northeast

       the evolving regulatory environment designed to increase competition in
the natural gas industry has created a number of opportunities for pipeline
companies to expand services and serve new markets the company has taken
advantage of selected market expansion opportunities concentrating on
equitrans underground storage facilities and the location and nature of its
pipeline system as a link between the countrys major longline natural gas
pipelines



                                       3
page   4

       the pipeline operations consist of approximately 2800 miles of
transmission storage and gathering lines and interconnections with five major
interstate pipelines equitrans also has 15 natural gas storage reservoirs with
approximately 500 million cubic feet mmcf per day of peak delivery capability

     energy marketing

       equitable utilities unregulated marketing operation equitable energy
purchases stores and markets natural gas at both the retail and wholesale
level primarily in the appalachian and midatlantic regions services and
products offered by the marketing division include commodity procurement and
delivery physical natural gas management operations and control and customer
support services to the companys energy customers to manage the price exposure
risk of its marketing operations the company engages in risk management
activities including the purchase and sale of financial energy derivative
products because of this activity the energy marketing division is also able
to offer energy price risk management services to its larger industrial
customers

       in conjunction with these activities the company also engages in limited
trading activity equitable energy uses prudent asset management to leverage the
companys assets through trading activities trading activities are entered into
with the objective of profiting from exposure to shifts in market prices


     rates and regulation

       equitables distribution rates terms of service contracts with
affiliates and issuance of securities are regulated primarily by the
pennsylvania public utility commission puc along with the kentucky public
service commission and the public service commission of west virginia pipeline
safety is generally regulated by the rules of the federal department of
transportation andor by the state regulatory commission the occupational and
health and safety administration osha also imposes certain additional safety
regulations

       the availability terms and cost of transportation significantly affect
sales of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of
natural gas is subject to federal regulation including transportation rates
storage tariffs and various other matters primarily by the ferc federal and
state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline
transportation the fercs regulations for interstate natural gas transmission
in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural
gas for additional discussion of regulatory matters involving equitable
utilities see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations mda


     acquisitions and divestitures

       on december 15 1999 equitable acquired the distribution transmission
and production operations of carnegie natural gas and subsidiaries carnegie
for 400 million including transaction costs the carnegie acquisition is
complementary to equitables plans to grow its core business and increase
utilization and operational efficiencies of its local distribution and
interstate pipeline operations the acquisition of carnegie added approximately
8000 new distribution customers see note g to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information related to the carnegie acquisition


     competitive environment

       various regulatory and market trends have combined to increase
competition in markets served by equitable gas in addition equitable gas faces
price competition with other energy forms the changes precipitated by the ferc
restructuring of the natural gas industry in order no 636 have significantly
increased competition in the natural gas industry in the restructured
marketplace competition is increasing to provide natural gas sales to
commercial and residential customers however since equitable gas has been
managing a transportation service and gas supply risk for a number of years the
transition to a more competitive environment under order no 636 has not had a
significant impact on its operations equitable gas has responded to this
competitive environment by offering a variety of firm and interruptible
services including natural gas transportation supply pooling balancing and
brokering to industrial and commercial customers



                                       4
page   5

       gas industry competition at the retail level is receiving increased
attention from both regulators and legislators in june 1999 pennsylvania
governor tom ridge signed into law the natural gas choice and competition act
the act which required local natural gas distribution companies to extend the
availability of natural gas transportation service to residential and commercial
customers by july 1 2000 pursuant to a pucapproved plan in accordance with
the act equitable gas made its restructuring filing on august 16 1999 the
filing was generally a restatement of equitable gas existing tariff previously
in effect the tariff provides for recovery of costs associated with equitable
gas existing pipeline capacity and natural gas supply contracts after
negotiations with intervenors settlement was reached with all parties the puc
entered an opinion and order adopting the settlement and equitable gas
restructured rates and services became effective july 1 2000


equitable production

       equitable production develops produces and delivers natural gas and
crude oil with operations in the appalachian region of the united states it
also engages in natural gas gathering and interstate transportation and the
processing and sale of natural gas liquids equitable production generated
approximately 53 of the companys net operating revenues in 2000

       equitable production is one of the largest owners of proved natural gas
reserves in the appalachian basin the companys exploration and production
properties are located in the appalachian basin which is the oldest and
geographically one of the largest natural gas producing regions in the united
states equitable production currently owns 8274 net producing wells in
appalachia as of december 31 2000 the company estimates the total proved
reserves to be 2206 billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe including undeveloped
reserves of 602 bcfe

       the areas in which the companys appalachian properties are located are
characterized by wells with comparatively low rates of annual decline in
production low production costs and high british thermal unit btu or energy
content once drilled and completed wells in the appalachian basin typically
have low ongoing operating and maintenance requirements and minimal capital
expenditures these formations are characterized by slow recovery of the
reserves in place low rates of production and wells that generally produce for
longer than 20 years and often more than 50 years many of the companys wells
in these areas have been producing for many years in some cases since the early
1900s reserve estimates for properties with long production histories are
generally more reliable than estimates for properties with shorter histories

       substantially all of the appalachian wells are relatively shallow with
depths ranging from 1000 to 7000 feet below the surface many of these wells
are completed in more than one producing zone and production from these zones
may be mixed or commingled commingled production lowers producing costs on a
per unit basis compared to isolated zone completions the average btu content
for each cubic foot of natural gas produced from the companys appalachian
properties is approximately 1130 at the wellhead which has historically
provided an average 13 premium over the standard measure of 1000 btu per cubic
foot when calculating realized prices on a per thousand cubic feet mcf basis

       the productive lives of producing natural gas properties are often
compared using their reservetoproduction index this index is calculated by
dividing total proved reserves of the property by annual production for the
prior 12 months the reservetoproduction index for the underlying properties
at december 31 2000 was approximately 23 years this reservetoproduction
index shows a relatively long producing life compared to an average index of 13
years for us natural gas properties at yearend 1999 because production rates
naturally decline over time the reservetoproduction index may not be a useful
estimate of how long properties should economically produce based on the
companys reserve report production from the underlying properties is expected
to continue for at least 50 more years

       equitable production currently has an inventory of 37 million gross
acres of which approximately 71 have not been developed as of december 31
2000 the company estimated the proved undeveloped reserves of the underlying
leases to be 602 bcfe from 1800 proved undeveloped drilling locations in the
last three years equitable production has completed approximately 99 of the
wells it has drilled in appalachia



                                       5
page   6

       in december 1999 the unregulated production properties and well
operations of equitable utilities equitrans pipeline division were transferred
to equitable production appalachian these properties include 800 producing
natural gas wells and 389 bcfe of proved developed reserves


     acquisitions and divestitures

       in february 2000 the company acquired the appalachian production assets
of statoil energy inc statoil for 630 million plus working capital
adjustments for a total of 677 million statoils operations consisted of
approximately 12 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves and 6500
gross natural gas wells in west virginia kentucky virginia pennsylvania and
ohio

       in april 2000 the company combined its gulf of mexico operations with
westport oil and gas company for 50 million in cash and approximately 49
interest in the combined company westport resources corporation westport in
october 2000 westport had a successful initial public offering ipo of its
shares equitable sold 1325 million shares in this ipo for an aftertax gain of
43 million equitable now owns 13911 million shares or approximately 36
interest in the company equitables equity in westport was 1301 million as of
december 31 2000

       on june 30 2000 equitable sold a substantial portion of its interest in
properties qualifying for nonconventional fuel tax credit to a partnership that
netted 1222 million in cash and retained a minority interest in this
partnership the proceeds received were used to pay down shortterm debt
associated with the statoil acquisition prior to this transaction the company
entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production
removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a 70
million pretax charge recorded as other loss equitable accounted for its
remaining 263 million investment under the equity method of accounting
equitable estimates that it will receive 60 million in fees for operating the
wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the purchaser in 2001
based on expected production volumes

       in december 2000 equitable sold 1333 bcfe of reserves acquired from
statoil to a trust for proceeds of 2558 million and a minority interest in
this trust in anticipation of this transaction the company had previously
entered into financial hedges removal of these hedges upon closing of this
transaction resulted in a 577 million charge that was equally offset against
the gain recognized on the sale of these properties the proceeds received were
used to pay down shortterm debt associated with the statoil acquisition
equitable accounted for its 362 million investment under the equity method of
accounting equitable estimates that it will receive 120 million in fees for
operating the wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the
purchaser in 2001 based on expected production volumes

       in 2000 the company entered into two natural gas advance sale contracts
for 487 mmcf of reserves the company is required to deliver certain quantities
of natural gas during the term of the contracts the first contract is for five
years with net proceeds of 1040 million the second contract is for three
years with net proceeds of 1048 million as such these contracts were
recorded as prepaid gas forward sales and are being recognized in income as
deliveries occur the proceeds received were used to pay down shortterm debt
associated with the statoil acquisition

     competitive environment

       the combination of its longlived production low drilling costs high
drilling completion rates at shallow depths and proximity to natural gas markets
has had a substantial impact on the development of the appalachian basin
resulting in a highly fragmented operating environment in 2000 kentucky and
west virginia had approximately 3000 independent operators and 90000 producing
natural gas and oil wells also the historical availability of tax incentives
has resulted in extensive drilling in the shallow formations with these low
technical risk characteristics


     hedging activities

       equitable has historically entered into hedging contracts with respect to
its natural gas and crude oil production at specified prices for a specified
period of time the companys hedging strategy and information regarding
derivative instruments used are outlined below in item 7a qualitative and
quantitative disclosures about market risk and in note b to the consolidated
financial statements

consolidated results of operations

       equitables consolidated net income from continuing operations for 2000
was 1062 million or 320 per diluted share compared with 691 million or
201 per diluted share for 1999 and a loss of 271 million or 073 per
diluted share for 1998

       the improved 2000 earnings are due to increased natural gas production
attributable to the acquisition of statoils appalachian oil and gas properties
higher commodity prices increased throughput associated with the carnegie
acquisition and lower operating and administrative expenses throughout the
organization due to continuing process improvement efforts in all significant
business units the 2000 earnings were partially offset by increased
performancerelated incentive costs that were not allocated to business
segments

       earnings for 1999 increased over 1998 as a result of increased natural
gas production increased throughput in the regulated distribution operations
primarily due to colder weather lower exploration costs and lower operating
and administrative expenses throughout the organization due to prior years
restructuring efforts


     business segment results

       business segment operating results are presented in the segment
discussions and financial tables on the following pages headquarters operating
expenses are billed to operating segments based on a fixed allocation of the

       operating income for equitable utilities increased 153 from 1999 to
2000 the increase in 2000 is a result of higher net revenues due principally to
the carnegie acquisition and cooler weather during the heating season results
for the 2000 period include 9 million for the recovery of stranded costs in
rates from the previously mentioned equitrans rate case settlement which was
partially offset by charges of 15 million for improvement of utility segment
operating processes and consolidation of facilities results for 1999 benefited
from the recognition of the settlement of equitrans rate case which included
stranded cost recovery that had a positive net result of 39 million this
benefit was principally offset by charges of 30 million for improvement of
utility segment operating processes and consolidation of facilities excluding
the impact of the rate case settlement and process improvement charges in both
periods operating income increased 138 million or 173 over the 797
million in 1999

       operating income for equitable utilities increased 151 from 1998 to
1999 the increase in 1999 is a result of higher net revenues due principally to
cooler weather during the heating season increased revenues from energy
marketing activities and lower operating expenses due to restructuring
initiatives begun in the fourth quarter of 1998 results for the 1999 period
include 39 million from the recognition of the settlement of equitrans rate
case described above this benefit was principally offset by charges of 30
million for improvement of utility segment operating processes and consolidation
of facilities results for 1998 include a pretax charge of 147 million related
to restructuring as more fully described in note c to the consolidated financial
statements excluding the nonrecurring items in both periods operating income

       net revenues for the distribution operations increased 103 from 1999 to
2000 the increase in net revenues for 2000 is due principally to the total
system throughput increase from the carnegie gas acquisition and the impact of

       net revenues for the distribution operations increased 87 from 1998 to
1999 the increase in net revenues for 1999 is due to the impact of weather that
was 14 colder than the prior year in addition total margin from delivery
service customers was higher in 1999 reflecting higher average delivery rates
and slightly higher volumes transported

       operating expenses for the distribution operations for 1999 decreased
124 from 1998 results for the 1998 period include 29 million related to the
restructuring of utility segment operating functions and consolidation of
facilities excluding the restructuring charges in 1998 operating expenses
decreased 99 million or 98 over the 1001 million in 1998 the decrease
in 1999 is due principally to restructuring initiatives begun in the fourth
quarter of 1998

       operating income for 1999 increased 644 from the operating income of
1998 excluding the impact of the 1998 restructuring charges the increase was

       net revenues for energy marketing operations increased 713 from 1999 to
2000 the increase in net revenues is attributable to greater sales volumes
associated with asset management activities and higher unit margins in
addition the sale of gas in storage during the first quarter of 2000 allowed
the company to benefit from the increasing natural gas prices

       operating expenses increased 485 from 1999 to 2000 the increase in
expenses is due principally to the increased investment in the segments asset
management and retail marketing activities

       net revenues for energy marketing operations increased 463 from 1998 to
1999 the increase in gross margins in 1999 is attributable to increased
throughput and more effective use of storage the increased volume in 1999
compared to 1998 is a result of the addition of residential customer choice
programs in pennsylvania and ohio and increased utilitymarketing company
volumes transported during the 1999 winter heating season gross margin per
mmbtu was also higher in 1999 due primarily to the residential choice programs
and greater volatility in weather in 1999

       the 1999 decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to a significant
staff reduction and office closings completed as part of the corporatewide
restructuring in the fourth quarter of 1998

equitable production

       production operations comprise the production gathering transportation
and sale of natural gas in april 2000 the company merged its equitable
production  gulf business with westport oil and gas company to form westport
resources corporation westport the operations of equitable production  gulf
through the date of the merger are presented after the operations of equitable
production appalachian

       the operational and financial data presented below have been reclassified
to reflect the results in two business lines  production and production
services production includes owned production which comprises equity volumes
ie unaffected by monetizations and monetized volumes under the two
prepaid gas forward sales and the 1995 sale of interests in certain appalachian
natural gas properties as described in notes m and n to the consolidated
financial statements cash is received in the period in which these monetization
transactions are executed in subsequent periods monetized revenues are
recognized as volumes are delivered but no additional cash is received the
prices shown for owned production are wellhead prices which exclude gathering
fees but includes financial hedges crude oil and natural gas liquid ngl
product sales have been converted to natural gas volume equivalents and are
included in the mcfe volumes described production service revenues and
volumes include gathering revenues and other revenues principally fees for
operating production in which equitable production sold an interest as
described previously in item 1 of this form 10k total volumes handled include
all gathered volumes volumes sold at the wellhead and not gathered and crude
oil and natural gas liquid equivalents


     equitable production appalachian

       in february 2000 equitable production acquired the appalachian
production assets of statoil for 630 million plus working capital adjustments
for a total of 677 million statoils operations consisted of approximately 12
trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves and 6500 natural gas wells
in west virginia kentucky virginia pennsylvania and ohio in december 1999
the company acquired carnegie carnegie production company operated more than
1000 natural gas wells in pennsylvania and west virginia

       in the appalachian region during 2000 305 gross wells were drilled at a
success rate of 993 this drilling was concentrated within the core areas of
southwest virginia west virginia and southeast kentucky this activity resulted
in an additional 213 mmcf per day of gas sales and developed reserve additions
of 993 bcfe


     capital expenditures

       equitable production has set the 2001 capital budget level at 96
million this includes 73 million for development of appalachian holdings 17
million for improvements to gathering system pipelines and 6 million for
technology initiatives the evaluation of new development locations market
forecasts and price trends for natural gas and oil will continue to be the
principal factors for the economic justification of drilling and gathering
system investments

       revenues from production which are derived primarily from the sale of
produced natural gas increased 1436 from 1999 to 2000 the increase in
revenues from production of 1331 million from 1999 to 2000 is due primarily to
increases in sales volumes related to the statoil acquisition and higher
effective commodity prices the statoil acquisition added 321 billion cubic
feet equivalent bcfe of sales in the current year equitable productions
average selling prices for natural gas increased 330 over the same period the
increase in revenues realized was reduced by the recognition of 776 million in
hedge losses the revenue from gathering fees increased 826 primarily due to
the increase in gathered volumes related to the statoil acquisition other
revenues increased



                                       19

by 60 million due to the sale of nonconventional fuel tax credits acquired
from statoil and from service fees from the sale of interests in producing
properties

       operating expenses for the period ended december 31 2000 totaled 1685
million an increase of 830 million from the same period in 1999 with the
increase due primarily to the statoil acquisition gathering and compression
expenses per mcfe decreased 182 due to lower cost gathering on the acquired
assets general and administrative expenses per mcfe declined 303 due to
initial synergies from the acquisitions severance taxes per mcfe increased due
to increased natural gas sales prices

       revenues from production increased 58 from 1998 to 1999 the increase
in revenues from production of 51 million in 1999 compared to 1998 is due
primarily to increases in natural gas sales prices 80 million offset by a
decrease in monetized sales volumes 29 million in addition 1998 includes
26 million of direct bill revenues resulting from a ferc pricing settlement
as described in note d to the consolidated financial statements the 43
million decrease in revenues from gathering fees is a result of a decrease in
capacity fees earned at kentucky west virginia gas company due to the
expiration of certain longterm contracts

       operating expenses excluding the 1998 restructuring charges decreased
21 in 1999 from 1998 included in 1999 operating expenses is 28 million
related to process improvements including the companys decision to close its
regional office in kingsport tennessee consolidate administration and realign
field offices 20 million of charges related to the decertification of
kentucky west virginia gas company llc and 18 million in performancerelated
compensation partially offsetting these items are 7 million and 10 million
reductions in environmental and pension liabilities respectively overall the
decrease in operating expenses in 1999 excluding the items above is due to
continued improvements in operating efficiencies and decreased staff as a
result of the initiatives begun in 1998

       in the second quarter 2000 equitable sold 66 bcfe of reserves to a
partnership for 1222 million and an interest in the partnership this volume
represents seven years production from wells acquired from statoil that contain
approximately 200 bcfe of proved reserves the proceeds from this sale were used
to pay down acquisitionrelated shortterm debt prior to the transaction the
company entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of the
production removal of these hedges upon closing of the transactions resulted in
a 7 million pretax charge recorded as other loss equitable estimates that it
will receive 60 million in fees for operating the wells and gathering and
marketing the gas on behalf of the purchaser in 2001 based on expected
production volumes

       in december 2000 equitable sold 1333 bcfe of reserves acquired from
statoil to a trust for proceeds of 2558 million and a minority interest in the
trust in anticipation of this transaction the company had previously entered
into financial hedges removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction
resulted in a 577 million charge that was equally offset against the gain
recognized on the sale of these properties the proceeds received were used to
pay down shortterm debt associated with the statoil acquisition equitable
accounted for its 362 million investment under the equity method of
accounting equitable estimates that it will receive 120 million in fees for
operating the wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the
purchaser in 2001 based on expected production volumes

       in 2000 the company entered into two natural gas advance sale contracts
for 487 mmcf of reserves the company is required to sell and deliver certain
quantities of natural gas during the term of the contracts the first contract
is for five years with net proceeds of 1040 million the second contract is
for three years with net proceeds of 1048 million as such these contracts
were recorded as prepaid gas forward sale and are being recognized in income as
deliveries occur the proceeds received were used to pay down shortterm debt
associated with the statoil acquisition

       on december 10 2000 a labor situation involving the kentucky west
virginia unit of equitable production and members of the local pace labor union
was settled after a 56day strike which had curtailed production in the region
the agreement reached between the company and the union resulted in a decrease
in the represented work force in this unit by 85 people this reduction from 152
to 67 resulted in a fourth quarter charge of 187 million recorded as
operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated income statement it is
expected that ongoing cost savings from the labor settlement will be
approximately 50 million per year

     equitable production  gulf

       as described above the equitable production  gulf operations were
merged into westport effective april 1 2000 the following description included
results prior to the merger during 2000 seven gross wells were drilled at a
success rate of 86

       in the gulf region during 1999 153 gross wells were drilled at a success
rate of 82 this activity resulted in additions of 485 bcfe the increase was
the result of successful development of the west cameron block 180 and 198
fields and south marsh island 39 field equitable production gulf operated both
fields

       equitable production also participated in exploratory activity during
1999 including a successful well at south timbalier 196 in which equitable
production had a 50 working interest unsuccessful exploratory activity during
1999 on the west cameron 575 and the eugene island 44 blocks resulted in dry
hole expense of approximately 25 million in 1999

       results of operations for the gulf in 2000 include only the first
quarter during that period revenues per mcfe increased 18 over the full year
1999 average due to increased commodity prices sales volumes decreased due to
the faster decline of gulf production and decreased drilling during 2000
operating expenses per unit were essentially unchanged from 1999

       revenues from production for the gulf operations increased 237 from
1998 to 1999 the increase in revenues from production of 122 million in 1999
compared to 1998 is due primarily to increases in natural gas and crude oil
sales volumes of 80 million and 21 million respectively in addition
higher commodity prices in 1999 contributed 18 million to the increase in
revenues from production

       operating expenses decreased 543 in 1999 from 1998 the 1998 expenses
include 371 million of restructuring charges and 231 million of dry hole
expense associated with the unsuccessful drilling of five wells in 1999 two
unsuccessful exploratory wells were drilled for a total of 25 million of dry
hole cost other exploration expenses increased 20 million in 1999 due
primarily to a lease impairment and the impairment of an equity investment in an
oil and natural gas production company dda increased 18 million in 1999
because of increased production the remaining positive variance of 62 million
is due to continued improvements in operating efficiencies and decreased staff

       a beginning in 2000 backlog is presented on a revenue basis for
comparison purposes the 1999 and 1998 backlog was restated to conform with the
2000 presentation


       revenues decreased from 1999 to 2000 by 350 million or 206
primarily caused by low construction backlog at the end of 1999 in addition
noresco refined its focus on larger projects with higher gross margin gross
margins increased to 248 in 2000 from 215 in 1999 reflecting a focus on
higher margin producing products and services and a gross profit increase in a
few operational energy services projects during the fourth quarter of 2000
noresco completed receivable sales resulting in a 20 million decrease in gross
margin and ebit

       revenue backlog increased to 910 million at yearend 2000 from
710 million at yearend 1999 the increase in backlog is attributable to an
increase in the energy infrastructure project backlog a substantial portion of
the backlog is expected to be completed within the next 18 months

       total construction completed during 2000 was 851 million versus 1517
million a decrease of 666 million over 1999 this decrease was primarily due
to a 45 million decrease in construction of energy infrastructure projects in
1999




                                       22
page   23


       sga expenses increased from 1999 to 2000 by 30 million increases
during 2000 were 10 million related to the decision to discontinue developing
international energy infrastructure projects and the integrating of this
separate division with the energy services contracting business other costs
include 04 million of additional costs related to the closing of three
unprofitable energy services contracting offices in the northwest united states

       depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense decreased from
1999 to 2000 by 08 million or 127 this decrease was primarily due to a
writedown of computer software development in 1999

       revenues increased from 1998 to 1999 by 601 million or 55 reflecting
the continued expansion of the business total construction completed during
1999 was 1518 million an increase of 720 million over 1998

       gross margins from energy services contracting activities decreased to
215 in 1999 from 262 in 1998 the deterioration in gross margin results
mainly from the higher proportion of lower margin government contracts
implemented in 1999

offset by a 07 million reduction in corporate overhead expense

       depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense increased from
1998 to 1999 by 18 million or 413 this increase is primarily due to the
companys cogeneration facility in jamaica which was put into service in
february 1999

norescos share of the earnings from its equity investments in power plant

1998 restructuring impairment and other nonrecurring charges

       during 1998 management expressed its intention to focus on fundamental
strengths in its core businesses in october 1998 the companys board of
directors approved a restructuring plan as a result of this plan along with
its earlier decision to discontinue and sell the natural gas midstream business
and the sustained decrease in oil and natural gas commodity prices the company
took specific actions to reduce its overall cost structure certain of the
actions taken by the company resulted in pretax impairment restructuring and
other nonrecurring charges in the fourth quarter of 1998 amounting to 818
million the restructuring activities shown below in tabular format primarily
relate to the following

       the elimination of employment positions companywide early in the fourth
quarter of 1998 the company announced that the restructuring plan would
eliminate a substantial number of positions related charges included severance
packages cash payments made directly to terminated employees as well as
outplacement services and noncash charges for curtailment of certain defined
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans a total of 164 employees
terminated employment

       redirection of offshore gulf production as a result of the decrease in
oil and natural gas prices and unsuccessful drilling results in several of the
companys nonoperated blocks a review of the gulf operations was undertaken
the company eliminated several layers of management and focused its operations
on lower risk companyoperated exploration and development in addition the
production and commodity price trends indicated that the undiscounted cash flows
from this division would be substantially less than the carrying value of the
producing properties producing property writedowns were measured based on a
comparison of the assets net book value to the net present value of the
properties estimated future net cash flows the undeveloped leases no longer
intended to be developed were written down to estimated market value less costs
to dispose

       equity earnings of nonconsolidated investments increased in 2000 from
1999 primarily due to the equity earnings from the companys ownership in
westport in october 2000 westport resources corporation had a successful
initial public offering ipo of its shares equitable sold 1325 million shares
in this ipo for a pretax gain of 66 million

       on june 30 2000 equitable sold a substantial portion of its interest in
properties qualifying for nonconventional fuel tax credit to a partnership which
netted 1222 million in cash and retained a minority interest in this
partnership in anticipation of this transaction the company had previously
entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production
removal of these hedges upon closing of this transaction resulted in a 70
million pretax charge recorded as other loss

       interest costs increased in 2000 as a result of the acquisition of
statoils appalachian assets which increased average debt outstanding by 580
million the outstanding debt was reduced significantly during the fourth
quarter by the proceeds received from the two prepaid gas forward sales the
sale of reserves to a trust and sales of assets interest expense also increased
as a result of higher interest rates in 2000 compared to 1999

       interest costs decreased in 1999 as a result of an 86 million decrease
in average debt outstanding due to proceeds from the sale in late 1998 of the
natural gas midstream operations lower capital expenditures and improved cash
flows from operations the savings from the lower debt level were partially
offset by a slightly higher overall interest rate due to the full year effect
of the preferred trust debentures issued in 1998

       average annual interest rates on shortterm debt were 64 for 2000 and
ranged from 50 to 57 between 1998 and 1999

capital resources and liquidity


     operating activities

         cash flows provided from continuing operating activities were 3612
million in 2000 compared to 1543 million in 1999 and 1147 million in 1998
operating cash flows used in discontinued operations in 1998 were 245 million
cash flows from operations primarily increased in 2000 as a result of the 371
million increase in net income from 1999 and from cash received in december 2000
from two natural gas advance sale contracts recorded as prepaid gas forward
sale

         equitable utilities distribution and energy marketing operations had
increased accounts receivable inventory and deferred purchased gas costs due to
the increased natural gas commodity prices and the increased marketed gas sales
volumes in 2000 compared to 1999 this negative operating cash flow effect was
partially offset by the increase in accounts payable also attributable to the
higher gas prices and increased volumes

         deferred income taxes increased from the prior year primarily due to
the statoil acquisition and the deferred taxes associated with the undistributed
earnings from westport the undistributed earnings from nonconsolidated
investments also increased from 1999 principally as a result of the asset merger
with westport

       during 1998 the company divested its natural gas midstream operations
for 3383 million which included working capital adjustments prior to this
divestiture these operations had entered into large volume natural gas trading
contracts with expiration dates in 1999 subsequent to the divestiture these
contracts were served out by the marketing operations of equitable utilities
the balance in accounts receivable and payable at december 31 1998 included
424 million and 448 million respectively related to these deals which did
not recur in 1999 there were no other significant changes in cash flows from
operations between 1998 and 1999


     investing activities

       cash flows used in investing activities were 3630 million in 2000 and
1375 in 1999 compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of 1420
million in 1998 cash used in investing activities in 2000 primarily include the
first quarter acquisition of statoil properties for 630 million plus working
capital adjustments for a total of 677 million and the increase in equity in
nonconsolidated investments due to the westport merger and the ownership
interests received in the sales of producing properties in june and december
2000

       cash provided in investing activities in 2000 includes the net proceeds
received from the reserve sales totaling 3829 million the proceeds received
from the westport merger the proceeds received from the sale of 1325 million
shares of westport stock in conjunction with the westport ipo and the proceeds
received from the noresco receivable sales in the fourth quarter

       the company expended approximately 1237 million in 2000 compared to
1020 million in 1999 and 1587 million in 1998 for continuing operations
capital expenditures these expenditures in all years represented growth
projects in the equitable production segment and replacements improvements and
additions to plant assets in the equitable utilities and noresco units
equitable production invested 847 million in 2000 in the appalachian region
for new coalbed methane and conventional natural gas wells in addition to its
equity in nonconsolidated investments noresco expended 16 million for
leasehold improvements and equipment additions and replacements the equitable
utilities segment expended 284 million for distribution plant replacements and
improvements the company had 320 million in discontinued operations capital
expenditures in 1998

       a total of 175 million has been authorized for the 2001 capital
expenditure program as previously described in the business segment results
the company expects to finance this program with cash generated from operations
and with shortterm loans

       in december 1999 the company acquired carnegie for 40 million
including natural gas distribution pipeline exploration and production
operations



                                       26
page   27


       during 1998 the company completed its sales of its natural gas midstream
operations for 3383 million proceeds from the sales were used to reduce
outstanding debt repurchase shares of the companys common stock and for
operating purposes


     financing activities

        cash flows provided from financing activities were 358 million in 2000
compared to cash flows used of 1012 million and 1992 million in 1999 and
1998 respectively financing activities in 2000 included the 630 million
increase in shortterm financing associated with the first quarter 2000 statoil
acquisition shortterm loans were significantly reduced in the second and
fourth quarters of 2000 resulting from the proceeds from the companys sales and
monetizations of 248 bcfe of reserves in several transactions

       the company continued its october 1998 stock buyback program in 2000
total purchases under the program of 67 million shares include 6 million
shares of stock repurchased in 2000 for 295 million in total the company has
repurchased 127 of shares outstanding at december 31 2000 on july 19 2000
the board of directors approved a resolution to increase the shares authorized
for repurchase to 94 million

       cash generated in all years was partially offset by the payment of the
companys dividends on common shares which for 2000 1999 and 1998 were 385
million 404 million and 438 million respectively

       in july 1999 the company repaid 750 million of 712 debentures
using cash proceeds received in 1998 from the sale of its natural gas midstream
operations

       in 1999 the company received proceeds of 170 million from the issuance
of nonrecourse debt used to finance a cogeneration facility owned by a
subsidiary of the company and located in jamaica the note is secured by the
assets of the jamaican facility


     shortterm borrowings

       cash required for operations is affected primarily by the seasonal nature
of the companys natural gas distribution operations and the volatility of oil
and natural gas commodity prices shortterm loans are used to support working
capital requirements during the summer months and are repaid as natural gas is
sold during the heating season

         the company has adequate borrowing capacity to meet its financing
requirements bank loans and commercial paper supported by available credit
are used to meet shortterm financing requirements interest rates on these
shortterm loans averaged 637 during 2000 the company maintains a revolving
credit agreement with a group of banks providing 325 million of available
credit which expires in 2003 the company also maintains a 364day credit
agreement with a group of banks providing 325 million of available credit
which expires in 2001 as of december 31 2000 the company has the authority
and credit backing to support a 650 million commercial paper program


     risk management

       the companys overall objective in its hedging program is to protect
earnings from undue exposure to the risk of falling commodity prices since it
is primarily a natural gas company this leads to different approaches to
hedging natural gas than for crude oil and natural gas liquids

       with respect to hedging the companys exposure to changes in natural gas
commodity prices managements objective is to provide price protection for the
majority of expected production for the year 2001 its preference is to use
derivative instruments that create a price floor in order to provide downside
protection while allowing the company to participate in a portion of the upward
price movements this is accomplished with the use of a mix of costless collars
straight floors and some fixed price swaps this mix allows the company to
participate in a range of prices while protecting shareholders from significant
price deterioration



                                       27
page   28

       crude oil and natural gas liquids prices are currently at relatively high
levels compared to historical averages as a result the company has used swaps
and other derivative instruments to lock in current prices for the majority of
expected production of crude oil and of natural gas liquids for the year 2001


     equity in nonconsolidated investments

       the company within the noresco segment has equity ownership interests
in independent power plant ipp projects located domestically and in select
international countries longterm power purchase agreements ppas are signed

plant the length of these contracts range from 5 to 30 years the company has
invested approximately 327 million in these operations since january 1998 the
companys share of the earnings for this same time period is approximately 106
million these projects generally are financed on a project basis with
nonrecourse financings established at the foreign subsidiary level

       in april 2000 the company combined its gulf of mexico operations with
westport oil and gas company for 50 million in cash and approximately 49

resulted in equitable production retaining minority interest in a resulting
partnership and trust the partnership and trust properties include assets that
qualify for nonconventional fuels tax credits both of these investments are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting


     acquisitions and dispositions

and reduced its ownership percentage to approximately 36

         on june 30 2000 equitable sold a substantial portion of its interest
in properties qualifying for nonconventional fuel tax credit to a partnership
which netted 1222 million in cash and retained a minority interest in this
partnership the proceeds received were used to pay down shortterm debt
associated with the statoil acquisition prior to the transaction the company
entered into financial hedges covering the first two years of production

million pretax charge recorded as other loss equitable accounted for its
remaining 263 million investment under the equity method of accounting
equitable estimates that it will receive 60 million in fees for operating the
wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the purchaser in 2001
based on expected production volumes

statoil to a trust for proceeds of 2558 million and a minority interest in
this trust in anticipation of this transaction the company had previously
entered into financial hedges removal of these hedges upon closing of this
transaction resulted in a 577 million charge that was equally offset against
the gain recognized on the sale of these properties the proceeds received were
used to pay down shortterm debt associated with the statoil acquisition
equitable accounted for its 362 million investment under the equity method of
accounting equitable estimates that it will receive 120 million in fees for
operating the wells and gathering and marketing the gas on behalf of the

rate regulation

       accounting for the operations of equitables utilities segment is in
accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as
described in note a to the consolidated financial statements regulatory assets
and liabilities are recorded to reflect future collections or payments through

and local environmental laws and regulations that affect their operations
governmental authorities may enforce these laws and regulations with a variety
of civil and criminal enforcement measures including monetary penalties
assessment and remediation requirements and injunctions as to future activities

       management does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have
a material effect on equitables financial position or results of operations

approximately 87 million is accrued at december 31 2000 environmental
matters are described in note v to the consolidated financial statements


inflation and the effect of changing energy prices

       the rate of inflation in the united states has been moderate over the
past several years and has not significantly affected the profitability of the
company in prior periods of high general inflation oil and natural gas prices
generally increased at comparable rates however there is no assurance that
this will be the case in the current environment or in possible future periods
of high inflation regulated utility operations would be required to file a
general rate case in order to recover higher costs of operations margins in the
energy marketing business in the equitable utilities segment are highly
sensitive to competitive pressures and may not reflect the effects of inflation
the results of operations in the companys three business segments will be
affected by future changes in oil and natural gas prices and the
interrelationship between oil natural gas and other energy prices


audit committee

       the audit committee composed entirely of outside directors meets
periodically with equitables independent auditors and management to review the
companys financial statements and the results of audit activities the audit
committee in turn reports to the board of directors on the results of its
review and recommends the selection of independent auditors

forwardlooking statements

       disclosures in the annual report on form 10k contain statements that
express the expectations of future plans objectives and anticipated financial
performance of the company and its subsidiaries future cost savings growth and
operational matters including labor relations and constitute forwardlooking
statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the private securities
litigation act of 1995 except as otherwise disclosed the companys
forwardlooking statements do not reflect the impact of the possible or pending
acquisitions divestitures or restructurings we undertake no obligation to
correct or update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new
information future events or otherwise all statements based on future
expectations rather than on historical facts are forwardlooking statements that
are dependent on certain events risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated some of these include but
are not limited to economic and competitive conditions earnings to be recorded
for the companys investment in westport inflation rates changing prices
legislative and regulatory changes obtaining necessary regulatory approvals
financial market conditions availability of financing curtailments or
disruptions in production future business decisions and other uncertainties
all of which are difficult to predict there are numerous uncertainties inherent
in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future
rates of production and timing of development expenditures the total amount or
timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and
production estimates in addition the drilling of development and exploratory
wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing success
rates and cost overruns and these risks can be affected by lease and rig
availability complex geology and other factors although the company engages in
hedging activities to mitigate risks fluctuations in future crude oil and gas
prices could affect materially the companys financial position and results of
operations furthermore the company cannot guarantee the absence of errors in
input data calculations and formulas used in estimates assumptions and
forecasts




item 7a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk

       the companys primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future
prices for natural gas crude oil and propane which can affect the operating
results of equitable through the equitable production segment and the
unregulated marketing group within the equitable utilities segment the
companys use of derivatives to reduce the effect of this volatility is
described in note b to the consolidated financial statements the company uses
simple nonleveraged derivative instruments that are placed with major
institutions whose creditworthiness is continually monitored the company also
enters into energy trading contracts to leverage its assets and limit the
exposure to shifts in market prices the companys use of these derivative
financial instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by the
board of directors

       for commodity price derivatives used to hedge company production
equitable sets policy limits relative to expected production and sales levels
which are exposed to price risk the level of price exposure is limited by the
value at risk limits allowed by this policy volumes associated with future
activities such as new drilling recompletions and acquisitions are not
eligible for hedging management monitors price and production levels on
essentially a continuous basis and will make adjustments to quantities hedged as
warranted in general equitables strategy is to become more highly hedged at
prices considered to be at the upper end of historical levels

       for commodity price derivatives held for trading positions the marketing
group will engage in financial transactions also subject to policies that limit
the net positions to specific value at risk limits in general this marketing
group considers profit opportunities in both physical and financial positions
and equitables policies apply equally thereto these financial instruments
include forward contracts which may involve physical delivery of an energy
commodity swap agreements which may require payments to or receipt of
payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and
variable price for the commodity options and other contractual agreements

       with respect to the energy derivatives held by the company for purposes
other than trading as of december 31 2000 a decrease of 10 in the market
price of natural gas and crude oil from the december 31 2000 levels would
increase the fair value of the natural gas instruments by approximately 127
million and would increase the fair value of the crude oil instruments by
approximately 10 million a 10 decrease would have minimal impact on the fair
value of the propane instruments

       with respect to derivative contracts held by the company for trading
purposes as of december 31 2000 a decrease of 10 in the market price of
natural gas from the december 31 2000 level would increase the fair value by
approximately 19 million there were no crude oil or propane instruments held
for trading purposes

page   31


       the above analysis of the energy derivatives utilized for risk management
purposes does not include the unfavorable impact that the same hypothetical
price movement would have on the company and its subsidiaries physical sales of
natural gas the portfolio of energy derivatives held for risk management
purposes approximates the notional quantity of the expected or committed
transaction volume of physical commodities with commodity price risk for the
same time periods furthermore the energy derivative portfolio is managed to
complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within
limits therefore an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of
energy derivatives held for risk management purposes associated with the
hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a
favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions assuming the
energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term the
energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying
risk and as applicable anticipated transactions occur as expected

       the disclosure with respect to the energy derivatives relies on the
assumption that the contracts will exist parallel to the underlying physical
transactions if the underlying transactions or positions are liquidated prior
to the maturity of the energy derivatives a loss on the financial instruments
may occur or the options might be worthless as determined by the prevailing
market value on their termination or maturity date whichever comes first

       the company has variable rate shortterm debt as such there is some
limited exposure to future earnings due to changes in interest rates a 100
basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant
impact on future earnings of the company
